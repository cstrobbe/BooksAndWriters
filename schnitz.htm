<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Austrian dramatist, novelist,
short story writer and critic, who dealt with the theme of illusion and
reality in many variations. After the end of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Schnitzler lost the cultural background of his work. Several of
Schnitzler's plays and other writings about the decadent mood of fin de
siècle Vienna have found their way onto the screen. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong><font size="2">SOLDIER: There isn't a soul about, you know. </font><br>
<font size="2">PARLOURMAID: Let's go back where there are people. </font><br>

</strong><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">La Ronde</font></i><font size="2">, adapted by John Barton, from a translation by Sue Davis, 1982) </font></font></blockquote>
<p>Arthur Schnitzler was born in Vienna, the son of Professor Johann
Schnitzler, a distinguished Jewish throat specialist, and Louise
Markbreiter, a doctor's daughter. Schnitzler's brother Julius became a
surgeon and his sister Gisela married a rhinologist. At the age of 16,
Schnitzler visited a prostitute and when his father found out, he
showed his son an illustrated treatise on sexually transmitted
diseases. </p><p>Schnitzler started writing as a boy, with poetry that
was published in a prominent newspaper. He also became a competent
amateur pianist. Although his father disapproved of his literary
aspirations, Schnitzler held him in high esteem; the title character of
his comedy<em> Professor Bernhardi</em> (1912), about old and new in
the medical profession, is supposedly modelled on him. The play was
suppressed until 1918 and caused outrage amongst anti-semites because
of its portrayal of a Jew, who refuses to compromise his convictions.
However, Schiltzer portrayed Bernardi as an unwilling martyr. </p>
<p><font face="Symbol"></font>Following in the footsteps of his father,
Schnitzler qualified for his own surprise in medicine at the University
of Vienna in 1895 <font face="Symbol">-</font> he had spent more time
with his plays and other writings than with his studies. At the same
time Schnitzler had developed a keen interest in psychiatry. In the
early 1890s,&nbsp;Schnitzler had started to write plays, which were
first presented, in Czech, in Prague. After the death of his father in
1893, Schnitzler gave up his hospital post and kept only a few private
patients. With<em> Liebelei</em>, produced at the Burgtheater in 1895, Schnitzler became famous all over Austria and Germany. </p><p>The
year after his father's death, Schnitzler himself had experiences
auditory hallucinations. He also suffered from tinnitus.
Schnitzler's&nbsp;close acquaintance with Sigmund Freud, who was a few
years older, led him to write a thesis on the hypnotic treatment of
neuroses. Freud's envy of&nbsp;his apparently effortless insights into
the workings of the mind is well known. On Schnitzler's sixtieth
birthday, Freud send him a letter, in which he wrote: "Your determinism
as well as your scepticism&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> what people call pessimism&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font>
your preoccupation with the truth of the unconscious and of the
instinctual drives in man, your dissection of the cultural conventions
of our society, the dwelling of your thoughts on the polarity of love
and death; all this moves me with an uncanny feeling of familiarity." </p>
<p>Like other Viennese writers, artists, musicians, and intellectuals,
Schnitzler spent hours talking with his friends in the unique world
coffeehouses, enjoying at the same time a cup of coffee and perhaps a
strudel. All epoch-making people knew each other. In Café Griensteidl
Schnitzler met <a href="hugohof.htm">Hugo von Hofmannstahl</a> and
other colleagues, and sometimes traded mistresses. Theodor Herzl, the
founder of political Zionism, appeared later in the character of Leo
Gowolsky in Schnitzler's autobiographical novel <i>The Road to the Open</i>,
in which Georg, a gifted composer, begins a love affair with a singing
teacher, Anna Rosner, and makes her pregnant. Georg, who could be seen
as a portrait of the author himself, avoids commitments. Anna accepts
his decision calmly <font face="Symbol">-</font> but perhaps this is not what happened in real life. </p>
<p>Schnitzler's early literary reputation was largely gained through his plays, 
starting from <em>Anatol</em> (1893), about the "sexual neurasthenia" of a young man. His work, which was daring for his time, 
 shows deep understanding of the unconscious and the subconscious <font face="Symbol">-</font> he has often been classified as the 
creative equivalent of his friend Sigmund Freud, who admitted that he recognized his "double" in the author.&nbsp; </p><p>In
his diary Schnitzler once recorded, that one of his girlfriends,
Jeannette, had eight orgasms a night, usually about fifty a month. He
had a relationship with his patient, Marie Glümer, and a stormy affair
with the actress Adele Sandrock, who played the leading lady in his
drama<em> Das Märchen</em> (prod. 1893). Although Schnitzler himself
had a variety of mistresses, his experiences with Marie Reinhard
between 1894 and 1899 influenced his writing most extensively.
After&nbsp;Marie's death, he visited her grave every year. With Olga
Gussmann, a 21-year old actress and singer, whom he married in 1903, he
had two children, Heinrich and Lili. Feeling herself neglected, Olga
began an affair with&nbsp;a pianist. The marriage was officially
dissolved in 1921. </p><p>Schnitzler's stories of sexual intrigue and portrayals of women were well received by a 
faithful circle of readers. The story<em> Casanovas Heimfahrt</em> (1918, Casanova's Homecoming) and the comedy <em>Die Schwestern; oder, Casanova in Spa</em> (1919, The Sisters, or, Casanova in Spa) portrayed <a href="casanova.htm">Giacomo Casanova</a> and his conquests.<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>In<span style="font-style: italic;"> Casanova's Homecoming </span>the
aged lover feels nothing but disgust for himself, the women with whom
he has sex, his male friends, and the church and its representatives.
The novel was translated from German by Eden and Cedar Paul, and
published in 1922 by Thomas Seltzer. Armed with a warrant, John Summer
and other members of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice
seized more than 800 copies of the book on their raid on the
publisher's offices. When the case went to court, witnesses for the
defense included the literary critic Carl Van Doren, psychiatrist
Adolph Stern, and magazine editors Gilbert Seldes and Dorothea Brand.
All charges against Seltzer were dismissed.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><em></em></p>
      <p><em>Reigen</em>&nbsp;(1900, Hands Around, also known as La
Ronde) is among Schnitzler's best-known dramas. It is a skilfully
constructed play in ten dialogues, in which the characters are seen
after coitus as well as before <font face="Symbol">-</font> love
making is marked by asterisks in the written text. Beginning with the
seduction of a Soldier by a Prostitute, each subsequent dialogue is
related to its predecessor to form a cycle. The character number ten,
the Count, makes love to the Prostitute, and closes the circle.
Schnitzler's work caused one of the greatest scandals in the history of
the German theatre and provoked anti-semitic riots in Berlin. A six-day
obscenity trial resulted in an acquittal, but the author banned any
performances of the play in Europe until after his death. </p>
<p><i>Hands Around </i>was not performed until 1920. The light-heartedly juxtaposed love-and-death theme inspired Max Ophuls's film <i>La Ronde</i> (1950). It was the second time the director had adapted a play by Schnitzler, the first being<i> Liebelei</i>
(1931). Ophuls used in the film a "master of ceremonies", played by
Anton Walbrook, who keeps La Ronde "moving" and directly addresses the
audience. Ophuls refuses to judge his characters, he leaves this solely
to the spectators. </p>
<p>Schnitzler's fiction is considered more important than his plays. In <em>Sterben </em>(1895),
depicting a dying man, he gave an example of an early
"stream-of-consciousness" technique, which he used systematically in <em>Leutnant Gustl</em> (1900), anticipating Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>. This work was considered an insult to the whole Army and is thought to have cost Schnitzler his officer's rank <font face="Symbol"></font><font face="Symbol">-</font>
Schnitzler was removed from the reserve list of the Austrian Medical
Corps. "No writer has ever received so much abuse in the course of his
career as I have," Schnitzler complained in his diary. The protagonist
of the story is a poor young officer is unable to satisfy his "honor"
after he has been insulted by another man, a master baker. Gustl's
suicidal thoughts are told through the interior monologue.<em>&nbsp;Der Weg ins Freie</em>&nbsp;(1908,
The Road to the Open) depicts a composer, who has real gifts but lacks
drive. Central themes in this work are anti-Semitism and the ending of
a romantic relationship.<em> Fräulein Else</em> (1926), one of
Schnitzler's most&nbsp;popular books,&nbsp;is a monologue of a
nineteen-year-old girl forced to show herself in the nude to his
father's friend because of her family's debts. Her thought reveal what
she dare not say. Living up to a daughter's duty, she yields to this
demand but then commits suicide. </p>
<p><em>Traumnovelle </em>(1926, Rhapsody: A Dream Novel) was adapted
for the screen by Stanley Kubrick in 1999. "Overlong, and flawed, but
still compelling, with two megawatt star performances," wrote Leonard
Maltin in his <i>Movie &amp; Video Guide </i>(2000). "Nudity is plentiful, but the European version is even more graphic."<font size="2"> </font>Schnitzler
makes a parallel between sexual fantasies and real life. Doctor
Fridolin's wife Albertine reveals to him one morning her dream, in
which secret sexual desires come into the light. Fridolin finds the
confession disturbing. He visits a house where he nearly participates
in orgies, but is then forced by two men to leave the place. Now it is
Fridolin's turn to reveal his adventure or dream to Albertine. He
starts to understand his wife from a new basis. The end of the novel is
open both to the renewal and the break-up of the marriage. </p>
<p>Most of Schnitzler's later years, spent in a luxurious villa
overlooking Vienna, were devoted almost entirely to writing. After the
Hapsburg monarchy had collapsed, Schnitzler shifted from playwriting to
fiction. His social-political criticism was veiled, and once he said:
"Martyrdom has always been a proof of the intensity, never of the
correctness of a belief." The death of his daughter, Lili Schnitzler
Cappellini,&nbsp;in 1930 at the age of eighteen, was a great shock to
the author and he never fully recovered from it. While on vacation in
Venice she had fallen in love with&nbsp;a Fascist military officer,
twenty years her senior.&nbsp;They married when she was seventeen and a
year later she committed suicide.&nbsp;It has been told, that on
his&nbsp;way home from her funeral&nbsp;Schnitzler saw a woman reading
his&nbsp;book,&nbsp;<em>Fräulein Else</em>. </p><p>Schnitzler died on
October 21, 1931, in Vienna. His works were banned by the Nazi party in
Germany, and also in Austria. In 1933, when Joseph Goebbels organized
book burnings in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler's works were
thrown into flames along with those of other Jews <font face="Symbol">-</font> Einstein, Marx, Kafka, Freud, and Stefan Zweig.</p>
