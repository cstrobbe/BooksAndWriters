<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English bank official, the author of
<i>The Wind in the Willows</i> (1908). This Edwardian classic, set in
the idyllic English countryside, established Grahame's international
reputation as a writer of children's books and has deeply influenced
fantasy literature. Its central characters are the shy little Mole,
clever Ratty, Badger, and crazy, energetic Toad. They all converse and
behave like humans, but have at the same time typical animal habits.
Some animals are eaten for breakfast. Grahame also published essays,
stories, and collections
of sketches. Grahame's personal life was not as happy as the fictional
world he created. It has been questioned whether this novel is a
children's book at all. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wild
World," said the Rat. "And that's something that doesn't matter, either
to you or me. I've never been there, and I'm never going, nor you
either, if you've got any sense at all..."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Wind in the Willows</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Kenneth Grahame was born in Edinburgh, the third of four children.
His father, James Cunningham Grahame, was a lawyer from an old Scottish
family, and mother Bessie (Ingles) Grahame, the daughter of John Ingles
of Hilton, Lasswade. In the early years, he lived with his family in
the Western Highlands, near Loch Fyne. Grahame's mother died of scarlet
fever when he was five. Due to the alcoholism of his father, who
resigned his post as Sheriff-Substitute of Argyllshire and died of
drink in Le Havre, Grahame was brought up by elderly relatives. He was
sent with his sister to live with their maternal grandmother in the
village of Cookham Dene, Berkshire. Her house and its large garden by
the River Thames provided the background of <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As a rule, indeed, grown-up people are
fairly correct on matters of fact; it is in the higher gift of
imagination that they are so sadly to seek." </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">The Golden Age</font></i><font size="2">, 1985) </font></blockquote>
<p>Grahame was educated at St. Edward's School, Oxford. His desire for
further education at Oxford University was thwarted by his stingy
uncle, John Grahame, who was acting as his guardian. Between 1875 and
1879 he worked as a clerk for his uncle in a parliamentary agent's
office and in 1879 he entered the Bank Of England. While pursuing his
career, Grahame began composing light nonfiction pieces as a pastime.
He contributed articles to such journals as the <i>St. James Gazette,</i> W.E. Henley's <i>National Observer</i>, and <i>The Yellow Book</i>.   In 1898 he was appointed to the post of Secretary to the Bank.  </p>
<p>Grahame's early essays and stories, collected in <i>Pagan Papers</i> (1893), were praised by Swinburne.<i> The Golden Age</i> (1895), a collection of sketches, was said to be the favorite bedtime reading of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Its sequel <i>Dream Days</i>
(1898) included Grahame's most famous short story, 'The Reluctant
Dragon'. The Dragon, a lazy, poetry-loving Bohemian, wants to be left
alone, but the villagers want it dead. Thanks to a wise young boy, the
peaceful monster manages to keep its life. St. George, supposed to be
thirsting for its blood, doesn't want to hurt it. The Saint and the
Dragon give a good performance, "a jolly fight", and the Dragon
collapses as they had agreed beforehand. After refreshment St. George
makes a speech and warns "them against the sin of romancing, and making
up stories and fancying other people would believe them just because
they were plausible and highly-coloured."</p>

<p>In 1899 Grahame married Elspeth Thomson, a 36-year-old spinster, but did not give up his bachelor ways.  Soon after 
her wedding Elspeth Grahame wrote to Emma Hardy, asking her for any advice on being married to a writer. The reply was 
that "I can scarcely think that love proper and enduring is in the nature of men . . .  There is ever a desire to give 
but little in return for our devotion and affection <font face="Symbol">-</font>  theirs being akin to 
children's . . ." Grahame wrote parts of  <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>
in a letter form to his young son Alistair, nicknamed Mouse, who was
born blind in one eye and with severe squint in the other. Originally
Grahame did not intend to publish the stories; they were partly
educational for his son, whose behavior had similarities with the
reckless and selfish Toad, who nevertheless wins the sympathy of the
reader. When Alastair was away from home, he continued the Toad stories
in letters to his son. Grahame's manuscript was rejected by The Bodley
Head, the publisher of his earlier books, and an American periodical,
but eventually the book was published by Methuen in 1908 in England.
First it was received with mild enthusiasm, but E.H. Shephard's
illustration and Grahame's animal characterizations started soon gain
fame. A copy of the Methuen edition was sent to President Theodore
Roosevelt, who said that Wind was "such a beautiful thing that Scribner
<i>must</i> publish it." In 1929 <a href="aamilne.htm">A.A. Milne</a> dramatized 
the  story as <i>Toad of Toad Hall. </i>Milne focused on the animals, cutting out most of Grahame's romantic fantasy. </p>
<p><i>The Wind in the Willows </i>reflected the author's  unhappiness with the real world  <font face="Symbol">-</font>
his idyllic riverbank woods and fields were ''clean of the clash of
sex,'' as he said to Theodore Roosevelt. The main tale tells about Mr.
Toad's obsession with motorcars.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"'Glorious,
stirring sight!' murmured Toad, never offering to move. 'The poetry of
motion! The REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel! Here to-day--in
next week to-morrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities jumped--always
somebody else's horizon! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my! O my!'" Mr. Toad's
motoring leads him into imprisonment. Meanwhile Toad Hall is invaded by
stoats and weasels. Toad escapes dressed as a washerwoman. He sells a
horse to a gypsy and returns into the Wild Wood. With the help of his
companions, Toad recaptures his ancestral home. "The superficial scheme
of the story is so childishly naive, or so daringly naive, that only a
genius could have preserved it from the ridiculous," said Arnold
Bennett in his review of the book in 1908. "The book is an urbane
exercise in irony at the expense of the English character and of
mankind. It is entirely successful." </p>
<p>Grahame retired from his work in 1908, officially because of health
reasons, but perhaps also under pressure from his employees. His son
Alastair, who appears to have been psychologically disturbed, committed
suicide while an undergraduate at Oxford, by laying on train tracks at
Oxford, two days before his 20th birthday. Grahame stopped writing
after WW I. He died in Pangborne, Berkshire, on July 6, 1932. William
Horwood's sequel <i>The Willows in the Winter</i> (1993), which followed Grahame's lyrical prose and phraseology,  received mixed reviews. <i>Toad Triumphant</i>, the second sequel, <i></i>came out in 1996. The trilogy was finished with <i>The Willows and Beyond</i> (1998). Horwood has also written  the internationally acclaimed Duncton trilogies. </p>
