<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author, short story
writer, essayist, poet, travel book writer, biographer, and columnist.
Irving has been called the father of the American short story. He is
best known for 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' in which the schoolmaster
Ichabold Crane meets with a headless horseman, and 'Rip Van Winkle,'
about a man who falls asleep for 20 years. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am always at a loss to know how much to believe of my own stories."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Tales of a Traveler</font></i><font size="2">, 1824) </font></blockquote>

<p>Washington Irving was born in New York City, the youngest of 11
children. "The house in which I was born," he recalled later, "was No.
131 William-street, about half-way between John and Fulton streets.
Within a very few weeks after my birth the family moved into a house
nearly opposite, which my father had recently purhased; it was No. 128.
. . ." His father, William Irving, was a wealthy merchant, born in the
Orkney Islands. Sarah (née Sanders), his mother, was the granddaughter
of an English&nbsp;clergyman. According to a story, George Washington
met Irving in 1789 in a shop, and gave his blessing on his namesake.
Irving never forgot the moment. In the years to come&nbsp;he would
write one of his greatest works, <em>The Life of George Washington</em> (1855-59). </p>
<p>Early in his life Irving developed a passion for books. He read <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, <i>Sinbad the Sailor</i>, and <i>The World Displayed; or, A Curious Cllection of Voyages and Travels</i>.
He studied law privately in the offices of Henry Masterton (1798),
Brockholst Livingston (1801), and John Ogde Hoffman (1802), but
practiced only briefly. From 1804 to 1806 he traveled widely around
Europe, where he visited Marseilles and Genoa, saw the famous English
naval officer, Nelson, in Sicily, and met Washington Allston, the
painter, in Rome. After returning to the United States, Irving was
admitted to New York bar in 1806. He was a partner with his brothers in
the family hardware business in New York and Liverpool, England, and a
representative of the business in England until it collapsed in 1818.
During the war of 1812 Irving&nbsp;served as&nbsp;a military aide to
New York Governor Tompkins in the U.S. Army. </p>

<p>Irving's career as a writer started in journals and newspapers. He 
contributed to <i>Morning Chronicle</i> (1802-03), which was edited by his brother Peter, and published <i>Salmagundi</i> (1807-08), writing in collaboration with his brother William and James Kirke Paulding. From 1812 to 1814 he was an editor of <i>Analectic</i> magazine in Philadelphia and New York.</p>
<p>Irving's success in social life and literature was shadowed by a
personal tragedy. He was engaged to be married to Matilda Hoffman, who
died at the age of seventeen, in 1809. Later he wrote in a private
letter, addressed to Mrs. Forster, as an answer to her inquiry why he
had not been married: "For years I could not talk on the subject of
this hopeless regret; I could not even mention her name; but her image
was continually before me, and I dreamt of her incessantly." <span class="st"><span class="ft">However, it has also been claimed that&nbsp;Irving was a homosexual. </span></span></p>

<p>Irving's comic history of the Dutch regime in New York, <em>A History of New York</em>
(1809), was published under the name&nbsp;of the imaginary 'Dietrich
Knickerbocker', who was supposed to be an eccentric Dutch-American
scholar. It was one of the earliest fantasies of history. The name
Knickerbocker was later used to identify the first American school of
writers, the <i>Knickerbocker Group</i>, of which Irving was a leading
figure. The book became part of New York folklore, and eventually the
word Knickerbocker was also used to describe any New Yorker who could
trace one's family to the original Dutch settlers. Irving's success
continued with <em>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. </em>(1819-20),
a collection of stories, which allowed him to become a full-time
writer. The stories were heavily influenced by the German folktales. In
<em>Bracebridge Hall</em> (1822), the sequel of <i>The Sketch Book</i>,&nbsp;Irving
invites the reader to ramble gently with him at the Hall, stating that
"I am not writing a novel, and have nothing of intricate plot, or
marvelous adventure, to promise the reader." </p>

<p>After the death of his mother, Irving decided to stay in Europe,
where he remained for seventeen years, from 1815 to 1832. He lived in
Dresden (1822-23), London (1824) and Paris (1825). In England Irving
had a romantic liaison with Mary Shelley. Eventually he settled in
Spain,&nbsp;working there&nbsp;for financial reasons for the U.S.
Embassy in Madrid (1826-29). In 1829-32 Irving was a secretary to the
American Legation under Martin Van Buren. During his stay in Spain, he
wrote<em> Columbus </em>(1828), <em>Conquest of Granada </em>(1829), and <em>The Companions of Columbus </em>(1831), all based on careful historical research. In 1829 he moved to London and published&nbsp; <em>Alhambra</em> (1832), concerning the history and the legends of Moorish Spain. Among his literary friends were <a href="mshelley.htm">Mary Shelley </a>and <a href="long.htm">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. </p>

<p>In 1832 Irving returned to New York to an enthusiastic welcome as
the first American author to have achieved international fame. He
toured the southern and western United States and wrote <em>The Cayon Miscellany </em>(1835) and <em>A Tour on the Prairies </em>(1835),
an account of a journey, which extended from Fort Gibson, at that time
a frontier post of the Far West, to the Cross Timbers in what is now
Oklahoma. His fellow-travelers included Henry Leavitt Ellsworth
(1791-1858), who also wrote an interesting narrative of the tour, and
Charles Joseph Latrobe (1801-1875), whom Irving described as a "man of
a thousand occupations; a botanist, a geologist, a hunter of beetles
and butterflies, a musical amateur, a sketcher of no mean pretensions,
in short, a complete virtuoso." </p>
<p>From 1836 to 1842 Irving lived at Sunnyside manor house,
Tarrytown-on-Hudson. When his old friend, Charles Dickens, visited
America, he saw also Irving and celebrated their reunion with a speech:
"There is in this city a gentleman who, at the reception of one of my
books&#8212;I well remember it was the Old Curiosity Shop&#8212;wrote to me in
England a letter so generous, so affectionate, and so manly, that if I
had written the book under every circumstance of disappointment, of
discouragement, and difficulty, instead of the reverse, I should have
found in the receipt of that letter my best and most happy reward. I
answered him, and he answered me, and so we kept shaking hands
autographically, as if no ocean rolled between us. I came here to this
city eager to see him, and [laying his hand upon Irving&#8217;s shoulder]
here he sits! I need not tell you how happy and delighted I am to see
him here to-night in this capacity." </p><p>After working for three months on the <i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i>,
Irving found out that the famous historian William Prescott had decided
to write a book on the same subject and abandoned his theme, "to be
treated by one who will built up from it an enduring monument in the
literature of our country." Between the years 1842-45
Irving&nbsp;served as&nbsp;U.S. Ambassador in Spain. The appointment
was sponsored by Daniel Webster, the Secretary of State. At the age of
sixty-two Irving wrote to his friends in America: "My heart yearns for
home; and I have now probably turned the last corner in life, and my
remaining years are growing scanty in number, I begrudge every one that
I am obliged to pass separated from my cottage and my kindred...."</p>

<p>Irving spent the last years of his life in Tarrytown.&nbsp;<span class="ft">In
spite of his success,&nbsp;money remained a constant worry and his
family members lost much of his earnings in poor investments.
Moreover,&nbsp;Irving suffered from writers block and battled a
herpetic condition that periodically laid him up for months. </span>From 1848 to 1859 he was President of Astor Library, later New York Public Library. Irving's later publications include&nbsp;<em>Mahomet and His Successors</em>&nbsp;(1850), a careful presentation of the life, beliefs, and character of Mohammed,<em> Wolfert's Roost&nbsp;</em> (1855), and his five-volume <i>The Life of George Washington</i>.
Irving died in Tarrytown on November 28, 1859. Just before retiring for
the night, the author had said: "Well, I must arrange my pillows for
another weary night! If this could only end!" Irving's major works were published in 1860-61 in 21 volumes.</p>

<p>Irving was the first American to earn a living by his pen. For six
decades, he churned out books, and reviews, letters,&nbsp;and essays
for newspapers. As an essayist Irving was not interested in the meaning
of nature like Emerson or self-inspection like Montaigne. He observed
the vanishing pasts of old Europe, the riverside Creole villages of
Louisiana, the old Pawnee hunting grounds of Oklahoma, and how ladies
fashion moves from one extreme to the other. 'Geoffrey Crayon' was his
most prolific fictional mask. Irving once said: "There rise authors now
and then, who seem proof against the mutability of language, because
they have rooted themselves in the unchanging principles of human
nature."<font size="2"> </font></p><p><font size="3">Irving's best-known story, 'Rip Van Winkle,' was included in <i>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. </i>It was based on a German folktale, set in the Dutch culture of Pre-Revolutionary War in New York State. </font>Rip
Van Winkle is a farmer who wanders into the Catskill Mountains. He
meets there a group of dwarfs playing nine-pins. Rip helps a dwarf and
is rewarded with a draught of liquor. He falls into an enchanted sleep.
When he awakens, 20 years later, the world has changed. He is an old
man with a long, white beard. Rip goes into town and finds everything
changed. His wife is dead, his children are grown. The old man
entertains the people with tales of the old days and his encounter with
the dwarfs. The theme of Irving's story derives from Diogenes Laertius,
<i>Epimenides</i> (c. 200), in which Epimenides is sent by his father
into the field to look for a sheep; he lies down in a cave and sleeps
fifty-seven years. When awake, he goes on looking for the sheep,
thinking that he had been taking a short snap. </p>
<p>Irving also used other German folktales in his short stories, among them <i>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i>.
"The headless horseman was often seen here. An old man who did not
believe in ghosts told of meeting the headless horseman coming from his
trip into the Hollow. The horseman made him climb up behind. They rode
over bushes, hills, and swamps. When they reached the bridge, the
horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton. He threw the old man into the
brook and sprang away over the treetops with a clap of thunder."<font size="2"><strong> </strong></font></p><p><font size="3"><em>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</em>
was probably based on a story by Karl Musäus (1735-1787), a German
academic writer, who was among the first to collect local folktales.
This story popularized the image of the headless horseman, and formed
the basis for an operetta by Douglas Moore, <i>The Headless Horseman,</i> with libretto by </font><a href="sbenet.htm">Stephen Vincent Benét</a>. The tale was filmed as the second half of Disney's animated movie <i>The Adventures of Ichabold and Mr Toad </i>(1949).
Tim Burton's&nbsp;screen&nbsp;adaptation from 1999&nbsp;partly changed
the plot. The film&nbsp;bears&nbsp;the airless quality typical for the
director. Ichabold Crane, the protagonist,&nbsp;is a constable from New
York, not a schoolteacher. He believes in rational methods of
detection, and is sent to the farming community called Sleepy Hollow in
upstate New York to investigate three recent murders. The townspeople
know who the culprit is: a long-dead Hessian mercenary nicknamed the
Headless Horseman who was killed during the Revolutionary War and
buried in the Western Woods.</p>
