<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->UK writer, one of the grand
masters of science fiction with <a href="asimov.htm">Isaac Asimov </a>and
<a href="heinlein.htm">Robert A. Heinlein</a>. Apart from his literary endeavours, however, Arthur C. Clarke is 
remembered as the inventor of communication satellite, an idea he first expounded in a 1945 
article entitled 'Extraterrestial Relays.' Clarke's professional writing career spanned over five decades. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"></font><font color="White" size="2">-</font><font size="2"><b>"Behind
every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for that is the ratio by which
the dead outnumber the living. Since the dawn of time, roughly a
hundred billion human beings have walked the planet Earth. </b></font><b><br>
<font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">Now this is an
interesting number, for by a curious coincidence there are
approximately a hundred billion stars in our local universe, the Milky
Way. So for every man who has ever lived, in this universe, there
shines a star."</font></b><font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">2001, A Space Odyssey</font></i><font size="2">, 1968) </font></blockquote>

<p>Arthur C. Clarke was born at the coast town of Minehead, the eldest
of four children. His father, Charles Wright Clarke, was a Post Office engineer turned into a farmer; he
died in 1931. Left with
her children, Clarke's mother continued to run the farm. To augment the family income, she
gave riding lessons, bred Cairn terriers, and took paying guests.
"Though she must always have been short of money, I do not recall any
real hardship," Clarke recalled in&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Astounding Days</span> (1989).<br>
 </p>
<p>Clarke became interested in science in early age, devouring books by H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, Rider Haggard, and others. He was also an avid reader
of <i>Astounding Stories</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Magnet, Boy's Own Paper</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Meccano Magazine</span>. His
primary source of books was the Taunton Public Library, which he
visited almost daily. From the Minehead Public Library he borrowed W.
Olaf Stapledon's <span style="font-style: italic;">Last and First Men</span>; "no book before or since has had such an impact on my imagination," Clarke once said. While at Huish's
Grammar School, Clarke started to write stories which were
published in school magazines and fan magazines. After doing homework, he built transmitters and
chrystal radio sets. At
thirteen, Clarke constructed his first telescope. </p>

<p>On leaving school Clarke took the entrance examination for the Civil
Service Executive Grade, scoring 100% in arithmetic. From the summer of
1936, he worked in the Exchequer and Audit
Department in London, where his job involved auditing teacher pensions.
Clarke's apartment became the meeting place of the British
Interplanetary Society, which he had joined when he was sixteen, and in
1949 he was appointed chairman of the BIS. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1941, Clarke joined the Royal Air Force, specializing in radar and eventually
rising to the rank of flight-lieutenant. During the service Clarke sold
his first science-fiction story to John W. Campbell, editor of <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>. In 1945 he wrote a technical paper  that was the forerunner of communication satellites. The essay war reprinted in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ascent to Orbit</span>,
a collection of his technical writings, that he brought out after
receiving the Marconi Award in 1982 for his contributions to
communications technology. A short paper, 'Stationary Orbits,' was published in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Journal of the British Astronomical Association</span> in December 1947. Clarke's non-science fiction novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Glide Path</span> (1963) was based on a testing program for the first blind approach radar.</p>

<p>After the war Clarke entered King's College, London, and took two
years later his B.Sc. with honours in physics and mathematics in 1948.
His first published novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Prelude to Space,</span>
was written in three weeks during the summer of 1947. Some of his early
stories Clarke wrote under the pseudonym Charles Willis, once he used
the name E.G. O'Brien. From 1949 to 1951 he was an assistant editor of <i>Physics Abstracts</i>.
The drawings of R.A. Smith, who was a member of the British
Interplanetary Society, contributed greatly to Clarke's early books, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Exploration of Space</span> (1951) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Exploration of the Moon</span> (1954). Since 1952 Clarke worked as a full-time writer. </p>
<p>In the 1950s Clarke became interested in undersea exploration. He
settled in 1956 permanently in Sri Lanka, where he wrote several
fiction and nonfiction books and articles about the Indian Ocean.
With his friend Mike Wilson he filmed the Great Barrier Reef of
Australia, from which his novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Deep Range</span>
(1957) derives. Clarke also served as a director of Rocket Publishing,
London, Underwater Safaris, Colombo, and Spaceward Corporation, New
York. During his career, Clarke witnessed the development of all the
major space programs, from Sputnik and Apollo to Voyager. Fortunate to
see his visions turn into reality, he also appeared as commentator on
CBS TV for the Apollo 11, 12 and 15 Moon missions. </p>
<p>Due to a severe attack of polio in 1962, Clarke became completely paralyzed.  As his farewell to the sea he wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">Dolphin Island</span>.
After recovering Clarke started his cooperation with the director
Stanley Kubrick. Later he accompanied his friend Mike Wilson on an
underwater adventure six miles off the coast of Sri Lanka, which was
depicted in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Treasure of the Great Reef&nbsp;</span>
(1964). However, Clarke still spent over six months out of his beloved
island because of tax laws. His home was was surrounded by a high wall
and an electric fence. In 1975 the Indian government presented him with
a satellite dish, with which he was able to receive programs broadcast
from experimental satellite ATS6. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The island of Ceylon is a small
universe; it contains as many variations of culture, scenery, and
climate as some countries a dozen times its size. What you get from it
depends on what you bring; if you never stray from your hotel bar or
the dusty streets of westernized Colombo, you could perish of
fulminating boredom in a week, and it would serve you right. But if you
are interested in people, history, nature, and art - the things that </b></font><b><i><font size="2">really </font></i><font size="2">matter - you may find, as I have, that a lifetime is not enough."</font></b><font size="2"> (Clarke in <i>The View from Serendip</i>, 1977) </font></blockquote>
<p>In the 1980s Clarke was a presenter of the television series <i>Arthur C. Clarke's 
Mysterious World </i>(1980) and<i> World of Strange Powers</i> (1985). He  lectured widely 
in Britain and in the United States. In 1980 he was Vikram Sarabhai Professor at Physical 
Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India. Until 1982 Clarke had written his books with a 
typewriter, but after the arrival of his first computer &#8211; 5 MB of memory &#8211; he used only 
his word processor. </p>
<p>Clarke's best known works include the short story <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sentinel</span>
(1951), about man's contact with sentient life. In the spring of 1964,
Clarke retired to Hotel Chelsea in New York and began to write a novel
about a space travel. His illustrious acquaintances during this period
included Arhur Miller, Andy Warhol, Allen Ginsberg, and Norman Mailer.
Clarke's story was the basis of the novel and film <span style="font-style: italic;">2001: A Space Odyssey</span> (1968), for which Clarke wrote the script with Stanley Kubrick.  The novel was based on the original screenplay. </p>
<p>In <i>2001</i> a mysterious monolith is found buried beneath the
surface of the moon. It send's a signal towards Jupiter. To solve the
mystery astronauts are sent to Jupiter with the help of the
"infallible" super-computer HAL 9000, voiced in the film by the
Canadian actor Douglas Rain. With the amazing machine Clarke presents
one of the basic philosophical questions: can there be intelligence
without consciousness? After a series of accidents and HAL's
operations, one of the astronauts, David Bowman, is left alone as the
ship reaches the planet. There he embarks on the final step in
humankind's next developmental stage and at the end, as a fetus,
symbolizes the birth of the Übermensch. "If anyone understands it on
the first viewing, we've failed in our intention", Clarke said of the
film. Clarke continued the <i>Odyssey</i><i> Saga </i>in three sequels,<span style="font-style: italic;"> 2010: Odyssey Two</span> (1982), <span style="font-style: italic;">2061: Odyssey Three</span> (1988), and <span style="font-style: italic;">3001: The Final Odyssey</span> (1996).</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Childhood's End</span> (1953) told about the beginning of the age of Humankind after Overlods have 
eliminated ignorance, disease and poverty. <span style="font-style: italic;">A Fall of Moondust</span> (1961) was a tale of marooned moon schooner, 
and in <span style="font-style: italic;">Rendezvous with Rama</span> (1973) a research team is sent to investigate a cylindrical 
object hurtling through the solar system. Although Clarke announced that <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fountains of Paradise&nbsp;</span>
(1979) would be his last work of fiction, he continued his literary
activity. With Gentry Lee, the chief engineer on Project Galileo,
Clarke wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">Cradle</span> (1988), originally conceived as a movie project, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Rama II</span> (1989). Clarke's catastrophe novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hammer of God </span>(1993) about an asteroid hurtling toward Earth, anticipated such films as Deep <i>Impact</i> (1998) and <i>Armageddon </i>(1998). Clarke's <i>Venus Prime</i> series was franchised to Paul Preuss. </p>

<p>The Kubrick/Clarke vision from 1968 of computers and space programs
at the turn of the century did not came true. In an interview Clarke
acknowledged:<b> </b>"We science-fiction writers never attempt to
predict. In fact, it's the exact opposite. As my friend Ray Bradbury
said, 'We do this not to predict the future but to prevent it.'"<font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Newsweek</font></i><font size="2">, December 2000-February 2001, special edition)</font></p>

<p>Clarke was fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and recipient of
many awards for his science fiction. He was the guest of honour at the
1956 World Science Fiction Convention, when he won a Hugo for his story
'The Star.' <i>Rendezvous with Rama </i>won the Nebula and Hugo
Awards, and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award. Clarke also received
the Franklin Gold Medal, and in 1962 the UNESCO-Kalinga Prize for
popularizing science. Clarke was made a knight in 1998. </p>
<p>In 1954 he married Marilyn Mayfield, a 22-year-old American, whom he
had met on a trip to Florida; they separated after a few months and
divorced officially in 1964. A British tabloid, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sunday Mirror</span>,
claimed in 1998 that he had paid young boys for sex. After an
investigation by the Sri Lankan police and Interpol, Clarke was cleared
of accusations; he did not sue the newspaper. For the last two decades
of his life, Clarke suffered from post-polio syndrome. Clarke died in
Colombo, Sri Lanka, on March 19, 2008. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Nevertheless, it is vital to remember
that information &#8211; in the sense of raw data &#8211; is not knowledge; that
knowledge is not wisdom; and that wisdom is not foresight. But
information is the first essential step to all of these."</b> (in 'Is There Life After Television' in </font><i><font size="2">Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!</font></i><font size="2">, 1999) </font></blockquote>
<p>A  central theme in Clarke's fiction was the "spiritual" rebirth and the search for man's place in the universe. In <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> the discussions of a research team form an allegory for the great question of the meaning of life. <i>2001</i>
traces the evolution of man and humanity's quest for existential
answers, symbolized by the unearthly monolith. In the sequels
technological progress allows to reveal some of the secrets behind the
monolith. </p>
<p>  "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic",  
Clarke once said. The technological details of his books were flawless, and often  Clarke 
guessed right  new advances in science, but not always. In an article from 1999, 'The 
Twentieth-First Century: A (Very) Brief History,' he predicted that the last coal mine 
is closed in 2006, a city in a third world country is devastated in 2009 by the accidental 
explosion of an A-bomb in its armory, and in 2014 starts the construction of Hilton Orbiter 
Hotel. A step forwaard with the idea of a space elevator, as dramatized in <i>The Fountains of Paradise</i>, 
was taken up in the early 2000s. NASA's Institute for Advaced Concepts program funded  
Bradley C. Edwards' and Eric A. Wrestling's study <i>The Space Elevator</i> 
(Spaego, San Francisco, 2003). Colin McInnes and Chris Davis published in the 
<i>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</i> (vol. 59, 2006) a study of the 
use of space elevators as energy-free "orbital siphons".
