<p>German dramatist, poet, and short story writer, a forerunner of
expressionism and the theatre of the absurd. Wedekind's most famous
works include the two-part drama, <i>Der Erdgeist</i> (1895) and <i>Die Büchse der Pandora</i>
(1904), originally written as a whole. Its amoral central character,
the archetypal femme fatale Lulu, inspired George Pabst's expressionist
film <i>Pandora's Box</i> (1929), starring the Hollywood actress Louise Brooks, and Alban Berg's unfinished opera <i>Lulu</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Was schiert mich das Theater! Unsere kühne</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Tagtäglichkeit erreicht's bekanntlich nie.</font><br>
<font size="2">Das menschliche Gehirn sei meine Bühne,</font><br>
<font size="2">Mein Lieblingsregisseur die Phantasie.</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in <i>Die Büchse der Pandora</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>Benjamin Franklin Wedekind was born in Hanover, the second of the six children 
born to Friedrich Wilhelm Wedekind, a physician, and Emilie Kammerer, a German singer 
and actress. During the early period of his life, Wedekind's father had served as 
physician to the Sultan of Turkey. A fierce democrat, he participated in the 1848 Revolution, 
and next year escaped to America, where he made a fortune in land speculation. In San 
Francisco he married Emilie; she was twenty-three years his junior. Two years later he 
returned to Germany, but disgusted by Bismarck's nationalist policies, he eventually 
emigrated with his family to Switzerland. </p>
<p>Wedekind grew up in Lenzburg, where his father had purchased a castle.&nbsp;A 
disappointed veteran of the revolution at that time, he disagreed with his wife's more 
liberal views and had became isolated from the rest of the family.&nbsp; After having a serious clash 
with his father and&nbsp;actually striking him, 
Wedekind left home, assuming wrongly, that he would never be forgiven. 
In 1884 Wedekind entered the University of Lausanne, and then moved to the University of Munich. He 
studied law and literature, but abandoned his studies and took a job as a publicity 
agent for the Swiss soup company Maggi. 

<a href="hauptman.htm">Gerhart Hauptmann</a>, the leading dramatist of his generation, 
portrayed in <i>Friedensfest</i> (1890) the Wedekind family as full of hatred and 
mistrust, revealing some strictly confidental details. Wedekind replied with a short 
play, which satirized Hauptmann's naturalist school of drama. </p>
<p>In Zürich Wedekind befriended the Swedish 
playwright <a href="strindbe.htm">August Strindberg</a>.
With Strindberg's wife Frida Uhl (1872-1943) he had an affair and as
the result an illegitimate child in 1897. Their son, Friedrich
Strindberg, became a journalist. During WWII he helped a number of
Jews, who lived underground in Berlin. Wedekind's father died in 1888,
and left him a sizable inheritance. For a period Wedekind worked as a
secretary to a circus, the Herzog, before settling in Munich, his home
until his death. The influence of circus art is seen in Wedekind's
dramatic vision. </p>
<p>In Munich, the artistic and cultural centre of Germany around the
turn of the century, Wedekind led a bohemian life. He also visited
Paris and London, and in 1895 he traveled in Switzerland, where he gave
readings from Ibsen's plays under the pseudonym Cornelius Minehaha.
Wedekind's first full-length drama of importance, <i>Frühlings Erwachen</i>
(1891, Spring's Awakening) appeard in book form in Zürich before it was
produced by Max Reinhardt fifteen years later. It dealt with the theme
of adolescent sexuality and had the reputation of being far too obscene
to be performed. Although this poetic tragedy did not completely break
with naturalism, the last act in which one of the characters rises from
grave carrying his head under his arm, inviting the hero to join him in
death, demonstrated Wedekind's growing interest in grotesque and
fantastic. This work, in which the fourteen-year-old girl is killed by
abortion pills, created a scandal and marked the beginning of
Wedekind's many struggles with censorship and accusations of
pornography. The play had its first uncencored production in English in
1974.</p>
<p>Wedekind was a cofounder of the satirical journal <i>Simplicissimus</i>. Accused of <i>lèse majesté</i>
for an article in which he had&nbsp;ridiculed Kaiser Wilhelm II's
journey to Palestine, Wedekind fled abroad for a short period. Upon his
return to Germany, Wedekind was imprisoned for six months in the
fortress of Köningstein, where he wrote the story 'Minehaha'. <i>König Nicolo, oder So ist das Leben</i> (1911), was written in the aftermath of his prison sentence, but not produced until 1919. <i>Oaha, die Satire der Satire </i>(1908) was a comedy drawing on Wedekind's experiences with <i>Simplicissimus</i>.</p>
<p>During the carnival of 1901, Wedekind paraded with artists,
students, actors, and writers through the streets, denouncing the
censorship. Eleven of the demonstrators established a cabaret called
Die 11 Scarfrichter (the Eleven Executioners), where Wedekind performed
his own poems, accompanying himself on&nbsp;a lute. However, the star
of the cabaret was Marya Delvard. One of her popular songs, written by
Wedekind, was about a young girl, who concludes melancholically: "When
I no longer rouse desire, / Well, then I might as well be dead."
Cabaretistic elements became an integral part of his plays, which drew
on pantomime, circus, funfair, vaudeville, grand-guignol. Wedekind's
tragicomedies, in turn, had an influence on Expressionism, Dadaism,
Brecht, and the theatre of absurd. </p>
<p>Wedekind's central themes are moral hypocrisy and sexual freedom.
Like Freud, or later D.H. Lawrence in Britain, Wedekind saw that there
is a profound conflict between human sexuality and the pressures and
requirements of society. Thus he set out to liberate instincts from the
constraints of rational Self. In his later dramas Wedekind dealt with
suffering, religion, and ethical problems. These works have not enjoyed
similar appreciation as his Lulu cycle and <i>Der Marquis von Keith</i>
(1900), about a zestful opportunist, who pretends to be a a wealthy
marquis, and his tutelage, a young idealist. Wedekind himself acted in
his stage productions, and in this play he had the role of the
swindler. </p><p>Wedekind reworked the so-called Lulu plays, <em>Erdgeist</em>&nbsp;(Earth Spirit)&nbsp;and<em> Die Büchse der Pandora</em>&nbsp;(Pandora's Box), several times. Together they made up ein <em>Monstretragödie</em> (a monster tragedy). <em>Erdgeist </em>was
first produced in Leipzig in 1898, with Leonie Taliansky as Lulu and
Wedekind as Dr Schön, who rescued the young Lulu from street life. The
last two acts of the original <em>Lulu</em> play plus one new act was produced in 1905 under the title<em> Pandora's Box</em>.
On the stage Wedekind often collaborated with the actress Tilly Newes,
whom he married in 1906.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp; met him when she was
nineteen. They acted together in <em>Pandora's Box </em>in Vienna&nbsp;at a private performance <font face="Symbol">- </font>Tilly played Lulu, but this time Wedekind took the role of Jack the Ripper, and the writer <a href="kkraus.htm">Karl Kraus</a>&nbsp;
played Kung Poti.&nbsp;Mostly due to Wedekind's jealousy, the
&nbsp;marriage was stormy and disturbed. He was twenty years her senior
and reacted to her as if she were the real Lulu, though she submitted
to his every demand.&nbsp; Wedekind also forced&nbsp;Tilly to give up
her independent acting contract. </p><p>Tilly's
father once&nbsp;noted, "Frank can't be surprised about anything, he
has married Lulu, after all." Moreover, Wedekind's son wrote a play in
which a son falls in love with his father's young wife. In
1917&nbsp;Tilly tried to commit suicide, just a few month's before her
husband's death. "Clear, precise voice of the woman," wrote Franz Kafka
on Tilly in his diary after seeing <i>Der Erdgeist</i> in 1912.
"Narrow, crescent-shaped face. The lower part of the leg branching off
to the lefet when she stood quietly." Wedekind died in Munich on March
9, 1918. A crowd of prostitutes, his fans, also attended the funeral.
During the Nazi period, his works were forbidden. Wedekind's diary, <i>Die Tagebücher: ein erotisches Leben</i>, was published in 1986. </p><p>Wedekind's
uncompromising plays, full of rebellious energy, have always fascinated
new generations of directors and actors, amongst others in Finland,
where <i>Lulu</i> was successfully staged in 2006 by the students of
The Theatre Academy. Wedekind's stock of characters vary from pillars
of society to prostitutes, outcasts, beggars, and criminals. The most
famous creation, Lulu, falls from the&nbsp;heights of
society&nbsp;into&nbsp;poverty and&nbsp;prostitution. She is a force of
nature, a wild, beautiful beast, the embodiment of pure female
sexuality, who destroys weak men around her until she&nbsp;meets
her&nbsp;death&nbsp;at the hands of <a href="sickert.htm">Jack the Ripper</a>.
"She was created to stir up great disaster," said Wedekind of Lulu. At
a lecture in May 1905, Karl Kraus remarked, that she became the
destroyer of all, because she was destroyed by all. </p><p>The main
reason why the Lulu plays were divided into two separate works was that
the last two acts involved lesbianism and prostitution, which were at
that time too touchy subjects for the stage. In Pabst's silent film
Lulu has spirit and dignity, she is not mean. At the end her death
suggest a salvation; basically she is the victim of weak men. The
original running time of Pabst's film was 131 minutes. In Britain the
scene between Lulu and the lesbian Countess Geschwitz at Lulu's wedding
was cut. </p>
<p>Alban Berg began compressed <i>Lulu</i> plays into a single musical
work in 1929, which portrays the rise and fall of its protagonist in a
symmetrically mirrored arch. Noteworthy, Berg had been in 1905 present
at a performance of the second part of the drama, introduced by a
lecture by Karl Kraus. The definitive version of Berg's&nbsp; <i>Die Büchse der Pandora </i>did
not premiere until 1979, because the composer's widow Helene Berg, a
spiritualist, prevented the completion of her husband's work. At the
time of his death in 1935,&nbsp;Berg had not finished the orchestration
of Act III <font face="Symbol">- </font>the three-act version was put
together by the Austrian composer Friedrich &#268;erha. This version
premiered in Paris under Pierre Boulez. Berg's opera, influenced by
Nietzsche's theory of "eternal return", is not a moral tale; also Berg
do not condemn Lulu, who cannot help being the target of desires. Erik
Bentley's <em>The Wedekind Cabaret</em>, based on the author's poems
and songs, was published in 1993. Music was composed by William Bolcom,
Arnold Black, and Peter Winkler. </p>
