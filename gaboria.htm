<P>French 19th century mystery writer, novelist, and journalist,  one of the pioneers of the modern <I>roman policier</I>. Gaboriau's first book of the genre, <I>L'Affaire Lerouge</I> (1865) introduced an amateur detective, who works logically. In the same book appeared also a young policeman named Lecoq,  the hero in three of Gaboriau's detective novels. Lecoq was based on a real-life thief turned a police, Fran&#231;ois Vidocq (1775-1857), whose memoirs, <I>Les Vrais M&#233;moires de Vidocq</I>, mixed fiction and fact. In his own time Gaboriau gained a huge popularity, but when <A HREF="acdoyle.htm">Arthur Conan Doyle </A>created Sherlock Holmes, Lecoq's international fame declined. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;When I examined the lawn,&quot; pursued M. Lecoq, &quot;I found the parallel trails of the feet, but yet the grass was crushed over a rather wide space.  How was that?  Because it was the body, not of a man, but of a woman, which was dragged across the lawn - of a woman full-dressed, with heavy petticoats; that, in short, of the countess, and not of the count.&quot;</B></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"> (from </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">The Mystery of Orcival</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, 1867) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#201;mile Gaboriau was born in the small town of Saujon, Charente-Martime, the son of Charles-Gabriel Gaboriau, a minor public official, and Marguerite-St&#233;phanie Gaboriau (n&#233;e Magistrel). The family moved in 1833 to Saint-Pierre d'Oleron and four years later to La Rochelle, where &#201;mile's sister, Am&#233;lie, was born. Gaboriau studied in Tarasconsur-Rh&#244;ne at the community secondary school. He met Alphonse Millaud, whose uncle later published in his daily, <I>Le Soleil</I>, Gaboriau's novels in serialized form. After studies at a secondary school in Saumur, he entered the military service in 1851, serving in the Fifth Regiment as a second-class infantryman until the end of 1853. During this period he was sent with his regiment to Africa. Perhaps following his father's wishes, he  apprenticed himself to a notary. However, Gaboriau was more interested in writing, and he published a volume of poetry that went unnoticed. </P>
<P>After settling in Paris in 1856, Gaboriau worked as a journalist, writing columns for the short-lived weekly journal <I>La V&#233;rit&#233;</I>. He also covered the Italian campaign of Napoleon III. In 1860 Gaboriau  became a secretary, assistant, and ghost writer to Paul F&#233;val, a newspaper editor, dramatist, and  author of criminal romances for <I>feuilletons, </I>serial leaflets of French daily newspapers. For his stories Gaboriau gathered material in police courts, morgues, and prisons. In the early 1860s Gaboriau published his first books, but it was not until <I>L'Affaire Lerouge </I>when he started to gain success. Over the years, he wrote a dozen or so novels. His works were translated into English, German, and Italian. In Japan Gaboriau enjoyed great popularity in Ruiko Kuriowa's translations. During the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 Gaboriau was in Paris. He married in 1873 Am&#233;lie Rogelet, who had been his companion of eleven years, but the marriage ended abruptly. Gaboriau died of pulmonary apoplexy on 28 September, 1873. His last detective character was Goudar. He saves an innocent man  from a sentence of twenty years of hard labor in <I>La Corde au cou </I>(1873). The protagonist of the story  is M. Galpin, a magistrate. </P>
<P>Lecoq model, Vidocq began as a criminal during the times of the French Revolution. He spent much time is prison, escaped, turned informed and eventually became Chef de la S&#251;rete, who boasted: &quot;It always astonished people reporting a theft, for example, that, given some detail which seemed insignificant to them, I could reconstruct the entire crime, or say: 'That man is the criminal.'&quot; Self-confidence was also one of Lecoq personal traits. In his youth Lecoq was forced to take menial jobs to finance his legal studies. There are shady spots in his past, but after joining the S&#251;rete he becomes its best detective, a master of disguise, and developer of the method of using plaster to make impressions of footprints. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;I know the goings on in your establishment.  It isn't always to talk about dress that ladies stop at your place on returning from the Bois.  You sell silks and satins no doubt; but you sell Madeira, and excellent cigarettes as well, and there are some who don't walk very straight on leaving your establishment, but smell suspiciously of tobacco and absinthe.  Oh, yes, let us go to law, by all means! I shall have an advocate who will know how to explain the parts your customers pay, and who will reveal how, with your assistance, they obtain money from other sources than their husband's cash-box.&quot;</B> (from </FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><I>Baron Trigault's Vengeance</I>, 1870) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Gaboriau emphasized more the process of detection, gathering and interpreting of evidence, than the crime or the criminal. Moreover, he portrayed policemen as professionals, who are honest and sympathetic fellows. Many of his villains are aristocrats. </P>
<P>Gaboriau  knew the work of <A HREF="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</A>, considering himself as a discipline of the American writer. Like Poe's hero the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, Lecoq was a sharp analyst, and he could astonish his companions with his skills. As a detective Lecoq  matched Holmes in interpreting the meaning of small details. Lecoq has only to look at the snow-covered ground outside an inn to describe the man who passed by half an hour earlier &#150; he is middle-aged, very tall, wears a shaggy overcoat and is married. This did not prevent Sherlock Holmes from describing his French rival as &quot;a miserable bungler&quot; in <I>A Study in Scarlet</I> (1886) &quot;...he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill,&quot; Holmes mocked Gaboriau's <I>Monsieur Lecoq </I>(1868). Doyle himself was impressed his French colleague, writing in <I>Memories and Adventures </I>(1924), &quot;Gaboriau had rather attracted me by the neat dovetailing of his plots.&quot; </P>
<P>Lecoq's companion in solving crimes, P&#233;re Tabaret, formerly a pawnbroker's clerk, was the central character in <I>L'Affaire Lerouge</I>, in which Lecoq made only a cameo appearance. It was first published in installments in <I>Le Pays </I>in 1865, and then reprinted in <I>Le Soleil</I> in 1866. The story involved family secrets, illegitimate children, aristocrats, and murder. P&#233;re Tabaret is nicknamed &quot;Tirauclair&quot; because of his habit of saying, &quot;Il Faut que cela se tire au clair&quot;. However, it is Claire, the falsely accused fiancee, who  intuitively understands the evidence more clearly. At the the old detective concludes, that &quot;the evidence of one's senses proves nothing.&quot; </P>
<P>Lecoq has then the central role in <I>Le crime d'Orcival </I>(1867), in which the dead body of the charming Countess de Tremorel prompts a murder investigation, and  <I>Le dossier no. 113</I> (1867), a story of a bank robbery and false identities. In <I>Monsieur Lecoq </I>(1868) he still is the hero, but in <I>Les Esclaves du Paris</I> (1868)  non-detective characters help the police.  Following the model of Balzac's<I> La Com&#233;die humaine</I>, Gaboriau also published novels examining contemporary manners and morals. His other works include  historical studies and biographies of famous actresses. </P>
