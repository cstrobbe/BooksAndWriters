<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific American writer, who published from
1939 to 1976 more
than 60 mystery novels that featured the Miami-based private detective
Michael Shayne and his beautiful secretary and girlfriend Lucy
Hamilton. Dresser wrote under several pseudonyms, but his fame rests on
these books, written under the name Brett Halliday. His protagonist is
a red-headed, wisecracking pulp hero, who follows his own code of right
and wrong. The novels have
been translated into several languages (among others into Finnish),
made into motion pictures, television
series, and radio plays. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Lucy was slim and straight and supple.
She had clear brown eyes and a sweetly rounded face with a firm chin.
She said, "No wonder you don't get ahead in this competitive world.
There's a client outside. </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Murder Is My Business</font></i><font size="2">, 1945) </font></blockquote>
<p>Brett Halliday was born Davis Dresser in Chicago, Illinois, but he
grew up in West Texas. As a boy, Dresser lost an eye to barbed wire,
and for the rest of his life, he wore an eyepatch. Before becoming a
writer, Dresser lived an action packed life &#8211; if the stories are to
believed. According to some biographical sources, he joined the United
States Army Cavalry at the age of 14 and rode with Pershing chasing
Pancho Villa, before the army discovered his age and discharged him. (<b>Note</b>: About at the same 
time, during the Russian Civil War, the writer <a href="babel.htm">Isaak Babel</a> joined Semyon 
Budenny's cavalry.<font size="2">) </font>After
these experiences, Dresser returned to Texas to finish the high school.
In his quest for adveture, he then worked as a worked as a roughneck in
oil fields, from Texas to California. For a period, he was a deckhand
on an oil tanker. On resuming his studies, he entered Tri-State College
in Indiana, graduating in Civil Engineering, and earned his living as a
badly paid engineer and a surveyor. In 1927, two years before the Great
Depression, he tried his hand at creative writing, and kept on trying
over a decade without much success. </p>
<p>Dresser 
contributed first to pulp magazines and produced some love stories.  As 'Anthony Scott' he published 
in 1934 <i>Mardi Grass Madness</i> and <i>Test of Virtue</i>, and under the pseudonym 
'Elliot Storm', he wrote<i> Two Femmes in Fairyland</i> (1935), 
<i>Hot Date (Shame Girl)</i>, <i>Two Tickets West</i> and <i>Strange Bedmates</i>. <i> </i>Dresser's first novel was <i>Mums The Word For Murder</i>
(1938), narrated by Asa Baker and featuring a former cowboy, Jerry
Burke, who is appointed "co-ordinator of all the law enforecement
agencies in El Paso". </p>

<p>After twenty-two rejections and four years, Dresser found a publisher &#8211; Henry Holt &amp; Co.&#8211; for <i>Dividend on 
Death</i>  (1939), the first Michael Shayne novel. In the 
story Halliday himself becomes the chief suspect in the murder of a young woman. He summons his friend 
Mike Shayne to New York. Shayne finds the real killer, and repays his debt to his chronicler. From this 
book on, Dresser's stories began to gain fame. The next book, <i>The Private Practice of Michael Shayne</i>  
(1940), was a commercial success.</p>
<p>Michael Shayne is a tall Irishman. His<b> </b> background is vague,
but before starting his own business he was an employee of a large
detective agency in New York. "It is my impression that he is not a
college man, although he is well educated, has a good vocabulary and is
articulate on variety on subjects," said Dresser once. Since moving to
Miami, Shayne established a reputation as the city's ace PI. Dresser
himself did not live in Florida, but in California, and the local color
was not so vivid. Shayne drinks Martell, which is quality cognac, with
a glass of cold water, but he is far from such heavy-drinkers as <a href="latimer.htm">William Crane</a>, or Dashiell Hammett's Nick Charles. And he seldom uses his gun, a .38 revolver. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Call for Michael Shayne</span> (1949) begins with a long description of a headache and nausea&nbsp;
&#8211; the longest in the series. An insurance executive named Arthur Devlin
wakes up in a hotel room. Devlin doesn't remember anything from the
past two weeks. And there is a dead man under the bed. Shayne solves
the mystery in less than twenty-four hours. During the course of his
investigation, Shayne is knocked unconscious, he visits two bars,
drinks cognac,  a coctail, a drink from his liquor cabinet, and whisky,
and travels from Miami to Key West and back, and then to Marlin Key. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Blonde Cried Murder</span>
(1956) the action takes place between 21.32 o'clock and midnight.
Shayne gets his glass of Martell cognag after 23.43 o'clock at the
Silver Glade.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>In <i>The Uncomplaining 
Corpse</i> (1940) Shayne marries a young woman named Phyllis Brighton, whom he had helped in <i>Divided On Death</i> and engaged in<i> The Private Practice of Michael Shayne</i>. Phyllis thinks that she has "an Electra complex" &#8211; 
she is a lesbian. She dies in childbirth in<i> On the Black Market</i> (1943). 
A new woman, Lucille Hamilton, takes her place in Shayne's  life and office in <i>Michael 
Shayne's Long Change</i> (1944). However, Shayne do not marry her. Other characters are the crime 
reporter and Shayne's drinking buddyTimothy Rourke,  and Will Gentry, chief of police of Miami. Shayne's adversary is Peter Painter, 
chief of detectives across the bay in Miami Beach. </p>

<p>According to the author himself, Shayne's model was a real-life
character, whom he met in his youth at a bar in Tampico, Mexico. When a
fight broke out with local Mexicans and American sailors, Dresser was
knocked on the floor, and a six-foot, one inch tall redhead dragged him
away from the fray. Years later Dresser bumped into the same man in New
Orleans' French Quarter, in a Rampart Street bar, learning that he was
a private detective on a case, but just at the moment sitting with a
bottle of cognac in front of him. "He had a tall angular body that
concealed a lot of solid weight, and his freckled cheeks were thin to
gauntness. His rumpled hair was violent red, giving him a little-boy
look curiously in contrast with the harshness of his features. When he
smiled, the harshness went out his face and he didn't look at all a
hard-boiled private detective who had come on the top the tough way."<b> </b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Dividend 
on Death</font></i><font size="2">)</font><font size="2"></font> </p>
<p>In the timeless world of Michael Shayne, the character survived well into the 1980s. 
Because the basic formula employed in 1939 remained intact,  it was not difficult for 
other writers to continue the adventures. Sometimes Shayne solved classical "
locked room" mysteries, as in<i> This Is It, Michael Shayne</i> (1950), where 
a scandal reporter is found dead in her office. In <i>Murder and the Married Virgin</i>  
(1944) a Katrin Moe, a Norwegian woman dies of gas in her room. She has worked as a 
housemaid for the rich Lomax family, but his fiancé doesn't believe that she 
committed suicide. Also a precious necklace has disappeared. The story is set in 
New Orleans, where Shayne had moved his office after the death of Phyllis. <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Killers from the Keys</i> (1961), 
ghost-written by Wallace Ryerson Johnson, follow Halliday's typical story lines, in 
which beautiful women are often treacherous, even when they ask Shayne's help. Only 
his secretary, Lucy Hamilton, is faithful to him. During his investigations, Shayne 
also starts to suspect that he has become too soft in the tropical Miami. However, 
he doesn't give up his principles <font face="Symbol">-</font> he trusts in 
his two fists and doesn't carry a gun.</p>

<p>The Shayne series eventually numbered some seventy volumes, and the hero was seen 
between 1940 and 1947 in twelve films.  In  <i>Time to Kill,</i> based on Raymond 
Chandler's novel <i>The High Window</i>,
the crime solver was not Philip Marlowe but detective Mike Shayne. Fox
paid Chandler $3,500 for screen rights, adapting it for Lloyd Nolan as
Shayne. In the story Shayne's services were needed in a case that
involved counterfeiters of rare coins. On radio, Michael Shayne,
Private Detective, was aired from 1944 to 1947; the lead was plated by
Wally Maher. Shayne appeared again in a CBS series <i>The New Adventures of Michael Shayne</i>, from 1948 to 1950, 
with Jeff Chandler as the private eye, and then in ABC broadcast <i>Michael Shayne, Private Detective</i>, with Donald Curtis from 1952 to 1953.</p>
<p>Lloyd Nolan was one the most versatile actors in Hollywood, and his first Shayne 
film in 1940, actually based on <i>The Private Practice of Michael Shayne</i>, not on <i>Dividend on Death</i>,
had a more elaborate loking production than many B films. The script
was written by Stanley Rauhn and Nabbing O'Connor. Nolan, who had often
played a gangster or a policeman, starred in seven films in 1941-42.
Shayne' secretary Lucy Haminton was renamed Phyllis Hamilton. Except
this first, <i>Michael Shayne, Private Detective</i>, 20th-Fox did not use no further 
Halliday novels as sources for films. Several of the movies were adapted from 
novels by other authors about other detectives. <i>Sleepers West </i>(1941), 
remade of <i>Sleepers East </i>(1934), was taken from a Frederick Nebel novel. 
<i>Blue, White and Perfect </i>(1941), about diamond smuggling, was developed 
from a story by Borden Chase, serialized in <i>Argosy Magazine</i> in 1937. Later it appeared as a short novel, entitled <i>Diamonds of Death</i>. The screenplay was written by Samuel G. Engel.  
</p>
<p>Clayton Rawson's novel about his hero, the Great Merlini, gave the plot to 
<i>The Man Who Wouldn't Die</i> (1942); Rawson himself had been a famous magician before he turned to writing. In <i>Time to Kill </i>(1942), 
directed by Herbert I. Leeds, Shayne met counterfeiters of rare coins. 
This was one of the best of the Michael Shayne movies. It was remade as <i>The Brasher Doubloon</i>
(1947), starring George Montgomery. Producers Releasing Corporation
("PCR") made five features, starring Hugh Beaumont, a Hollywood
character actor, who gained fame in the<i> Leave It to Beaver</i> television series. Four of the 
films were directed by Samuel Newfeld; William Beaudine directed one. A TV series 
was made in 1960, starring Richard Denning. Arnaud d&#8217;Usseau, who was 
placed on the blacklist in the 1950s, wrote the screenplay for <i>Just Off 
Broadway</i> (1942). </p>
<p>From 1946 to 1961, Dresser  was married to the mystery writer <a href="hmccloy.htm">Helen McCloy</a>.
They were also partners in a literary agency that bore their names, as
well as in Toquil Publishing Company, which from 1953 to 1964 published
the adventures of Michael Shayne. With Bill S. Ballinger, he scripted
two episodes of the TV series <i>Ironside</i>, entitled <i>The Macabre Mr. Micawber</i> (1968) and <i>Officer Bobby</i> (1968). Dresser retired 
virtually from writing in 
the late 1950s, and used ghostwriters, among others Robert Terrall, Wallace Ryerson Johnson, Dennis Lynds. James 
Reasoner continued the work after Dresser's death. Bill Pronzini ghost-wrote some stories about Mike Shayne. 
Dresser's collaboration with Kathleen Rollins in <i>Before I Wake</i> (1949) and <i>A Lonely Way to Die</i>
(1950) led eventually to their marriage; she was his second wife. The
books were published under the pseudonym 'Hal Debrett'. Dresser's third
wife was Mary Savage, also an accomplished writer. <i>Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine</i> began to appear in 1956, until its cancellation in 1990. Dresser was  a founding 
member of the Mystery Writers of America, and in 1953 he was given an Edgar Award for his criticism. Although Shayne's 
adventures were mostly set in Florida, Dresser's longtime home was in Southern California. He died on February 4, 1977.
