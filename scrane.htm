<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American author, whose unromanticized war
novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Red Badge of Courage</span>
(1895), brought him international fame. Crane's first novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Maggie: A Girl of the Streets</span>, was
a milestone in the development of literary naturalism. At its
appearance in 1893 Crane was just twenty-one. His manuscript was turned
down by the publishers, who considered its realism too "ugly". Crane
had to print the book at his own expense, borrowing the money from his
brother. In its inscription Crane warned that "it is inevitable that
you be greatly shocked by this book but continue, please, with all
possible courage to the end." The story of the descent of a slum girl
in turn-of-the-century New York into prostitution was first published
under the pseudonym of Johnston Smith. <i>Maggie</i> was generally
ignored by readers but it won the admiration of other realist writers.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the street infants played or
fought with other infants or sat stupidly in the way of vehicles.
Formidable women, with uncombed hair and disordered dress, gossiped
while leaning on railings, or screamed in frantic quarrels. Withered
persons, in curious postures of submission to something, sat smoking
pipes in obscure corners. A thousand odors of cooking food came forth
to the street. The building quivered and creaked from the weight of
humanity stamping about in its bowels."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Maggie</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Stephen Crane was born in Newark, New Jersey, the 14th child
of a Methodist minister Jonathan Townley Crane and his wife Mary Helen
Peck Crane. Crane began to write stories at the age of eight; also both
of his parents did some writing and two of his brothers became
newspapermen. Crane's mother was active in the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, and published fiction. Reverend Dr. Crane, an
advocate of temperance, published <i>The Arts of Intoxication: The Aim
and the Results</i>, a condemnation of alcohol. Crane's first article,
on the explorer Henry M. Stanley, appeared in 1890 in <i>Villette</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Crane studied at Lafayette College and Syracuse University.
After his mother's death in 1890 <font face="Symbol">-</font> his
father had died earlier <font face="Symbol">-</font> Crane moved to
New York. He worked as a free-lance writer and journalist for the
Bachellor-Johnson newspaper syndicate. While supporting himself by his
pen, he lived among the poor in the Bowery slums to research his first
novel, <i>Maggie: A Girl of the Streets</i>. In England the subtitle
was changed to 'A Child of the Streets. 'Maggie' was a common slang
term for a female prostitute; in French the word is 'grue', which also
means 'crane'. Possibly Crane had read Jacob A. Riis's books <i>How
the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York</i>
(1890) and <i>The Children of the Poor</i> (1892), studies of the
conditions of slum life. In the novellette <span style="font-style: italic;">George's Mother</span> (1896), originally
entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">A Woman Without Weapons</span>,
Crane returned to the city life, especially to the lot of the idlers.
Maggie Johnson also made a brief appearance as the dream girl of one of
the characters. Crane's faithfulness to accuracy of details led him
once to dress up as a tramp and spend the night in a flophouse. This
produced the sketch 'Experiment in Misery' in 1894. Crane's pioneering
novel inspired other writers, such as Hutchins Hapgood (1869-1944), to
examine the Lower East Side. </p>
      <p>Crane's <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> depicted the American
Civil War from the point of view of an ordinary soldier. In England
readers believed that the book was written by a veteran soldier <font face="Symbol">-</font> the text was so believable. Crane dismissed
this theory by saying that he got his ideas from the football field.
The central character is Henry Fleming, who enrolls as a soldier in the
Union army. He has dreamed of battles and glory all his life, but his
expectations are shattered in his encounter with the enemy. Witnessing
the chaos on the battle field, he starts to fear that the regiment was
leaving him behind, and flees from the battle. "Since he had turned his
back upon the fight his fears had been wondrously magnified. Death
about to thrust him between the shoulder blades was far more dreadful
than death about to smite him between the eyes. When he thought of it
later, he conceived the impression that it is better to view the
appalling than to be merely within hearing. The noises of the battle
were like stones; he believed himself liable to be crushed." </p>
      <p>Henry wanders into a thick wood, and meets a group of wounded
men. He tries to help a tall soldier, who dies, and leaves a tattered
soldier on a field. He returns to the lines and a deserter hits him
with a gun. Henry gets a head wound. Marked now by the "red badge" he
falls asleep with his comrades in the evening Next day he feels sore
and stiff from his experiences, but in his hatred starts to shoot
blindly at the enemy. "Some of the men muttered and looked, awe struck,
at the youth. It was plain that as he had gone on loading and firing
and cursing without the proper intermission, they had found time to
regard him. And they now looked upon him as a war devil." In the heat
of the battle, he picks up the regiment's flag with his friend when it
falls from the color sergeant's hands. An officer, who has called him
and the other soldiers "mule drivers", calls them again "a lot of mud
diggers". Henry wants to die in the battle to prove the officer is
wrong. He tries to seize the enemy flag, but his friend is faster and
wrenches it free from the hands of the dying color bearer. He is filled
with guilt when he remembers the tattered soldier whom he had deserted.
"Yet the youth smiled, for he saw that the world was a world for him,
though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He
had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was
in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat
and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of
tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks <font face="Symbol">-</font>
an existence of soft and eternal peace." <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>
has been called the first modern war novel, but it also borrows from
the conventions of a <i>bildungsroman</i>: after the final battle,
Henry has matured, and he understands better his personal strengths and
weaknesses. Later Crane portayed his hero in the story 'The Veteran'
(1896), in which Henry Fleming, eventually promoted to orderly
sergeant, recount his battle experiences to his grandson and dies while
attempting to rescue colts from his burning barn. </p>
      <p>Crane's collection of poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Black Rider</span> (1895), has much in common with Emily Dickinson's
simple, stripped style. Crane's rising fame brought him better
reporting assignments and he sought experiences as a war correspondent
in combat areas. Crane travelled to Greece, Cuba, Texas and Mexico,
reporting mostly on war events. <span style="font-style: italic;">Active
Service</span> (1899) was based on the Greco-Turkish War.</p>
      <p>The short story, 'The Open Boat,' is based on a true
experience, when his ship, a coal-burning tug heavy with ammunition and
machetes, sank on the journey to Cuba in 1896. With a small party of
other passengers, Crane spent several days drifting in a dinghy off the
coast of Florida before being rescued. This experience impaired his
health permanently. In the story, originally published in <i>Scribner's
Magazine </i>in June 1897, Crane focused on four men, who eventually
decide to swim for shore. </p>
      <blockquote><font color="White" size="2">-<b>-</b></font><b><font size="2">When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as
important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by
disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and
he hates deeply the fact that there are no bricks and no temples. Any
visible expression of nature would surely be pelleted with his jeers.</font><br>
        <font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">Then, if
there be no tangible thing to hoot at he feels, perhaps, the desire to
confront a personification and indulge in pleas, bowed to one knee, and
with hands supplicant, saying: 'Yes, but I love myself.' </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'The Open Boat') </font></blockquote>
      <p>In Greece Crane wrote about the Greco-Turkish War, settling in
1898 in Sussex, England, where he lived with the author Cora Taylor,
who was the proprietress of the Hotel de Dream, a well-known
Jacksonville sporting house. In England Crane became friends with <a href="jconrad.htm">Joseph Conrad</a>, <a href="hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>,
and H<a href="hjames.htm">enry James</a>. During this period Crane
wrote some of his best stories, including 'The Monster,' 'The Bride
Comes to Yellow Sky,' and 'The Blue Hotel' (1898), Crane's much
anthologized short story, which was first published serially in <i>Collier's
Weekly</i>. Swede, a nervous New Yorker, fascinated by tales of the
Wild West, enters Pat Scully's hotel in Fort Romper, Nebraska; the
hotel is a haven of rest in a blizzard. Swede meets Mr. Blanc from the
East, and a reserved cowboy. He drinks heavily and beats Scully's son,
Johnnie, after accusing him of cheating at cards. When the Swede
attacks another hotel customer, he is stabbed and killed. Several
months later Mr. Blanc, feeling responsible for the death, confesses
that Johnnie indeed cheated. In a letter from 1898 Conrad wrote to
Crane: "You have the terseness, the clear eye the easy imagination. You
have all <font face="Symbol">-</font> and I have only the accursed
faculty of dreaming. My ideas fade <font face="Symbol">-</font> Yours
come out sharp cut as cameos <font face="Symbol">-</font> they come
all living out of Your brain and bring images <font face="Symbol">-</font>
and bring light." Like <a href="ezola.htm">Emile Zola</a> (1840-1902)
in France, Crane used realism <font face="Symbol">-</font> or
naturalism <font face="Symbol">-</font> as a method of exposing social
ills, as in <span style="font-style: italic;">The George's Mother</span>,
which explored life in the Bowery. Crane himself did not much like
Zola.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> </p>
      <p>In 1898 Crane returned to Cuba, to cover the Spanish-American
War for Joseph Pulitzer's <i>New York World</i>. He was involved in
combat, covered the landings at Guantánamo, the advance of Rough
Riders, and the Battle of San Juan Hill. According to Crane, the
dismounted Rough Riders "marched noisily through the narrow road in the
woods, talking volubly", and were then ambushed, suffering heavy
losses. Crane concluded that "It was simply a gallant blunder." In
Havanna Crane completed most of the Cuban War stories, but did not tell
his family or Cora where he was. Due to poor health he was obliged to
return to England. There he rented with Cora a cold and wet
14th-century Sussex estate, called Brede Place. Crane died on June 5,
1900, at Badenweiler in Germany of tuberculosis, that was worsened by
malarial fever he had caught in Cuba. He was 28 <font face="Symbol">-</font>
his career has lasted only eight years. Crane's posthumous publications
include the sketches and stories from his life as a correspondent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Wounds in the Rain</span> (1900) and
Whilomville Stories (1900), depicting a childhood in a small state.
After Crane's death his work was neglected for many years until such
writers as Amy Lowell and Willa Cather brought it again to public
attention. Although Crane introduced realism into American literature,
his use of symbolism also gave his work a romantic quality.</p>
