<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British mystery writer, lawyer, and country
court judge in Surrey, who combined in his work  his knowledge of subleties of 
law with sympathetic portrayal of his characters and unexpected plot developments. 
Hare's most famous work is <span style="font-style: italic;">Tragedy at Law</span> (1942), widely
acclaimed as one of the great classics of detective novel. In 1987 the critic and 
mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included it  among the 100 best crime and mystery 
books ever published. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The book is also a first-rate 'backgrounder', 
one of those detective stories half of whose attraction lies in the setting in which 
the crime takes place, in this case the legal world in general and circuit life 
in particular. And, finally, the book contrives in those last pages to be a 
beautifully unguessable murder story."</b> (from <i>Crime &amp; Mystery: 
the 100 Best Books</i> by H.R.F. Keating, 1987) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Hare's pricipal series characters were Ispector Mallet and a fellow barrister 
Francis Pettigrew, who first appeared  in <i>Tragedy at Law</i> as an unhappy, 
near-defeated aging lawyer. In<span style="font-style: italic;"> With a Bare Bodkin&nbsp; </span>(1946) he  meets Miss Eleanor 
Brown, a young woman half his age, and later has peaceful retirement 
in <span style="font-style: italic;">He Should Have Died Hereafter</span> (1958). Pettigrew, 
as a character, is carefully developed  book by book by the author, who 
once remarked that writers may be excused, if they surround 
principal policeman with contrasting colorful types and 
streamline police routines. 
Hare had a good ear for different social languages.
His narration is 
mildly humorous and charming, but he did not make condescending fun 
 of ordinary police officers,  familiar from the work of Dorothy 
Sayers. Basically, the real target of Hare's irony was the 
speech and pretentious manners of the British upper classes, especially 
the judges of the High Court of Justice: "There is however, 
something about judical garments that gives consequence to any 
but the most undignified figure," Hare wrote in <i>Tragedy at Law</i>.  
      </p>



<p>Cyril Hare was born  Alfred Alexander Gordon Clark in Mickleham, Surrey. 
His father, Henry Herbert Gordon Clark, ran the family  wine and spirit 
business, Matthew Clark &amp; Sons.  
Most of his early years 
Hare spent in the country, where he learned to hunt, shoot, and fish. After studies 
at St Aubyn's, Rottingdean and Rugby, Hare entered the New 
College, Oxford, and was called to the bar in 1924, fulfilling his part of the family tradition. 

In 1933, he married Mary Barbara Lawrence; they one son and two daughters, 
With his family, he settled in Cyril Mansions, Battersea, London. 
At the bar Hare's practice was largely in the civil and criminal courts in and around London. 
He worked in the firm of noted barrister Ronald Oliver, in Hare Court, Temple, where 
many of the great 
crime cases of the 1920s were handled.  
During World War II, 
Hare toured as a judge's marshal for some time. This experience formed the background for 
<i>Tragedy at Law</i>. In 1942, he was employed as a Temporary Legal Assistant in the Director 
of Public Prosecutions Department. He then served with the Ministry of Economic Warfare.   
From 1950, he was County Court Judge in Surrey. Hare's duties then concerned civil disputes only. 
</p>
<p>After some occasional sketches for <i>Punch</i> and other journals, Hare published his 
first mystery novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tenant for Death</span> (1937). It dealt with the disappearance of a financier, 
who is the found dead in South Kensington. His pseudonym Hare took from his London home, 
and his Temple chambers, Hare Court, where he worked.

The well-received debut was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Death Is No Sportsman</span> (1938), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Suicide Expected</span> (1939), which were good, solid mysteries, but did 
not drew to any great extent on his legal background. Hare's great interest in music is seen 
in <span style="font-style: italic;">When the Wind Blows</span> (1949). <i>Tragedy at Law</i> was set in the legal world. In the story 
Mr Justice Barber, journeying from court to court, receives threatening notes and a mysterious 
stranger arranges nasty surprises for him, until on page 253 out of a total of 290, the dagger 
gets thrust between his shoulders. Pettigrew appears as an amateur detective, who doesn't have 
much pages between the murder and its solution. </p>
<p>In <i>With a Bare Bodkin</i> Hare returned to the atmosphere of WW II. The story 
is set in a remote part of Britain, Marsett Bay, where Francis Pettigrew and 
his civil service 
branch is sent to escape the Blitz. Hare keeps the pace slow, plays with the labyrinth of fiction 
within fiction, and murder doesn't 
occur until halfway through the book. Pettigrew falls in love with his secretary, Miss Brown, 
who is courted by a widowed man who much her senior. In <span style="font-style: italic;">An English Murder</span> (1951) Hare used the 
conventional setting<font face="Symbol">-</font>a country house<font face="Symbol">-</font>and 
the usual suspects<font face="Symbol">-</font>there is a butler<font face="Symbol">-</font>but 
managed to come out with an original and fresh tale. An English Christmas party is disturbed by 
a murder and a Czech refugee, Br. Bottwink, starts to help Scotland Yard. The book was made into a 
two-part television film in the Soviet Union under the title <i>A Very English Murder</i> (1975), 
directed by 
Samson Samsonov and produced by Mosfilm. </p>

<p>Hare joined the the 
Detection Club in 1946. Along with the London solicitor Michael Gilbert, 
Anthony Berkeley, 
John Dickson Carr, Agatha 
Christie, Dorothy L Sayers, and other member of the Club, Hare carried the  Golden Age tradition 
into the late 1950s. Hare died on 25 August, 1958, at the peak of his career. 
His last Pettigrew  story was <i>He Should Have Died Hereafter</i>, in which Pettigrew and 
his old friend Inspector Mallett solve the mystery of a disappeared body  in Exmoor.  </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was all of fifty years since he had last seen a hunted 
deer and now the sight of it in some way dispelled the enchantment of reminiscene in which he 
had been living up to that moment. Willy-nilly, he found himself looking at the hapless beast 
through the eyes of the elderly, urban humanitarian who had somehow evolved from that small 
boy." </b></font></blockquote>
<p>This  sight leads Pettigrew to recall an experience of his  childhood, which he had buried: 
he found a dead man in his childhood in Bolter's Tussock and left it there. The nightmare repeats 
itself when he again stumbles over a body on the moor. However, Pettigrew realizes that there must 
be a perfectly rational explanation to the whole thing and finds the answer from <i>The Adventures 
of Sherlock Holmes</i>.  Hare's later stories and articles were published in <i>Illustrated London 
News </i>and <i>The Law Journal</i>.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Best Detective Stories of Cyril Hare</span>, which came out in 1959, 
included two Pettigrew adventures and an introduction by Michael Gilbert, 
his friend and fellow-lawyer. Hare's <i>Tragedy at Law</i> fell in the hands of Gilbert while he was 
a prisoner of war during WW II. The book inspired him later in his career as a mystery writer. </p>
<p>Hare was not a prolific short story writer, but he nevertheless contributed stories to three CWA 
(the Crime Writers' Association) anthologies, <i>Choise of Weapons </i>(1958), edited by Michael 
Gilbert, <i>Planned Departures</i> (1958), edited by Elizabeth Ferrars,  and <i>Some Like Them 
Dead</i> (1960), edited by Roy Vickers. 'Name of Smith'  (1952), first published in the 
<i>Evening Standard</i>, illustarates Hare's ability to inject into his stories questions 
about truth and justice without being didactic. Based mostly on dialogue, it tells of a judge, 
"an old ruffian", whose soft side is revealed to his colleagues only after his death. 
The story was reperinted in <i>Mysterious Pleasures</i> (2003), celebrating the 50th anniversary 
of CWA.  In 'An Unpleasant Man', set in an English village close to an 
American airbase, the detective sergeant solves a  crime,  
when the murdered makes a mistake by using an American expression. </p>
