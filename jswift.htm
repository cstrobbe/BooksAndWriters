      <p>Irish author and journalist, dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral
(Dublin) from 1713, the foremost prose satirist in English language.
Swift became
insane in his last years, but until his death he was known as Dublin's
foremost citizen. Swift's most famous works is <i>Gulliver's Travels </i>(1726),
where the stories of Gulliver's experiences among dwarfs and giants are
best known. Swift gave to these journeys an air of authenticity and
realism and many contemporary readers believed them to be true. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"They look upon fraud as a greater
crime than theft, and therefore seldom fail to punish it with death;
for they alledge, that care and vigilante, with a very common
understanding, may preserve a man's goods from thieves; but honesty hat
no fence against superior cunning: and since it is necessary that there
should be a perpetual intercourse of buying and selling, and dealing
upon credit; where fraud is permitted or connived at, or hath no Law to
punish it, the honest dealer is always undone and the knave gets the
advantage."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Gulliver's Travels:</font></i><font size="2"> 'A Voyage to Lilliput') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin. His father, Jonathan Swift
Sr., a lawyer and an English civil servant, died seven month's before
his son was born. Abigail Erick, Swift's mother, was left without
private income to support her family. Swift was taken or "stolen" to
England by his nurse, and at the age of four he was sent back to
Ireland. Swift's mother returned to England, and she left her son to
her wealthy brother-in-law, Uncle Godwin. </p>
      <p>Swift studied at Kilkenny Grammar School (1674-82), Trinity
College in Dublin (1682-89), receiving his B.A. in 1686 and M.A. in
1692. At school Swift was not a very good good student and his teachers
noted his headstrong behavior. When the anti-Catholic Revolution of the
year 1688 aroused
reaction in Ireland, Swift moved to England to the household of Sir
William Temple
at Moor Park, Surrey <font face="Symbol">-</font> Lady Temple was a
relative of Swift's mother. He worked there as a secretary (1689-95,
1696-99), but did not like his position as a servant in the household. </p>
      <p>In 1695 Swift was ordained in the Church of Ireland
(Anglican), Dublin. While in staying in Moor Park, Swift also was the
teacher of a young girl, Esther Johnson, whom he called Stella. When
she grew up she become an important person in his life. Stella moved to
Ireland to live near him and followed him on his travels to London.
Their relationship was a constant source of gossips. According to some
speculations, they were married in 1716. Stella died in 1728 and Swift
kept a lock of her hair among his papers for the rest of his life. </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2">"As the common forms of good
manners were intended for regulating the conduct of those who have weak
understandings; so they have been corrupted by the persons for whose
use they were contrived. For these people have fallen into a needless
and endless way of multiplying ceremonies, which have been extremely
troublesome to those who practice them, and insupportable to everyone
else: insomuch that wise men are often more uneasy at the over civility
of these refiners, than they could possibly be in the conversations of
peasants or mechanics."</font></b><font size="2"> (from 'A Treatise on
Good Manners and Good Breeding', 1754) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After William Temple's death in 1699, Swift returned to
Ireland. He made several trips to London and gained fame with his
essays. Throughout the reign of Queen Anne (1702-14), Swift was one of
the central characters in the literary and political life of London.
From 1695 to 1696 Swift was the vicar of Kilroot. There he met Jane
Wairing, with whom he had an affair. For Swift's disappointment, she
did not consider him a suitable marriage partner. Between the years
1707 and 1709 Swift was an emissary for the Irish clergy in London.
Swift contributed to the 'Bickerstaff Papers' and to the <i>Tattler</i>
in 1708-09. He was a cofounder of the <i>Scriblerus Club</i>, which
included such member as <a href="apope.htm">Pope</a>, Gay, Congreve,
and Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford.</p>
      <p>In 1710 Swift tried to open a political career among Whigs but
changed his party and took over the Tory journal <i>The Examiner</i>.
With the accession of George I, the Tories lost political power. Swift
withdrew to Ireland. Hester Vanhomrigh, whom Swift had met in 1708, and
whom he had tutored, followed him to Ireland after her mother had died.
She was 22 years younger than Swift, who nicknamed her Vanessa. In the
poem 'Cadenus and Vanessa' from 1713 Swift wrote about the affair:
"Each girl, when pleased with what is taught, / Will have the teacher
in her thought." In 1723 Swift broke off the relationship; she never
recovered form his rejection. </p>
      <p>From 1713 to 1742 Swift was the dean of St. Patrick's
Cathedral. It is thought that Swift suffered from Ménière's disease or
Alzheimer's disease. Many considered him insane <font face="Symbol">-</font>
however, from the beginning of his twentieth year he had suffered from
deafness. Swift had predicted his mental decay when he was about 50 and
had remarked to the poet Edward Young when they were gazing at the
withered crown of a tree: "I shall be like that tree, I shall die from
the top."</p>
      <blockquote><b>Gulliver's Travels</b> (1726) Defoe's novel about Robinson
Crusoe
had appeared in 1719 and in the same vein Swift makes Lemuel Gulliver,
a surgeon and a sea captain, recount his adventures. In part one,
Gulliver is wrecked on an island where human beings are six inches
tall. The Lilliputians have wars, and conduct clearly laughable with
their self-importance and vanities <font face="Symbol">-</font> these
human follies only reduced into a miniature scale. Gulliver's second
voyage takes him to Brobdingnag. "I cannot but conclude that the bulk
of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin
that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth." He
meets giants who are practical but do not understand abstractions. In
the third voyage contemporary scientist are held up for ridicule:
science is shown to be futile unless it is applicable to human
betterment. Gulliver then travels to the flying island of Laputa and
the nearby continent and capital of Lagado. There he meets mad scientists
obsessed with their own special field and utterly ignorant of the rest
of the life. On the island of Glubbdubdrib Gulliver encounters a
community of sorcerers who can summon the spirits of the dead, allowing
him to converse with Alexander, Julius Caesar, Aristotle and others. He
meets Struldbrughs, who are immortal and, as a result, utterly
miserable and become senile in their 80s. In the fourth part Gulliver
visits the land of Houyhnhnms, where horses are intelligent but human
beings are not. The horses are served with degenerate creatures called
Yahoos, demonstrating that human race would destroy itself without
divine aid. The Houyhnhnms had just one child of each sex. Swift wrote the book with a serious purpose <font face="Symbol">-</font> "to mend the world".<i> Gulliver's Travels</i>
was a topical social satire, a work of propaganda, in which Swift
wanted to show the consequences of humanity's refusal to be reasonable.
It is still widely read all over the world <font face="Symbol">-</font>
especially the two first books are children's favorites <font face="Symbol">-</font>
and open to many interpretations. But when Defoe was an optimist,
Swift's in his bitter pessimism makes Gulliver return home, preferring
the company of horses to that of his family. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other traveller's tales</span>: Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>,
Marco Polo's Travels, <a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/defoe.htm">Daniel
Defoe</a>'s <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, adventures of <a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/munchh.htm">Baron Münchhausen </a> by
Rudolf Eric Raspe (1737-1794), etc. </blockquote>
      <p>Besides ridiculing human nature and the politics of Ireland and Britain, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gulliver's Travels&nbsp;</span>
included several important social and scientific observations. Seventy
years before Robert Malthus, Swift proposed population control, he
favored the Lilliputhian idea of having children reared by the State,
and he also stated that Mars had two moons; both satellites were not
discovered until 1877. Jonathan Swift died in Dublin on October 19,
1745. He left
behind a great mass of poetry and prose, chiefly in the form of
pamphlets. William Makepeace Thackeray once said of the author: "So
great a man he seems to me, that thinking of him is like thinking of an
empire falling." </p>
      <p>Swift's religious writing is little read today. His most
famous works include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Battle of
the Books</span> (1697), exploring the merits of the ancients and the
moderns in literature. The author himself pretends to be an objective
chronicler of events, but his sympathies are more on the side of the
ancients. <span style="font-style: italic;">A Tale of a Tub</span>
(1704) was a religious satire. Swift once stated that "satire is a sort
of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but
their own." At its core the tale a simple narrative of a father who has
triplets, Martin, Peter and Jack; they refer to different churches. The
father is of course God. Upon his death, he leaves them each a coat
which will grow with them. Swift finished the tale in 1697, but
hesitated to publish it. Although the work eventually appeared
anonymously, it established Swift's reputation. </p>
      <p>In<span style="font-style: italic;"> An Argument against
Abolishing Christianity</span> (1708) the narrator argues for the
preservation of the Christian religion as a social necessity. When an
ignorant cobbler named John Partridge published an almanac of
astrological predictions, Swift parodied it in <span style="font-style: italic;">Predictions For The Ensuing Year by Isaac
Bickerstaff</span>. He foretold the death of John Partridge on March,
1708, and affirmed on that day his prediction. Partridge protested that
he was alive but Swift proved in his 'Vindication' that he was dead. <span style="font-style: italic;">Drapier's Letters</span> (1724) was
against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood
to provide the Irish with copper coinage. <br>
</p>
      <p> The
narrator recommends in <span style="font-style: italic;">A Modest Proposal</span> (1729) with grotesque logic, that Irish poverty can be
solved by the breeding up their infants as food for the rich. When the
actor Peter O'Toole read it <font face="Symbol">-</font> for some
reason <font face="Symbol">-</font> in the reopening of the Gaiety
Theatre in Dublin in 1984, several members from the audience departed.
Swift has been labelled as a hater of mankind. "Principally I hate and
detest that animal called man; although I heartily love John, Peter,
Thomas, and so forth, " Swift wrote in a letter to Alexander Pope.
However, Swift defended ordinary Irish people against England's
economic oppression and he was known as a prankster. He also had a
philanthropical side. As a churchman Swift had spent a third of his
earnings on charities and he saved another third each year to found St.
Patrick's Hospital for Imbeciles in 1757.&nbsp;<br>
