<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> American thriller writer, who specialized
from the early 1950's in a multi-level kind of narration or divided
narration, and mixed identities. Ballinger's best known books include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wife of the Red-Haired Man&nbsp;</span>
(1957) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Tooth and the Naíl</span>
(1955). The latter was plagiarized by Finnish mystery writer <a href="msariola.htm">Mauri Sariola</a> in 1969, writing under the
pseudonym Esko Laukko. Sariola paid 5,400 Finnish marks (about $1,000
nowadays, then very much more) to Ballinger, who promised to give the
money to the Finnish Writers' Association. Ballinger's books have been
reprinted in some thirty countries, and translated into over thirteen
languages. Besides his thirty some odd novels, Ballinger wrote over 150
scripts for television and the movies. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I consider myself, primarily, a
storyteller. To me the story is the thing."</b> (Ballinger in </font><i><font size="2">St. James Guide to Crime &amp; Mystery Writers</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Jay P. Pederson, 1996)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Bill
Sanborn Ballinger was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa, the son of William M.
Ballinger and Ella Satia; she died in 1918. Ballinger was educated
at the University of Wisconsin, receiving his B.A. in 1934. From
1934 he worked in advertising, and as a radio and television writer. In
1936 he married Geraldine Taylor <font face="Symbol">-</font> they
divorced in 1946. After extensive travels in Europe and the Middle
East, Ballinger moved to southern California, to take advantage of the
television 'boom' of the 1950s as a scriptwriter. In 1949, he married
Laura Dunham; she died in 1962, and two years later he married Lucille
Rambeau.&nbsp;
</p>
      <p>In 1960, Ballinger received the Edgar Allan Poe Award from
Mystery Writers of America for his TV work, and he was the guest of
honor at the Boucheron World Mystery Convention II conference in 1971
in Los Angeles. Between the years 1977 and 1979, Ballinger served as an
associate professor of writing at the California State University,
Nortridge. He served also as a member of the board
of directors of Health and Welfare Plan and Pension Plan, and in
1978-79 President of Federal Credit Union. Ballinger died on March 23,
1980. His works of non-fiction include <span style="font-style: italic;">Lost City of Stone: The Story of Nan Madol, the "Atlantis" of the Pacific</span> (1978) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The California Story: Credit Union's First Fifty Years</span> (1979) </p>

      <p>In the beginning of his career, Ballinger published
hard-boiled detective fiction. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Body in the Bed </span>(1948), his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
introduced the private eye Barr Breed from Chicago, a typical tough
hero of the post-war fiction. However, Breed's office is not a dump, but
takes up a third of a floor and has and has panelled walls. The story
was more or less a variation of the <i>Maltese Falcon</i>. Breed's
second and last adventure, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Body
Beautiful</span> (1949), takes him to a nightclub, where a chorus girl
is knifed. Ballinger's first success was a nonseries book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Portrait in Smoke</span> (1950), in which
Danny April, the new owner of a collection agency, motivated by
curiosity, attempts to trace a girl named Krassy Almauniski from her
origins in Chicago's slums. Ballinger depicts also Krassy's rise to
fame and riches by changing her identity. Finally Danny finds Krassy,
falls in love with her, but she frames him guilty of murder. The books
was filmed in 1956 under the title <i>Wicked As They Come</i>. </p>
      <p>Ballinger soon abandoned the conventional detective formula,
and concentrated on creating more innovative thrillers.<i> The Wife of
the Red-Haired Woman</i> alternated between first-person and
third-person narration. Moreover, it portrays a situation, in which the
second husband is murdered by the first. At the end of the beautifully
plotted story Ballinger reveals the racial background of the
first-person narrator, the detective pursuing a murderer; he is black.
The plot of <i>The Tooth and the Nail</i> revolves around false money
and faking a murder. The protagonist is a magician, Luis Montana alias
Lewis Mountain, who is pursuing his wife's murderer, Ballard Temple
Humphries. Behind the crime there is a plan to counterfeit money. The
alternating narrative tells about a murder trial, in which the identity
of the accused is kept hidden from the reader. At the end, the reader
learns that the avenger has faked a murder, by leaving in Humphries's
cellar, in the central oven, signs of an apparent crime <font face="Symbol">-</font> a tooth and a nail along other items. Thus
Lewis has successfully framed his opponent and gets his revenge. In
Germany, the title of the book was rendered in 1957 as <i>Die grosse
Illusion</i> (the grand illusion), missing much of the irony of the
whole story &#8211; "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for
hand". Also in the courtroom thriller with lesbian undertones, <span style="font-style: italic;">Not I, Said the Vixen&nbsp;</span> (1965),
Ballinger used multi-leveled narration. Cyrus March is a LA lawyer, who
falls in love with his seductive client, accused of shooting another
woman. The text on the front cover of Fawcett Gold Medal Book says,
that "Even on the witness stand, the one thing she dared not deny was
her own overwhelming sensuality". </p>
      <p>In the 1960s, Ballinger participated in the spy boom producing
a new series characters, CIA operative Joaquain Hawks, a James
Bond-like secret agent, who operated mainly in Southeast Asia. He is
featured in a series mostly "Spy" in the title. Hawks made his entrance
in the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Chinese Mask </span>(1965).
Ballinger depicts carefully everyday life in China, Hawks sees dreams
of his ancestors, and plays a Chinese circus performer. The
resourceful, strong and handsome Hawks is half Spanish and half Nez
Percé Indian, a linguist and smooth killer. Hawks continued his
adventures in four other books, up until <span style="font-style: italic;">The Spy in the Java Sea </span>(1966).
Interestingly, one of the minor themes of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Spy in the Jungle</span> (1965) is
religious <font face="Symbol"> - </font>not ideological <font face="System"><font face="Symbol"> - </font></font>tolerance. Hawks
shows some knowledge of the Swedish philosopher and mystic Emanuel
Swedenborg and Islam, and in Hanoi a Buddhist monk gives him a lecture
on myths. </p>
      <p>Ballinger's later novels include <span style="font-style: italic;">The 49 Days of Death</span> (1969), a suspense
story of reincarnation based on <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead. The
Corsican&nbsp;</i> (1974), published in the wake of Mario Puzo's<i>
Godfather</i> (1969) and the resulting films, told about the growth of
a Union Corse 'family' in Corsica and Marseilles, covering the
three-decade span between 1943 and 1973. Bryce Patch, the chief of
security at a large electronic company, was the hero of <span style="font-style: italic;">Heist Me Higher</span> (1969). </p>

      <p>In the 1950s, Ballinger made his breakthrough as a script
writer.
He wrote for <i>The Mice</i> (with Joseph Stefano), <i>Alfred
Hitchcock Presents</i> (1955-61), <i>I, Spy</i>, <i>Cannon</i>, <i>M.
Squad</i>, <i>Ironside</i>, and <i>Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer</i>,
and <i>The Outer Limit</i>s (1963-64) <font face="Symbol">-</font>
more than 150 television scripts in total. <i> I, Spy</i>, starring
Bill Cosby and Robert Culp, was the first weekly network television
drama to present an African American as a star. Part of the success of
the series was that the stars adlibbed much of their dialogue. The
first episode was set in Hong Kong, but a critic for <i>The New York
Times </i>noted that "the setting was the real star." Ballinger's
television plays included <i>The Hero</i>, <i>Road Hog</i>, <i>Dry
Run</i>, <i>The Day of the Bullet</i>, <i>Escape to Sonoita</i> (with
James A. Howard), and <i>Deathmate</i>. The action film <i>Operation
CIA</i> (1965), starring the young Burt Reynolds as a CIA agent, was
set in Saigon. It was one of the early movies dealing with the politics
and spies of Vietnam war. In <i>The Strangler</i> (1963), directed by
Burt Topper, a hospital laboratory technician Leo Kroll (Victor Buono)
creates frenzy in Boston when he murders nurses who help his mother
(Ellen Corby). When Leo tells her about the last murder, she suffers a
fatal heart attack. Finally Leo's fetish for dolls betrays him to the
police, and he kills himself by jumping through a window. </p>
