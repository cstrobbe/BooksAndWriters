      <p>Czech-French novelist, essayist, dramatist and poet, one of
the major writers of the late 20th century. Milan Kundera's most famous
work
is<i> The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i> (1984), which was also made
into a successful movie. Kundera has brought the novel toward
philosophy and incorporated essayistic elements into his writing,
creating his own concept of the novel as "a feast of many courses." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Conversely, the absolute absence
of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into the
heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only
half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant." </b>(from
        </font><i><font size="2">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Milan Kundera was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech
Republic) into a cultured family. His father, Ludvik Kundera, was a
pianist and musicologist. Kundera was educated at Charles University
and at the Film Faculty of the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts in
Prague. Before becoming ïn 1958 an assistant professor of literature at
the Institute for
Advanced Cinematographic Studies in Prague, he worked as a manual
laborer and as a jazz pianist. His students included Milos Forman and
other creators of the Czech New Wave film movement. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Kundera joined the Communist Party for the first time in 1948,
the year of the communist takeover. He was dispelled in 1950 after
criticizing its totalitarian nature, but in the same year, according to
a document found in 2008, he informed on Miroslav Dvoracek, a former
pilot and purported Western spy, who was later imprisoned for 14 years.
Kundera has rejected the charge. "Communism enthralled me in much the
way Stravinsky, Picasso and Surrealism had," Kundera once said. In
1956, his membership was reinstated, continuing until 1970. </p>
      <p>Until the age of 25, Kundera was more drawn to music than to
literature. His first volume of poetry, <span style="font-style: italic;">&#268;lov&#283;k zahrada &#353;irá</span>,
came out in 1953. <i>Posledni máj</i> (1955) had a positive hero, the
Communist militant and writer Julius Fucik, who was executed by the
Nazis. These works were praised by the official cultural establishment.
Although Kundera's plays were less known in the West, they were highly
regarded in his homeland. <i>The Keepers of the Keys</i> (1962), set
in a provincial town during the German occupation, has been called one
of the most important plays of the post-Stalinist period. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the 1960s,
Kundera grew increasingly uneasy with the policy concerning censorship.
His three series of short stories, <i>Laughable Loves</i> (1963-69),
which dealt with the themes of love, sex, and self-deception, focused
on individual characteristics without attacking directly the system
itself. In his review of the book Paul Theroux noted, that a "writer
who keeps his sanity long enough to ridicule his oppressors, who has
enough hope left to make this ridicule into satire, must be
congratulated."<font size="-1"> (<i>The New York Times</i>, July 28,
1974)</font> </p>
      <p>Kundera was a member of the editorial board of <i>Literární
noviny</i> (1956-59, 1963-68) and <i>Literání listy</i> (1968-69), a
mouthpiece of the Prague Spring. <i>The Joke</i> (1967) was about how
reality takes its
revenge on those who play with it. Published on the eve of
Prague Spring, when the grip of Stalinism weakened for a period, the
novel was his first and most overtly political. <br>
      </p>
      <p>From <span style="font-style: italic;">The Joke</span>
onwards, Kundera's writing became more experimental. After
the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, he was one of the
authors, whose books were removed from libraries and banned from legal
publication. In 1969, Kundera was fired from his teaching post. <span style="font-style: italic;"> Valc&#780;i&#769;k na rozlouc&#780;enou</span> was first
circulated in a samizdat edition in 1970 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Epilog</span>. With some changes it was
first published in France as <span style="font-style: italic;">La
valse aux adieux</span>.
A Czech edition, published by Sixty-Eight Publishers, came out in 1979
with further changes. The publishing house, based in Canada, was owned
by fellow Czech writer and émigre Josef &#352;kvorecký. The novel was first
translated into English by Peter Kussi as <span style="font-style: italic;">Farewell Party</span> and retranslated in
1998 from French by Aaron Asher as&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Farewell&nbsp; Waltz</span>. <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1">"<span style="font-weight: bold;">The struggle
of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting</span>."
(from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Book of Laughter and
Forgetting</span>, 1979) <br>
      </font></blockquote>
      <p>Since
1975, Kundera has lived in France with his wife, Vera
Hrabánková, a musician and composer. Kundera's first post-exile novel was <i>The Book of
Laughter and Forgetting</i>
(1979), written in Czech between 1976-78. It has no linear narrative;
its
structure resembles variations upon a musical theme. Kundera juxtaposes
the laughter of angels with the laughter of the devil; the angels
express their joy of being, whereas the laughter of the devil is
destructive, it proclaimes meaningless. In
his afterword Kundera argued that "evil is already present in the
beautiful, hell is
already contained in the dream of paradise and if we wish to understand
the essence of hell we must examine the essence of the paradise from
which it originated."&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In 1981, two years after the Czech government deprived him
of his citizenship, Kundera became a French citizen. From 1975 to 1980
Kundera worked as a professor of comparative literature at the
University of Rennes. In 1980 he was appointed professor at École des
Hautes Études, Paris. Kundera's many awards include the Writers House
prize (1961, 1969), Klement Lukes prize (1963), Czechoslovak Writers'
Union prize (1968), Médicis Prize (1973), Mondello prize (1978),
Commonwealth award (1984), Europa prize (1982), Los Angeles <i>Times</i>
award (1984), Jerusalem prize (1984), Académie Française Critics prize
(1987), Nelly Sachs prize (1987), Osterrichischeve state prize (1987),
Independent<i> </i>award for foreign fiction (1991). </p>
      <p>Kundera made his international breakthrough with <i> The
Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, set in 1968 Czechoslovakia, just
prior to the Soviet occupation. The protagonist in the story of four
relationships is a Prague surgeon Thomas, who is trapped between love
and freedom, politics and eroticism. At the beginning of the novel
Kundera refers to the myth of eternal return <font face="Symbol">-</font>
a "life which disappears once and for all, which does not return, is
like a shadow, without weight, dead in advance". But if everything
recurs in the same manner ad indefinitum "the weight of unbearable
responsibility lies heavy on every move we make." Kundera asks, which
one is more preferable of the opposing poles, weight or lightness?
Milan Jungmann stated in his essay <span style="font-style: italic;">Kunderian
Paradoxes</span>
(1988) that the work was written with the intention of becoming a
Western bestseller novel because of the erotic content and the
simplification of Czech history. Feminist critics have noted that
Kundera's female characters are either Madonnas or whores, though the
character of the licentious woman is pervasive. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><i>Life
is Elsewhere</i> (1973), Kundera's second novel which was immediately
banned in Czechoslovakia, won the prestigious Médicis Prize. The
original Czech text was published in 1979 by the émigré press run by
Josef &#352;kvorecký, Kundera's friend, who had settled in Canada in 1969.
Again, the central theme is misunderstanding of reality. In the story a
young Communist poet, Jaromir, who is dominated by his mother, becomes
the elated servant of a Stalinist regime, and dies a meaningless death.
Despite political readings of his work, Kundera has refused the label
of "dissident writer" and emphasized the autonomy of art from all
political ideologies. "If you cannot view the art that comes to you
from Prague, Budapest, or Warsaw in any other way than by means of this
wretched political code," Kundera once said, "you murder it, no less
brutally that the worst of the Stalinist dogmatists." </p>
      <p>Kundera has defined the novel as a "poetic meditation on
existence." Like Robert Musil (1880-1942), Kundera uses the genre as a
vehicle for reflections on the essence of the European culture. Kundera
has considered <i>Immortality</i> (1990), which portrays such figures
as Goethe and Hemingway, his most accomplished version of the "novel as
a debate". Noteworthy, the architecture <font face="Symbol">-</font>
or "polyphonic composition" in which the coherence of the work is
achieved through thematic unity <font face="Symbol">-</font> of his
early novels is mostly based on the number
seven. Also Kundera's widely translated collection of essays, <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Art du roman</span> (1987, The
Art of the Novel), was divided into seven parts, as well as
the essay novel <i>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i>. <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Art du roman </span>was his first book
written entirely in French.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p>Dissatisfied with the work of translators, Kundera revised
between 1985 and 1987 the French translations of all his Czech novels
and declared them to be the authentic version of his boy of work.
"Translation is my nightmare," he&nbsp; once said, "I've lived horrors
because of it." Kundera has been criticized for rewriting the
translations and deliberately altering them. <i style="font-style: italic;">Ignorance</i>, about
memory and forgetting, was first published in Spanish in 2000. The
homecoming of two Czech émigrés, Josef and Irena, parallels to the
story of Odysseus, but with a melancholic aftertaste. </p>
