<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Italian novelist, dramatist, and short story writer, whose best-known novel is <i>The Confessions of Zeno</i>
(1923). Svevo published the work at the age of 62 at his own expense.
The novel, dealing with the self-revelations of a nicotine addict, is
considered one of the greatest examples of European experimental
modernist writing. Svevo was killed in an automobile accident.<i> </i><i>Further Confessions of Zeno </i>(1969) appeared posthumously. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Vedere la mia infanzia? Piú di dieci
lustri me ne separano e i miei occhi presbiti forse potrebbero
arrivarci se la luce che ancora ne riverbera non fosse tagliata da
ostacoli d'ogni genere, vere alte montagne: i miei anni e qualche mia
ora."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">La conscienza di Zeno</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Italo Svevo was born in Trieste into a well-to-do Jewish family. He
was one of the seven sons of Francesco and Allegra Schmitz. Svevo's
mother, Allegra Moravia, came from an Italian Jewish family of Trieste;
his father was of German descent, the son of an Austrian customs
official. Svevo attended the Brüssel Institute near Würzburg in
Germany. There he became interested in literature and read German
classics, Schiller, Goethe, Schopenhauer, and great Russian writers of
the time. After returning to Trieste he enrolled in the Instituto
Superiore Revoltella. In 1880 his father, who ran a glassware business,
went bankrupt and also collapsed physically. Svevo was forced to
abandon his studies, but he already planned to become a writer. At the
age of nineteen he started to work in the local branch of the Viennese
Union Bank as a correspondence clerk. This period in his life lasted
nearly twenty years and inspired his novel, <i>Una vita</i> (1893, A Life). </p>
<p>In 1898, after the death of his parents, Svevo married his cousin Livia Veneziani. She was a devoted Roman Catholic 
and under her influence he converted to Catholicism. Livia's family were prosperous manufacturers of marine paint and 
Svevo joined the firm. He traveled much, set up a branch of the firm in England, and eventually took over the management 
of the business after the death of his father-in-law. As a novelist Svevo made his debut with <i>Una vita</i>, which he 
published at his own expense, and using for the first time his pseudonym. The name, "Italus the Swabian," 
reflected his mixed ancestry and cultural background. In the story a young man, Alfonso Nitti, comes to Trieste to 
work as a clerk in a bank. Nitti spends his time in daydreams, has an affair with Annetta, his employer's daughter, 
and escapes from her to his mother, eventually becoming a suicide victim. <i>Una vita</i> went unnoticed. When his 
second novel, <i>Senilità</i> (1898), also failed, he stopped publishing for the next 25 years. 
The original edition was published at Svevo's expense by Vrin in Trieste. "This incomprehension baffles 
me," he admitted. "It demonstrates that they just don't follow me." However, he still 
wrote fables, short stories, plays, a diary, and became a successful businessman. </p>
<p>Svevo's unnoticeable literary pursuits took a new turn in 1907 when he met the young, relatively unknown writer <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>,
who was working as an English teacher in Trieste at the Berlitz School.
Svevo needed a private tutor for the English language and became the
pupil of Joyce, whose works he reviewed. Svevo's wife Livia, with her
reddish-blond hair, inspired the figure of Anne Livia Plurabelle inJoyce's   <span style="font-style: italic;">Finnegan's Wake</span>. <br>
 </p>
<p>The novella <i>Una burla riuscita</i> (1929), about self-deception and passion for writing, 
was the first of Svevo's works published in English. Joyce praised <i>Senilità</i>, 
in which the protagonist, Emilio Brentani, suffers in his thirties from a premature sense 
of senility. Moreover, many Svevo's admirers preferred this novel over <i>The Confessions of Zeno</i>.  Emilio falls hopelessly in love with the young Angiolina, a tall blonde, "with big blue 
eyes abd s supple, graceful body, an expressive face and transparent skin glowing with health." 
The 1927 edition of <i>Senilità</i>, published by Morreale, was considerably edited. 

Its English title, <i>As a Man Grows Older</i>,
was suggested by Joyce. Their friendship lasted until the end of
Svevo's life. Impressed by the the theories of Jung and Freud, Svevo
even started to translate Freud's <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i> with his nephew, a doctor. </p>
<p>In <i>The Confessions of Zeno</i> Svevo's interest in Freud was seen
in his first-person narrator, Zeno Cosini, who writes his autobiography
for his psychoanalyst, Doctor S, to find the origin of his smoking
habit. The ambiguous Italian word of the title, "coscienza", means
either conscience or consciousness. Svevo had begun to write the book
in 1919, and it came out in 1923. Critics and readers ignored it, as
they had done with Svevo's previous novels. Upon the recommendation of
Joyce, it was translated and published by Valery Larbaud and Benjamin
Crémieux in France, where it was hailed as a masterwork. <br>
</p>
      <p><a href="montale.htm">Eugenio Montale</a> wrote about Svevo in his article in <i>L'esame</i> (1925), and persuaded him to republish <i>Senilità</i> and <i>La Conscienza di Zeno</i>.
The Austrian / American literary theorist and critic René Wellek later
stated that Montale grossly overrated Svevo, "if he is evaluated in a
European context. But as an Italian novelist he has permanent appeal as
a psychoanalytical psychologist and as a portrayer of the inhabitants
of Austrian and later Italian Trieste and their often uncertain
national allegiance." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">A History of Modern Criticism</font></i><font size="2">, vol. 8, 1992) </font></p>

<p>Montale's article did not end the debate about Svevo, but only
fuelled more. His critics held the opinion that the book was written in
terrible Italian, and his protagonist was unheroic and commonplace.
Svevo's supporters appreciated his humor, and his effective use of
interior monologue. Zeno's father dies, he smokes again his last
cigarrette, he lies to his doctor, is plagued by a number of
psychosomatic diseases, and has his doubts about self-analysis, saying:
"after practising it assiduously for six whole months I find I am worse
than before." He realizes that there is no cure for life, except a
catastrophe: "There will be a tremendous explosion, but no one will
hear it and the earth will return to its nebulous state and go
wandering through the sky, free at last from parasites and disease." </p>
<p>During the last years of his life, Svevo lectured on his own work, and started to compose a sequel 
to<i> The Confessions of Zeno</i>. In September 1928 he had a car accident at Motta di Livenza. He died a 
few days later, on September 13, 1928, from the shock and a heart condition, from which he had suffered for 
many years. A lifelong heavy smoker, Svevo refused a cigarette on his death bed.</p>
