      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist and
essayist,
whose masterpiece is&nbsp;<em>Journal d'un curé de campagne</em> (1936,
The Diary of a Country Priest). Bernanos was not a priest but he is
considered one of the most original Roman Catholic writers of his time.
He believed that heroic&nbsp;innocence, not technological advances or
political parties, will save the world at the end.&nbsp;Unlike many
contemporary French writers, Bernanos was a supporter of the rightist
Action Française movement and the French monarchy.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Je me disais donc que le monde est
dévoré par l'ennui. Naturellement, il faut un peu réflechir pour se
rendre compte, </b></font><b><font size="2">ça ne se saisit pas tout
de suite. C'est une espéce de poussière. Vous allez et venez sans la
voir, vous la respirez, vous la mangez, vous la buvez, et elle est si
fine, si ténue qu'elle ne craque même pas sous la dent. Mais que vous
vous arrêtiez une seconde, la voilà qui recouvre votre visage, vos
mains. Vous devez vous agiter sans cesse pour secouer cette pluie de
cendres. Alors, le monde ságite beaucoup." </font></b><font size="2">(in
        </font><i><font size="2">Journal d'un curé de campagne</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Georges Bernanos was born in Paris, the son of Émile Bernanos,
an interior decorator, and Hermance Moreau, a pious and meditative
woman, who from early on steered her son&nbsp;in the direction of the
priesthood. As a child Bernanos spent his vacations in&nbsp;the
family's&nbsp;spatial country house in Fressin, in Pas-de-Calais, the
setting of many of his works. Bernanos's father read&nbsp; Édouard
Drumont's anti-Semitic&nbsp;newspaper <em>La Libre Parole.</em>
Drumont's&nbsp; views had a lasting influence on Bernanos, who once
said that his anti-Semitism was "not a whimsical idea or an
intellectual viewpoint, but a great political concept."<font size="2"> (<span class="st"><em>Bernanos: His Political Thought &amp; Prophecy</em> by
Thomas Steven Molnar, 1997, p. 17.) </span></font></p>
      <p>Bernanos studied at the Collège des Jésuits, Collège
Notre-Dame-des-Champs (1901-1903), Collège Saint-Célestin, Bourges
(1903-04), and Collège Sainte-Marie, Aire-sur-la-Lys. During
his&nbsp;years in the dark, stinking,&nbsp;and heartless religious
schools&nbsp;Bernanos developed a&nbsp;profound aversion for the
Jesuits. After giving up the idea of becoming a priest, he entered
Sorbonne, receiving in 1909 a license in both law and literature. At
the age of 20, he joined the Camelots du Roi,&nbsp; the militant youth
organization of the Royalist <em>Action française</em>. After a street
riot,&nbsp;he spent some time in La Santé prison in Paris.<strong> </strong>From
1909 to 1910 he was in the military service. In 1913-14 Bernanos edited
      <i>L'Avant-Garde de Normandie</i>, a roaylist weekly, where he
met his future wife, Jeanne Talbert d'Arc.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><span class="st">Upon the outbreak of World War I,</span>&nbsp;Bernanos
enlisted in the Sixth Dragons Regiment in the French army. He witnessed
the battles of Somme and Verdun, was wounded several times, and
decorated for bravery.&nbsp; In the trenches he constantly
scribbled&nbsp;in his notebooks, and then crossed out what he had just
written. (<span class="st"><font size="2"><em>Bernanos: An Ecclesial
Existence</em> by </font><font size="2">Hans Urs Von Balthasar, 1996,
p. 62.)</font> </span>While convalescing in Vernon, he&nbsp;discovered
the&nbsp;work of&nbsp;Léon Bloy, a prominent figure of French
Catholicism. Bloy considered writing a divine calling and his thoughts
influenced deeply Bernanos. </p>
      <p>In 1917 Bernanos married Jeanne Talbert d'Arc; they had three
sons and three daughters. Talbert was a direct descendant of Saint Joan
of Arc through her brother. Joan's character inspired&nbsp;
Bernanos's&nbsp;essay from 1929, 'Jeanne, relapse et sainte' (Joan,
Heretic and Saint), in which true meaning and vitality of the Saint's
message is contrasted with&nbsp;bourgeois spirituality. </p>
      <p>After the war, Bernanos worked as an inspector for an
insurance company until 1927. Most of his major fiction Bernanos wrote
in a period of barely twelve years, between 1926 and 1937. Like a
number of French writers, from Joris-Karl Huysmans to François Mauriac
and Julien Green, Bernanos wrestled with Catholicism throughout his
literary career. His first novel, <em>Sous le soleil de Satan</em><strong>
      </strong>(1926),&nbsp;came out&nbsp;when he was 38 years old. It
was followed by&nbsp;<em>L'Imposture</em> (1927), about the spiritual
crisis of a prominent member of the Parisian clergy, and&nbsp; <em>La
Joie</em> (1929), its sequel. </p>
      <p>From 1930 to 1932 Bernanos was a columnist for <i>Le Figaro</i>.
His fervent Catholism entered into conflict with his royalist beliefs
when <i>Action Française</i>, for which he started to write as a
student, was condemned by the Vatican. In 1932 he broke off all
contacts with the movement and Charles Maurras, its leader.
This&nbsp;painful decision marked one of Bernanos's most bitter crises.
When Maurras was elected to the French Academy in 1938, Bernanos
denounced him in <em>Scandale de la vérité</em> (1939).&nbsp;Much of
the last twelve years of his life Bernanos devoted himself to writing
polemical essays and articles. Turning away from fiction,
he&nbsp;campaigned against&nbsp;barbarism which he saw approaching and
pleaded for a new spiritual and moral integrity. </p>
      <p>Although&nbsp;Bernanos was well known figure, his writings did
not bring the family financial security. In 1933 he became disabled in
a traffic accident,&nbsp;but he refused to have morphine or any other
strong pain-killer to dull his pain.&nbsp; Because of debts, he was
evicted from his family home. He moved with his wife and six
children&nbsp;to Palma de Mallorca,&nbsp;staying there between the
years 1934 and 1937. Moreover, living in Mallorca was also cheaper than
in France.&nbsp;By the end of 1936 he had completed all but the final
chapter of his last novel,&nbsp;<em>Monsieur Quine</em> (1943). </p>
      <p>In 1938 Bernanos&nbsp;went with his family, relatives and
friend to Paraguay, and continued then&nbsp;into self-imposed exile to
Brazil, where he spent seven years.&nbsp;Bernanos lived in many places,
the longest sojourn was near Barbacena, a small place called Cruz de
Almas. With his radio addresses, broadcast via the BBC, he became one
of the spiritual voices of the Resistance back in France. After the
war, he returned to&nbsp;his home country&nbsp;at the request of
Charles de Gaulle, his former classmate, but for his disappointment, he
did not find any signs of spiritual renewal. </p>
      <p>However, Bernanos did not lack followers. <a href="bresson.htm">Robert Bresson</a>'s film adaptation of <i>Journal
d'un curé de campagne</i> (1951, Diary of a Country Priest
) won at the twelfth annual Venice International Film Festival the
Golden Lion. Bresson also adapted for the screen
Bernanos's&nbsp;pre-war novel <em>Nouvelle histoire de Mouchette</em>
(1937),&nbsp;about an adolescent girl,&nbsp;"the bride of hell", who
lives in a shack with her family, is beaten by his father, bullied at
school, and raped&nbsp;by a&nbsp;poacher. "And yet Bresson has the
magical ability to show us humanity, humor, and grace surviving in
Mouchette's soul," said Roger Ebert in his review. (<font size="2"><em>Roger
Ebert's Four-Star Reviews, 1967-2007</em> by Roger Ebert, 2008, p.
513.) </font><font size="3">The film, which premiered in 1966, was not
released in the US until 1970. </font></p>
      <p><em>Diary of a Country Priest</em>&nbsp;is set in an ugly and
indifferent parish in northern France. The central character is an
enthusiastic but an inexperienced priest (Claude Laydu), whose attempts
to introduce extreme versions of Christianity lead to tragic
consequences. The character was partly inspired by Thérèse de Lisieux,
a Carmelite nun, who died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-four.
"His innocence wins out over all before he dies peacefully of cancer,"
Bernanos explained in a letter. Bresson recounts, through the
pages of a diary, the daily life of a young priest, his self-doubts and
the problems of his small parish at Ambricourt in the province of the
Pas-de-Calais. He is upset that no one comes to Mass. The villagers
wrongly suspect that he is greedy and an alcoholic. However, in his own
despair he is able to bring spiritual peace to a dying countess, who
has long rejected God. He ultimately dies alone, painfully of stomach
cancer, murmuring '"All is Grace". Thérèse de Lisieux's final words
were "Grace is everywhere." </p>
      <p>Bresson wrote the scenario himself and used the literary
device of first person narrative or interior dialogue. He also used
non-actors, natural sound, and real locations. Claude Laydy, playing
the&nbsp;tortured priest, lived for a time in a monastery to achieve
the thinness required for the role and to accustom himself to clerical
behavior. The unused script written by Pierre Bost and Jean Aurenche
was a standard work, which took liberties with the novel. The writers
concluded the film with a minor character's cry, "When you're dead
everything is dead," instead of Bernano's "What does it matter, all is
grace." François Truffaut, Bresson's young protégé, criticized later in
      <i>Cahiers du Cinéma </i>('A Certain Tendency in French Cinema')
the rejected scenario of Bost and Aurenche; they couldn't write a good
script because Bernanos was alive. And Bresson had said that if the
writer had been alive, he would have taken more liberties. Bresson
himself protested later in <i>The New York Times</i> the cuts made by
the American distributor. </p>
      <p>Bernanos gave lectures in Switzerland, Belgium, and North
Africa, and contributed to many journals, including <em>Carrefour</em>,
      <i>La Bataille,</i> <i>L'Intransigeant,</i> and <i>Combat</i>,
edited for some time by Albert Camus.&nbsp;His last years Bernanos
lived in Tunis and in France. He died of cancer on July 5, 1948, at the
American Hospital in Neuilly. Bernanos was buried in the family vault
in Pellevoisin. Shortly before his death Bernanos completed <span class="st"><em>Dialogues des Carmélites</em></span>, a&nbsp;dramatic
scenario&nbsp;telling the story of&nbsp;sixteen nuns imprisoned and
executed&nbsp;during the French Revolution.&nbsp;The scenario was based
on <em>Die Letzte am Scafott</em> (Song at the Scaffold) by the German
poet and novelist Gertrud von le Fort.&nbsp; Bernanos's work was
adapted for the stage in 1952 and it&nbsp;was the basis for the
libretto of Francis Poulenc's famous opera&nbsp; <em>Dialogues of the
Carmelites</em>, first performed in 1957. </p>
      <p>As an essayist, Bernanos moved from right-wing nationalism to
an undefinable political position, where both communists and the
extreme-right could occasionally agree with him. He denounced Francisco
Franco's dictatorship in Spain, appeasement in Munich, France's
armistice with Germany, and the cruel aftermath of the liberation in
1944. For Bernanos writing was a divine calling,&nbsp;to
defend&nbsp;both Christian civilization and advocate his mystical
vision of an "ancienne France". In the essay 'Joan, Heretic and Saint'
he wrote Joan of Arch: "Just when the old man raises a finger to set a
thousand typist in action, just when the peace of the world is about to
emerge from all this machinery, in comes a young girl, mocking and
tender, who belongs to no one, and whose soft voice answers the
political theologians with old sayings and proverbs, after the manner
of shepherds. The democratic abbes of the illustrious University of
Paris, with their dream of some sort of universal republic; the
distinguished pacifist prelates, dazzled by the dollar rate and
impressed by the solidity of the good Burgundian coins; the Carmelite
Eustache, making up to the Communist flayers of the Butchers'
Corporation; the graduates of the Rue Clos-Bruneau; the clerics of the
Rouen Chapter and those of the Chapter of M. Julie Benda&nbsp;&#8211; all
these old men, many of them under thirty, look enviously at this little
France who is so fresh, so mischievous, who is awfully afraid of being
burnt, but still more afraid of telling a lie." </p>
      <p>Bernanos's central works his later period include <i>Diary of
My Times </i>(1938), and <i>Plea for Liberty</i> (1942). His wartime
essays, written in Brazil, where he worked at one point unsuccessfully
as a farmer, gained him a reputation as "bard of the French
Resistance". Bernanos's vision of France's destiny to lead the whole
postwar world in a spiritual revolution won him audience, but he made
no serious attempts to fuse his ideals with political realities. He had
once stated: "The most dangerous of our calculations are those we call
illusions." A determined anti-American&nbsp;through his literary
career, he never abandoned the view that&nbsp;American
liberalism,&nbsp;and its perfected democracy and technology, are a
major threat to France's spiritual vocation. He argued that "the Modern
State, the Technological Moloch, in erecting the solid foundations of
its future tyranny, remained faithful to the old liberal vocabulary,
covering or justifying with that liberal vocabulary its innumerable
ususpations." Before making his dystopic <em>Alphaville</em> (1965),
the director Jean-Luc Godard re-read Bernanos's <em>La France contre
les robots</em> (1944, Tradition of Freedom); there is even an entire
sentence from the book in the film. </p>
