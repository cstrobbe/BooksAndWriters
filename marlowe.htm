<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Elizabethan poet, dramatist, <A href="../../../shakespe.htm">William 
Shakespeare</A>'s predecessor in English drama. Christopher Marlowe was killed at the age of 29 in a tavern broil by Ingram Frizer, and buried at St. Nicholas, Deptford. His dramatic career lasted only six years. And as we all know, the English-born mystery writer <A href="rchandle.htm">Raymond Chandler</A> lent Marlowe's name to his own hero Philip Marlowe.</P>

<FONT size=2>(from 'The Passionate Shepherd to His Love', c. 1589) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Christopher Marlowe (Cristofer Marley in his autograph) was born in Canterbury, the son of a shoemaker. He attended the King's School, which had a strong tradition in theatrical productions,&nbsp;and was awarded a scholarship from the foundation of Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury. Marlowe studied the Bible and the Reformation theologians as well as philosophy and history at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In 1584 he graduated with a A.B. and continued as an M.A. student.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Instead of&nbsp;staying in Cambridge, Marlowe left his studies to carry out a secret mission for the government. When university authorities, believing he had been converted to Catholicism, were first unwilling to grant his M.A.,&nbsp;the Queen's Privy Council interceded on Marlowe's behalf, the dispute was settled, and he finally graduated with the degree he wanted. It did not help him either, that he had been away too much from his studies. </P>
<P>After moving to London, Marlowe&nbsp;established his fame as a dramatist. He made important friends, including Sir Walter Raleigh, who had started the first colony in Virginia, and who was contending with the Earl of Essex of Queen's favours. Most likely Marlowe began writing on leaving Cambridge. His first dramas were composed in blank verse. It is assumed that the first part of his <EM>Tamburlaine the Great</EM> was performed in London in 1587. In the play Tamburlaine burns the <I>Koran </I>and after conquering the world he wants to conquer the heavens. </P>
<P>In 1589 Marlowe was charged with the murder of William Bradley and sent to Newgate Prison, but acquitted 12 days later. Thomas Watson, who had assisted him, is eventually released under self-defense. It was not the last time when the quick tempered author was arrested and jailed. In 1592 an injunction was brought against him because of a street fight, in which a man was killed. Marlowe was also deported from Netherlands for counterfeiting gold coins.</P>
<P>Numerous plays have been assigned to Marlowe. Unfortunately, Marlowe neglected to publish authoritative texts, and his literary remnants consist much of incomplete works. However, his blank verse, written with great intensity, and villain-heroes <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT><FONT face=Symbol></FONT> a new type on the English stage <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> influenced deeply the theatre of his time. The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909) observed of Marlowe that "the father of English tragedy and the creator of English blank verse was therefore also the teacher and the guide of Shakespeare." Shakespeare and Marlowe both wrote plays for Lord Strange's acting company and influenced each other's work. Also Shakespeare favored the blank verse. </P>
<P>Marlowe's major plays were written between 1585 and 1593, among them <I>Tamburlaine</I>, Parts I and II, and <EM>The Jew of Malta</EM>, a tragedy and parody of Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). Machiavelli <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> or Machiavel as Marlowe calls him <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> is portrayed as the embodiment of political manipulator. "If one takes <I>The Jew of Malta</I> not as a tragedy, or as a "tragedy of blood," but as a farce, the concluding act becomes intelligible; and if we attend with a careful ear to the versification, we find that Marlowe develops a tone to suit this farce, and even perhaps that this tone is his most powerful and mature tone." <FONT size=2>(T.S. Eliot in <I>Selected Essays</I>, new edition, 1960)</FONT> </P>
<P><EM>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</EM>&nbsp;drew on the medieval legend of the bargain with the Devil. "Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters," says Faustus in the beginning of the play, "Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires." Eventually, after making his pact with the Devil and finding only empty answers to his questions, the tragic hero rejects black magic and calls upon Christ to save him. Marlowe himself was a soulmate of Faustus, accused of atheism. </P>
<P><EM>Edward&nbsp;the Second</EM>&nbsp;was a historical tragedy in blank verse and Marlowe's last play. Later it has inspired <I>Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England</I> (1924) by Bertolt Brecht and Lion Feuchtwanger, Derek Jarman's film from 1991, which presented a homosexual relationship between the king and Piers Gaveston, Edward's proteg&eacute;, and David Bintley's Ballet-Edward II (1995). Marlowe's plays were produced by the Earl of Nottingham's Company. He also wrote poetry, including<EM> Hero and Leander</EM>, based on&nbsp;work by the sixth-century poet Musaeus,<STRONG> </STRONG><EM>The Passionate Shepherd</EM>, and translated Ovid's <I>Amores</I>.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"Marlowe's </B></FONT><B><I><FONT size=2>Doctor Faustus</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, like Goethe's </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Faust</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, finds himself before the specter of Helen (the idea that Helen of Troy was a ghost or apparition is already present in the ancients) and says to her, "Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss." And then, "O thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars." He does not say "evening sky," but "evening air." All of Copernican space is present in that word air, the infinite space that was one of the revelations of the Renaissance, the space in which we still believe, despite Einstein, that space that came to supplant the Ptolomaic system which presides over Dante's triple comedy." </FONT></B><FONT size=2>(Jorge Luis Borges in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>The Total Library</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1999) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Marlowe's mysterious death in Deptford in Eleanor Bull's house <FONT face=Symbol>- </FONT>nominally about who should pay the bill <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> may have had a political cause. Accusations of atheism, blasphemy, subversion and homosexuality, also burdened his public image. When Marlowe died, he was under a shadow of charges of atheism. His former roommate and fellow dramatist, Thomas Kyd, had declared under torture that a document denying the divinity of Christ belonged to Marlowe. And Richard Baines contributed two notorious statements to Marlowe: "St John the Evangelist was bedfellow to Christ and leaned always in his bosom, that he used him as the sinners of Sodoma," and "That all they that love not Tobacco &amp; Boies were fooles". Marlowe's connections saved him from imprisonment. The author might have worked as a government's secret agent according to <A href="../../../burgess.htm">Anthony Burgess</A>. Possibly while still at university, he became an agent of Sir Francis Walsingham (c. 1530-90), a statesman and a Puritan sympathizer, in the secret service of Elisabeth I and a favorite of Walsingham's brother, Thomas. </P>
<P>Research suggests he was murdered by an agent of Francis Walsingham, for reasons unknown. According to Charles Nicholl <FONT size=2>(</FONT><I><FONT size=2>The Reckoning The Murder of Christopher Marlowe</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1994)</FONT>, supporters of the Earl of Essex could have been behind the death. Scholars are still attempting to reconstruct the events. In the common version it is concluded, that after eating and drinking together in a tavern in Deptford, on Wednesday, May 30, 1593, Marlowe and his friend Ingram Frizer began to wrangle over payment of the bill. Marlowe wrenched Frizer's dagger from its sheath, and struck him twice about the head with it. In the struggle Frizer got the weapon. According to the coroner's inquest, "And so it befell, in that affray, that the said Ingram, in the defence of his life, with the dagger aforesaid of the value of twelve pence, gave the said Christopher a mortal wound above his right eye." The dagger went in just above the right eye-ball. </P>
<P>A week earlier a warrant had been issued for the author's arrest. Marlowe was buried two days later in an unmarked grave. His killer pleaded self-defense and received a pardon from the Queen. This has partly confirmed the thesis of a political intrigues. Marlowe's life have been the theme of the tragedies <I>Death of Marlowe</I> by Richard H. Horne (1837) and <I>Kit Marlowe</I> by W.L. Courtney (1890). <FONT size=2></FONT>In the Oscar winning film, <I>Shakespeare in Love</I> (1998), directed by John Madden, Shakespeare believes that he has caused the death of his colleague. 
</P>
<P>Marlowe's violent&nbsp;end was not something that exceptional among writers. In 1599 the playwright John Day apparently killed the playwright Henry Porter, and the famous dramatist Ben Jonson killed the well-known actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel. As a both spy and a writer, Marlowe was a representative of a long tradition, continued through Ben Jonson and Daniel Defoe to such modern day writers <A href="../../../greene.htm">Graham Greene</A>, <A href="../../../lecarre.htm">John Le Carr&eacute;</A>, John Dickson Carr, <A href="../../../maugham.htm">Somerset Maugham</A>, Alec Waugh and Ted Allbeury.</P>
