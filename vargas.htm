<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Peruvian novelist, playwright,
essayist and literary critic, who received Nobel Prize for Literature
in 2010. Mario Vargas Llosa is one of the central writers in the
Hispanic world, but he began his literary career in Europe. Most of his
novels are set in Peru. From his first works, Vargas Llosa has used a
wide variety of avant-garde techniques to create an aesthetic "double
of the real world." Although Vargas Llosa has followed the tradition of
social protest of Peruvian fiction exposing political corruption,
machismo, racial prejudices and violence, he has underlined that a
writer should never preach or compromise artistic aims for ideological
propaganda. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"His voice was persuasive; it
reached a person's soul without passing by way of his head, and even to
a being as addlebrained as Big João, it seemed like a balm that healed
old and terrible wounds. João stood there listening to him, rooted on
the spot, not even blinking, moved to his very bones by what he was
hearing and by the music of the voice uttering those words. The figure
of the saint was blurred at times by the tears that welled up in João's
eyes. When the man went on his way, he began to follow him at a
distance, like a timid animal." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The War of the End of the World</font></i><font size="2">,
1981) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Mario Vargas Llosa was born in Arequipa, but from ages one to
then he lived in Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he was brought up by his
mother and maternal grandparents after his parents separated. However,
Vargas Llosa once said, that "I feel very much an Arequipan". He also
spent some time in Piura, northern Peru (1945-46), where his
grandfather had been appointed as Prefect, and then in Lima. When he
was about eight years old his parents reconciled. </p>
      <p>Vargas Llosa attended Leoncio Prado Military Academy
(1950-52), and Colegio Nacional San Miguel de Piura (1952). In 1955 he
married Julia Urquidi; they divorced in 1964. From 1955 to 1957 Vargas
Llosa studied literature and law at the University of San Marcos. He
then attended graduate school at the University of Madrid, from where
he received his Ph.D. in 1959. Vargas Llosa's doctoral dissertation
about <a href="marquez.htm">García Márquez</a> (1971) was followed by
several books on literary criticism, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">La orgía perpetua</span> (1975), about <a href="flaubert.htm">Flaubert</a>'s masterpiece <i>Madame Bovary</i>.
Decades later, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Travesuras de la
niña mala</span> (2006), he drew on the character of Emma. With Julio
Cortázar, Carlos Fuentes, and García Márquez, Vargas Llosa was among
the most famous writers, whose aim was to revitalize the Latin American
novel. </p>
      <p>In the 1950s, while still a student, Vargas Llosa worked as a
journalist for <i>La Industria</i>. He was a coeditor of the literary
journals <i>Cuadernos de Conversación</i> and <i>Literatura</i>, and
journalist for Radio Panamericana and <i>La Crónica</i>. His first
collection of short stories, <span style="font-style: italic;">Los
Jefes</span> came out in 1959. "I liked Faulkner but I imitated
Hemingway", he said later. Vargas Llosa moved to Paris because he felt
that in Peru he could not earn his living as a serious writer. Although
the boom of Latin American fiction in the 1960s opened doors to some
authors for commercial success, the great majority of Peruvian writers
suffered from the problems of the country's publishing industry. </p>
      <p>In France Vargas Llosa worked as Spanish teacher, journalist
for Agence-France-Presse, and broadcaster for Radio Télévision
Française in early 1960s. From the late 1960s Vargas Llosa worked as a
visiting professor at many American and European universities. In 1965
he married Patricia Llosa; they had two sons and one daughter. García
Márquez became a godfather to his son, but after a brawl in a Mexican
cinema in 1976, the friendship of two writers ended bitterly. However,
in 2006 Vargas Llosa allowed an excerpt from his <span style="font-style: italic;">Historia secreta de una novela</span>
(1971) to be published in the 40th anniversary edition of García
Márquez's <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>. In 1970 Vargas Llosa
moved to Barcelona and five years later he settled back in Peru, ending
his self-imposed exile. Vargas Llosa was a member of the 1976 Cannes
Film Festival jury, led by Tennessee Williams; Martin Scorsese's <i>Taxi
Driver</i> won that year's Palme d'Or. In 1977 he was elected President
of PEN Club International. The military dictatorship, which started in
1968 when General Francisco Morales Bermudez took over the country,
ended in 1980. </p>
      <p>Vargas Llosa was a conservative candidate (Fredemo, the
Democratic Front) for the Peruvian presidency in 1990. The development
of his political convictions, from a sympathizer of Cuban revolution to
the liberal right, has astonished his critics and has made it
impossible to approach his work from a single point of view. Sabine
Koellmann has noted that the publication of Vargas Llosa's<span style="font-style: italic;"> La Fiesta del Chivo</span> (2000, The
Feast of the Goat) confirmed, "that politics is one of the most
persistent 'demons' which, according to his theory, provoke his
creativity." <font size="2">(</font><font size="2">see </font><font size="2"><i>Vargas Llosa's Fiction &amp; the Demons of Politics</i>,
2002) </font>Vargas Llosa was defeated by Alberto Fujimori, an
agricultural engineer of Japanese descent, also a political novice, but
who had a more straightforward agenda to present to the voters. An
unexpected twist in the plot of this political play occurerred in 2000,
when President Fujimori escaped to his ancestral homeland Japan after a
corruption scandal.</p>
      <p>From 1991 to 1992 Vargas Llosa worked as a visiting professor
at Florida International University, Miami and Wissdenschaftskolleg,
Berlin. In addition to the Nobel Prize, the author has received many
other honors. Among the most notable are Leopoldo Alas Prize (1959),
Rómulo Gallegos Prize (1967), National Critics' Prize (1967), Peruvian
National Prize (1967), Critics' Annual Prize for Theatre (1981), Prince
of Asturias Prize (1986) and Miguel de Cervantes Prize (1994). </p>
      <p>Vargas Llosa made his debut as a novelist with <span style="font-style: italic;">La ciudad y los perros</span> (1962, The
Time of the Hero), set in Leoncio Prado military Academy, where he had
been a student. The book received an immediate international
recognition. According to Vargas Llosa's theory, personal, social or
historical daemon gives a meaning to a novel and in the writing process
unconscious obsessions are transformed into a novelist's themes.
Autobiography and art has been one of the themes in his criticism. </p>
      <p>One of Vargas Llosa's own obsessions is the conflict between a
father and son, which he has approached from the private level or from
more universal or social levels. <i>The Time of the Hero</i> is a
microcosm of Peruvian society. The murder of an informer is buried due
to the codes of honor to protect the academy's reputation. <span style="font-style: italic;">La tía Julia y el escribidor</span> (1977,
Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter) is a partly autobiographical story of
a courtship and marriage, written with uninhibited humor. The
tyrannical father threatens to shoot his son, a novelist named Marito
Varguitas, in the middle of the street, because of his marriage to the
sexy, sophisticated, older Aunt Julia. Marito is eighteen and the
marriage is illegal. Eventually his father accepts the situation. The
book started to live its own life when Aunt Julia, Vargas Llosa's first
wife, wrote a reply to it. </p>
      <p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">La casa verde</span>
(1966, The Green House) Vargas Llosa returned to formative experiences
of his childhood and youth. The complicated novel has two major
settings: the first, a provincial city, and the second, the jungle, a
challenging, hostile and attractive environment, which the author has
depicted in several works. In 1957 Varga Llosa travelled with a group
of anthropologists into the jungle, and learned how Indian girls were
being drafted into prostitution on the coast. The "Green House" of the
story is a brothel, which is burned to the ground but rebuilt again.
Another storyline follows the fate of the virginal Bonifacia from a
jungle mission; she becomes a prostitute in Piura. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">La guerra del fin del mundo</span>
(1981, The War of the End of the World) is a story of a revolt against
the Brazilian government in the late 19th-century and the brutal
response of the authorities. A religious fanatic, known as Conselheiro
(Counselor), is followed by a huge band of disciples drawn from the
fringes of society. Before the army of the Republic wins, the modern
rational world suffers several humiliating defeats with the group of
outcasts. Vargas Llosa uses Euclides da Cunha's account of the events, <i>Os
sertões</i> (1902), as a source. One of the characters, a "nearsighted
journalist", is loosely based on da Cunha. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Historia de Mayta</span>
(1983, The Real life of Alejandro Mayta) moves on several narrative
levels. It deals with a failed Marxist-Leninist insurrection in the
Andes, led by an aging Trotskyist Alejandro Mayta. He is captured and
his second lieutenant Vallejos executed. The novelist-narrator
interviews a number of people who give a contradictory view of Mayta's
personality and the events. Finally the reader realizes that in the
process of creating a novel within a novel, the narrator has invented
Mayta's life and undermined the concepts of writing and reading
history. </p>
      <p>Besides fiction, Vargas Llosa has publushed a large body of
essays, criticism, and literary and political journalism. A writer with
an international readership, his foreign reportage has appeared in <i>The
New York Times</i> <i>Le Monde</i>, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>,
      <i>El País</i>, and other influential newspapers. Vargas Llosa's
articles about the war in Iraq,
written for <i>El Pais</i>, were collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Diario de Irak</span> (2003). With his
daughter Morgana, a photographer, he traveled to Israel and Palestine
in 2005, and recorded his impressions in <span style="font-style: italic;">Israel/Palestina. Paz o guerra santa</span>
(2006). The book was received with mixed reactions among the Jewish
community in South America. "Israel had become a powerful and arrogant
country, and it is the role of its friends to be highly critical of its
policies", Vargas Llosa said in an interview. </p>
      <p>Vargas Llosa's bitter memoir,<span style="font-style: italic;">
El pez en el agua</span> (A Fish in the Water), appeared in 1993. It
focused on his run for the presidency in 1990 &#8211; he was supposed to win
the little-known Alberto Fujimori. <i>The Feast of the Goat</i>
continued the author's political excursion into the recent history of
South America. The story is set in the Dominican Republic in 1961,
ruled by the dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Urania Chabral has
returned to the noisy Santo Domingo to visit her father, Agustin
Chabral, who is ill. He is a former Dominican senator, a faithful
servant of the dictator. "And how many times did you come home saddened
because he did not call to you, fearful you were no longer in the
circle of the elect, that you had fallen among the censured?"
Eventually "Minister Cabral, Egghead Cabral" lost his favor. Urania
left the country as a schoolgirl, three and a half decades ago, just
before Trujillo's assassination in 1961. Urania wants revenge against
father for everything he did not do, and has her own reasons to examine
the Trujillo Era. "The most important thing that happened to us in five
hundred years. You used to say that with so much conviction. It's true,
Papa. During those thirty-one years, all the evil we had carried with
us since the Conquest became crystallized." </p>
      <p>Vargas Llosa portrays Trujillo as a superman intoxicated by
his political and sexual powers, and worshipped by his demonic henchmen
working in torture dungeons. "Oddly, Vargas Llosa's Trujillo sees
himself as having gotten the short end of the bargain. He whipped his
pathetic homeland into shape, modernized its attitudes and highways and
in return he got -- old."<font size="2"> (Walter Kirn in the </font><i><font size="2">New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, November 25, 2001)</font>
Vargas Llosa has structured the story like a thriller, leading the
reader into the heart of the darkness. <i>The Feast of the Goat </i>is
a highly topical book. The era of strong leaders is not totally over in
Latin America, as one of the latest examples, Fujimori, sadly proved. </p>
      <p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">El paraíso en la otra
esquina</span> (2002) two exceptional individuals, the socialist Flora
Tristan, and her grandson, the painter Paul Gauguin, are inspired by
great ideas. Flora devotes her life to serve the humanity, to create a
worker's paradise. Gauguin leaves civilization behind and eventually
rots alive in Atuana, Marguesas Island, in a tropical paradise. <span style="font-style: italic;">El sueño del celta</span> (2010) again
portayed an idealist, Sir Roger Casement, a diplomat and an Irish
nationalist, who revealed human rights abuses in Congo&nbsp;and Peru,
and was executed in 1916 by the British for treason. </p>
