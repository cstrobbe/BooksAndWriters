<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American writer, particularly acclaimed for her stories which combined comic with tragic and brutal. Along with authors like <A href="../../../carsonmc.htm">Carson McCullers</A> and Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor belonged to the Southern Gothic tradition that focused on the decaying South and its damned people. O'Connor's body of work was small, consisting of only thirty-one stories, two novels, and some speeches and letters. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"Does one's integrity ever lie in what he is not able to do? I think that usually it does, for free will does not mean one will, but many wills conflicting in one man, Freedom cannot be conceived simply."</B> (in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Wise Blood,</FONT></I><FONT size=2> 1952) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Mary Flannery O'Connor was born in Savannah, Georgia, the only child of a 
Catholic family. The region, part of the 'Christ-haunted' Bible and its spiritual heritage shaped profoundly O'Connor's writing as described 
in her essay 'The Catholic Novelist in the Protestant South' 
(1969): "The South impresses its image on the Southern writer from the moment he is able to distinguish one sound from another." O'Connor's father, Edward F. O'Connor, was a realtor owner. He 
worked later for a construction company and died in 1941. Her mother, 
Regina L. (Cline) O'Connor, came from a prominent family in the state&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> her father had been a mayor of Milledgeville for many years. </P>
<P>Opposite the O'Connors' three-story Georgian row&nbsp;house was the French Gothic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, which gave rise to the often-repeated comment, that Flannery O'Connor "was conceived in the shadow of the cathedral". When&nbsp;she was 12,&nbsp;the family moved to Milledgeville, her mother's 
birthplace. She attended the Peabody High School and enrolled in the 
Georgia State College for Women. At school she edited the college magazine and 
graduated in 1945 with an A.B. Before devoting himself to what he held most dear: writing, O'Connor spent a great deal of her youth drawing pictures and for a period she considered a career as a cartoonist. </P><P>O'Connor continued her studies at 
the University of Iowa, where she attended writer's workshops conducted by Paul Engle. At the age of 21 she published her first short story, 
'The Geranium', in <I>Accent</I>. In the following year she 
received the degree of Master of Fine Arts in Literature. In 1947 she lived for seven months at Yaddo, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., an estate left by the Trask family for writers, painters and musicians. </P>
<P>O'Connor 
published four chapters of <I>Wise Blood</I> in <I>Mademoiselle</I>, 
<I>Sewanee Review</I>, and <I>Partisan Review</I> in 1948 and 1949. 
The complete novel&nbsp;came out&nbsp;1952. It dealt with a young religious 
enthusiast, who attempts to establish a church without Christ. The Signet paperback version of the book advertised it as "A Searching Novel of Sin and Redemption". O'Connor's 
second novel, <I>The Violent Bear It Away</I> (1960), had a related 
subject matter. The protagonist is Francis Marion Tarwater,&nbsp;who begins his ministry in his youth. He baptizes and drowns Bishop, his uncle's idiot son. Old Tarwater warns his grand-nephew: "'You are the kind of boy,' the old man said, 'that the devil is always going to be offering to assists, to give you a smoke or a drink or a ride, and to ask you your bidnis. You had better mind how you take up with strangers.'" Young Tarwater sets fire to his own woods to clean himself, and like his great-uncle, a mad prophet, he finally becomes a prophet and a madman. O'Connor once explained that "I can write about Protestant believers better than Catholic believers&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> because they express their belief in diverse kinds of dramatic action which is obvious enough for me to catch. I can't write about anything subtle."<B><FONT size=2> </FONT></B><FONT size=2></FONT>
</P>
<P>The young protagonist of <I>Wise Blood</I>, Hazel Mote, returns from 
the army with his faith gone awry. He founds the Church Without Christ, 
wears a preacher's bright blue suit and a preacher's black hat. 
He is accompanied by bizarre villains. Asa Hawks pretends to 
have blinded himself. Sabbath Lily, his daughter, turns into a 
monster of sexual voracity. The fox-faced young Enoch Emery steals from a museum a mummy, which he thinks of as "the new 
jesus." Enoch knows things because "he had 
wise blood like his daddy." Eventually Enoch finds his 
religious fulfillment dressed in a stolen gorilla costume. Hazel buys an 
old Essex automobile, his own religious 
mystery: "Nobody with a good car needs to be 
justified." <B><FONT size=2></FONT></B>Haze murders the False Prophet, his rival, 
by running over him with his second-hand Essex, and faces his cul-de-sac. </P>
<P>John Huston read the novel in 1978&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> he had received a copy of it from Michael Fitzgerald, whose father was O'Connor's literary executor. Against all odds, Michael Fitzgerald got the money for the production, some $2,000,000; the screenplay was written by Michael and his brother, Benedict, and everyone worked for a minimum wage. Most of the film was shot in Macon, Georgia.<B> </B>"There were seven outstanding performances in <I>Wise Blood</I>. Only three of those seven actors have any reputation to speak of: Brad Dourif, Ned Beatty and Harry Dean Stanton. The other four are unknowns. They are all great stars, as far as I'm concerned. Nothing would make me happier than to see this picture gain popular acceptance and turn a profit. It would prove something. I'm not sure what... but something."<FONT size=2> (John Huston in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>An Open Book</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1988) </FONT><BR>

    In 1950 O'Connor suffered her first attack from disseminated lupus, 
a debilitating blood disease that had killed her father. She returned to 
Milledgeville where she lived with her mother on her dairy farm. In spite of the illness, 
O'Connor continued to write and occasionally she lectured about creative 
writing in colleges. "I write every day for at least two hours," she&nbsp;told in an interview, "and I spend the rest of my time largely in the society of ducks." In 1953 O'Connor met a young Danish student, Erik Langkjaer. Their relationship ended when&nbsp;he returned to Europe. On their farewell ride, he kissed her, and later recalled that he had "a feeling of kissing a skeleton". Erik became infatuated with a Finnish woman, and eventually&nbsp;married the daughter of an actor. O'Connor's letters to him were tender.&nbsp; </P><P>"I am making out fine in spite of any conflicting stories,"&nbsp;O'Connor&nbsp;said to Robert Lowell. "I have enough energy to write with and as that is all I have any business doing anyhow, I can with one eye squinted take it all as a blessing. What you have to measure out, you come to observe more closely, or so I tell myself." She read such thinkers as Pierre 
Teilhard de Chardin (1881-195), George Santayana (1863-1952), and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975). </P><P>In New York&nbsp; O'Connor befriended with Robert and Sally Fitzgerald, 
two other literary Roman Catholics. She lived and wrote in their house in Ridgefield, Connecticut until illness redirected her life in 1951. O'Connor named Robert Fitzgerald as her literary executor. He selected and edited with his wife a volume of O'Connor's occasional prose, which was published in 1969 under the title <I>Mystery and Manners</I>. </P>
<P>From around 1955 O'Connor was forced to use crutches. An abdominal 
operation reactivated the lupus and O'Connor died on August 3, 1964, 
at the age of 39. Her second collection of short stories,<I> Everything 
That Rises Must Converge</I>, was published posthumously in 1965. 
<I>The Complete Short Stories</I> (1971) contained several&nbsp;works that had not previously appeared in 
book form. O'Connor's letters, published as <I>The Habit of Being</I> 
(1979), reveal her conscious craftsmanship in writing and the role of 
Roman Catholicism in her life.</P>

<P>O'Connor's short stories have been considered her finest work. 
With <I>A Good Man Is Hard to Find, and Other Stories </I>(1955) she 
came to be regarded as a master of the form. The cover art of the 1956 Signet paperback edition featured an encounter with a man in a dark suit and voluptuous woman. In the title story a grandmother, her son 
and daughter-in-law and their three children, are on a car journey. 
They encounter an escaped criminal called the Misfit and his two killers, Hiram and Bobby Lee. 
The family is casually wiped out by them when the grandmother recognizes the Misfit from his ''Wanted'' poster. The hallucinating grandmother murmurs: "Why you're one of 
my babies. You're one of my own children!" The Misfit shoots her and 
says: "She would of been a good woman if it had been somebody there 
to shoot her every minute of her life." </P>
<P>'A View of the Woods' was a violent and perhaps pointless tale of the seventy-nine-year-old Mr. 
Fortune and his nine-year-old granddaughter, Mary Fortune Pitts, both 
selfish and mean. The story ends in a fight. The grandfather smashes Mary's head several times against a rock, killing her. 
Exhausted, he manages to take a few steps, has a final "view of the woods," and dies of a heart attack. </P>

<P>In the story "Good Country People" a young woman with a sense of moral superiority experiences her downfall. The protagonist, Joy Hopewell, has an artificial leg as a result of a hunting accident. She has a Ph.D. in philosophy and she has changed her name legally from Joy to Hulga. Joy-Hulga tries to seduce a Bible salesman, a simple-seeming country boy, with the obvious phallic name of Manley Pointer. He turns out to be another 'Hazel Motes' and disappears with her artificial leg. "The Artificial Nigger" is a lesson about injustice.&nbsp;</P><P>O'Connor's short stories have not so strong theological basis as her novels. They often focus on grotesque characters, have a crisp humor, and are open to interpretation. Recurrent images include the flaming suns, mutilated eyes, peacocks&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> she raised them in Milledgeville&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> colorful shirts, and bright blue suits and stern black hats of preachers. Like Victorian writers, she avoided overt treatment of the sexuality of his characters. "Mr Truman Capote makes me plumb sick, as does Mr. Tenn. Williams," she wrote in a letter. Once she protested, "As for lesbianism I regard that as any form of uncleanness. Purity is the twentieth centuries dirty word but it is the most mysterious of the virtues." </P>
