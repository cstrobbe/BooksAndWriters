<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American short-story writer and poet, a
major force in the revitalization of the short story in the 1980s.
Carver's reputation continued to grow after his death at the age of
fifty. Robert Altman's much praised film <i>Short Cuts</i> (1993) was
based on several of Carver's stories. His short fiction is often placed
in the realistic tradition of Stephen Crane and Ernest Hemingway and
its post-modern version, called minimalism. Carver himself did not like
the label, because it "smacks of smallness of vision and execution." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I love the swift leap of a good
story, the excitement that often commences in the first sentence, the
sense of beauty and mystery found in the best of them; and the fact &#8211;
so crucially important to me back at the beginning and now still a
consideration - that the story can be written and read in one sitting.
(Like poems!) </b></font> <font size="2">(from foreword in </font><i><font size="2">Where I'm Calling From</font></i><font size="2">, 1998)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Raymond Carver was born in Clatskanie, a mill town on the
Columbia River in Oregon. His father, Clevie Carter, a sawmill worker,
was an alcoholic. At home he used to tell him stories about his own
hunting and fishing exploits, and about his grandfather, who had fought
in the Civil War, for both sides. In 'Elephant', one of Carver's best
stories, the narrator recalls his father nostalgically. On the other
hand, 'Nobody Said Anything' tells about a young boy, who becomes the
target of his father's frustration. Carver's mother, Ella Beatrice,
worked as a waitress or as a retail clerk or else stayed home. </p>
      <p>Carver was educated at a local school in Yakima, Washington.
On his spare time read mostly Mickey Spillane's novels, or<i> Sports
Afield</i> and <i>Outdoor Life</i>. After graduating in 1956, he
married his high-school girlfriend, the sixteen-year-old Maryann Burk.
She was pregnant and just graduated from an Episcopalian private school
for girls. When her second child was born, she was eighteen. After
graduating from Davis High school, Carver supported his family by
working as a janitor, laborer at a sawmill and salesman. During their
marriage, Maryann worked as a waitress, salesperson, and administrative
assistant and teacher. Usually she earned more than he did. Their
children had a rough childhood but eventually both become college
graduates. </p>
      <p>Carver became interested in writing in California, where he
had moved with his family - his wife's parents had a home in Paradise.
Carver attended a creative-writing course, and was taught by John
Gardner. Later he said that all his writing life "he had felt Gardner
looking over his shoulder when he wrote, approving or disapproving of
certain words, phrases and strategies." <font size="2">(Carver's
former student Jay McInerney in </font><i><font size="2">The New York
Times</font></i><font size="2">, August 6, 1989)</font> Carver
continued his studies first at Humboldt State College in California,
receiving his B.A. in 1963, and at the University of Iowa. Before
Humboldt he attended Chico State University; later Chicoans started to
arrange a Raymond Carver festival. At Palo Alto at Science Research
Associates he worked as a textbook editor until he was fired in 1970.
In the 1970s Carver taught for several years at universities throughout
the United States. From 1980 to 1983 he was a professor of English at
Syracuse University. </p>
      <p>While still at Humboldt, Carver published his first story,
'Pastoral,' in the <i>Western Humanites Review,</i> and his first
poem, 'The Brass Ring,' in <i>Targets</i>, which also had a poem by
Charles Bukowski. During these years of working in different jobs,
rearing kids, and trying to write, Carver started to drink.<b> </b>"Alcohol
became a problem. I more or less gave up, threw in the towel, and took
to full-time drinking as a serious pursuit."<font size="2"> (from </font><font size="2"> </font><font size="2"><i>Writers at Work.</i>, ed. by
George Plimpton, 1986</font><font size="2">)</font> In 1967 his story
'Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?' was selected for the anthology <i>Best
American Short Stories</i>, edited by Martha Foley. In the fall
semester of 1973, Carver was a teacher in the Iowa's Writers' Workshop
with John Cheever, but later he said that they did nothing <i>but </i>drink.
Not too long after leaving Iowa City, Cheever went to a treatment
center, but Carver continued drinking for some years. Alcohol was a
subject in several stories, among others in such as 'Chef's House,' 'A
Serious Talk,' 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,' in which
an elderly couple drinks in their kitchen, 'Vitamins,' about a man who
do not realize that he has a drinking problem, and 'Where I'm Calling
From,' in which the narrator has ended up in an alcohol rehabilitation
center. </p>
      <p>Carver's first collection of short stories, <span style="font-style: italic;">Put Yourself in My Shoes</span>, came out
in 1974. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Will Yoy
Please Be Quiet, Please? </span>(1976) which established his
reputation and introduced his central themes. "Most prevalent among
these constants is the isssue of love," Kirk Nesset wrote in <i>The
Stories of Raymond Carver </i>(1995), "or, more precisely, the issue
of love and its absence, and the bearing of love's absence on marriage
and individual identity." The title story of the book was was nominated
for a National Book Award. <span style="font-style: italic;">What We
Talk About When We Talk About Love</span> (1981) contained seventeen
stories. "[Carver] has done what many of the most gifted writers fail
to do," said Michael Wood in <i>The New York Times Books Review</i>.
"He has invented a country of his own, like no other except that very
world, as Wordsworth said, which is the world to all of us." </p>
      <p>In his prose Carver mixed the simple clarity of Chekhov with
the ominous tones of Franz Kafka. "It is possible to write a line of
seemingly innocuous dialogue and have it send a chill along the
reader's spine &#8211; the source of artistic delight, as Nabokov would have
it. That's the kind of writing that most interests me."<font size="2"> </font><font size="2">(Carver in <i>The New York Times</i>, </font><font size="2">February
15, 1981</font><font size="2">) </font>Gordon Lish, an editor at
Esquire and then at Alfred A. Knopf, later told that he had a crucial
role in the creation of these early works, but Carver never
acknowledged in public his debt to Lish. However, in <i>Writers at
Work </i>(1986) Carver praises Lish's skills: "... he is remarkably
smart and sensitive to the needs of a manuscript. He'
s a good editor. Maybe he's a great editor. All I know for sure it that
he's my editor and my friend, and I'm glad on both counts." Among these
stories, which Lish edited, constantly cutting out talks about
feelings, were 'Mr. Coffee and Mr. Fixit,' 'Fat,' and 'Tell the Women
We're Going.' </p>
      <p> Carver's works appeared in a number of the volumes of the <i>Best
American Short Stories </i>and <i>The <a href="ohenry.htm">O. Henry</a>
Prize Stories</i>. On June 2, 1977 Carver stopped drinking with the
help of Alcoholics Anonymous. His doctor had warned, that he would die
if he did not stop drinking. After this 'line of demarcation' Carver's
stories became increasingly more expansive. In 1982 Carver divorced
Maryann. From 1979 Carver had lived with the poet Tess Gallagher
(b.1943), they had met at a writers' conference in Dallas. They married
in 1988. The wedding took place in Reno. Two months later, on August 2,
1988, the author died of lung cancer. Selection of his short fiction, <span style="font-style: italic;">Where I'm Calling From</span>, appeared
posthumously in 1988. After writing its last story, 'Errand,' about
Chekhov's death, Carver learned that he had cancer. </p>
      <p>Carver received several awards, among them The National
Endowment for the Arts award in fiction (1980) and Guggenheim
fellowship (1979-80). In 1983 he was recipient of the "Mildred and
Harold Strauss Livings", which was conferred by a special panel of the
American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. </p>
      <p>Much of what Carver wrote about was based on his own
experiences in the Pacific Northwest. "... everything we write is, in
some way, autobiographical," he has said. Carver depicted the quiet
desperation of the white- and blue-collar workers, salesmen,
waitresses, and their sense of betrayal and unableness to express
themselves. Things are frequently left unspoken and conflicts
unresolved, and the meaning of the story is only revealed through
implications.</p>
      <p>Carver's prose is often muted, even anticlimactic, but the
atmosphere is tense, reminding the mood of <a href="kafka.htm">Kafka </a>or
      <a href="hpinter.htm">Harold Pinter</a>. Rejecting the more
experimental fiction of the 60s and 70s, Carver became one of the
leading figure among so-called 'dirty realists' &#8211; for their gritty
depictions of everyday life &#8211; with Richard Ford, Tobias Wolff, Ann
Beattie, and Jayne Anne Philips. In 'Neighbors,' from<i> Where I'm
Calling From</i>, the Millers, who take care of their neighbors'
apartment while the couple is away, find the apartment more attractive
than their own, although it don't differ much from it. In 'Why Don't
You Dance?' a man whose marriage has failed, sells his furniture at the
front yard. A young couple shows some interest in them and dance
together in the driveway at the man's suggestion. The surfaces of
Carver's stories look calm and banal, but especially his portrayals of
marriage problems are full of emotional tension, hidden memories,
wounds, longing, hate, anxiety, and melancholy.</p>
      <p>Carver's poetry was written in the vernacular lyric-narrative
mode of William Carlos Williams and Charles Bukowski. Although Carver
began as a poet, he once confessed that he is not a "born" poet, and
when he had to make a choice, he came down on the side of fiction.
However, in 1984 Carver returned to Pacific Northwest and published two
collections of poetry, <span style="font-style: italic;">Where Water
Comes Together with Other Water</span> (1985) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ultramarine</span> (1986). He shared the
1985 Levinson Prize for these books. </p>
