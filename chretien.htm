      <p>12th-century French poet, known for his five Arthurian
romances. Chrétien de Troyes's <i>Perceval</i>,
of which 9,234 lines survived, is the earliest extant narrative of the
legend of the Holy Grail. The poem was left unfinished. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Thus largess makes the gentleman,
which
result can be accomplished neither by high birth, courtesy, knowledge,
gentility, money, strength, chivalry, boldness, dominion, beauty, or
anything else. But just as the rose is fairer than any other flower
when it is fresh and newly blown, so there, where largess dwells, it
takes its place above all other virtues, and increases five hundred
fold the value of other good traits which it finds in the man who
acquits himself well."</b> (from </font><font size="2"><i>Cligès</i>,
c. 1176</font> </blockquote>
      <p>Little is known of Chrétien de Troyes's life. It is possible
that he
was educated as a cleric, although the content of his romances is not
especially religious even in<i> Perceval</i>, dealing with the quest
for the Grail. Moreover, the chivalric conception of love, which
Chrétien advocated, was not really in tune with the Church's
requirement of chastity. </p>
      <p>Chrétien's narration is effortless and confident and does not
give
the impression that the author himself was a starving poet, who lives
by his pen. Developing a style as free-flowing as his required writing
lots of drafts and a good supply of writing material, parchment
probably. </p>
      <p>Chrétien has been associated with the town of Troyes, the
court of
the count of Champagne and a centre for the Templars, whose activities
nourished the Grail legend. During literary career Chrétien worked in
eastern France under the patronage of Countess Marie de Champagne
(1145-1198), and under Philippe d'Alsace, Count of Flanders
(1141-1191). Marie de Champagne also sponsored Andreas Capellanus, the
writer of <i>The Art of Courtly Love</i>. Chrétien found the story of
the Grail in a manuscript supposedly given to him by Philippe. If he
attended the courts of Champagne and Flanders, he paid no attention to
their political activities, like other contemporary chronicles writing
in Latin. His major concern was the celebrated Round Table. Basically 
Chrétien was an entertainer, whose world of beauty and
miracles was removed from the reality of his own time and place.
      </p>
      <p>Chrétien mastered Latin, the lingua franca of the educated
elite.
His translations of Ovid are lost, possibly because only a few copies,
if any, was made of the work. Also at least two songs, 'Amors tençon et
bataille' and 'D'Amors, qui m'a tolu a moi,' has been assigned to him.
From Chrétien's own writings we can conlude, that he had both knowledge
of classical literature and the literature of his own time. Much of his
material originated from Celtic legends prevalent in Brittany. The
style of his romances, written in vernacular, is elegant, light and
easy. In the thematic core of is the idea of courtly love, a romance
between a knight and a noblewoman, who is married. </p>
      <p>Although Chrétien used occasionally Christian symbols, he drew
very
little from the Bible. Noteworthy, his characters do not cherish the
bourgeois virtues of thrift and prudence, but courage, honor, and
refined manners. Written expressly for the courtly society, Chrétien's
romances were high quality luxury products. The superiority of nobility
over townsmen is most clearly expressed in <i>Guillaume d'Angleterre</i>,
a non-Arthurian story, which is in some sources credited to Chrétien.
Generally this adaptation of the Saint Eustace legend is considered the
work of a rather gifted imitator. </p>
      <p>For later writers, Chrétien provided fascinating characters, a
treasury of motifs,
and a new way to look at the romances, a sort of code for the portrayal
of the Arthurian world. His poems remained popular for a long period
after his death,
and influenced the legends of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round
Table. These stories were well-known in France through the
pseudo-chronicle <i>Historia regum Britanniae</i> by Geoffrey of
Monmouth (1138). The Norman poet Wace translated Geoffrey's work into
French under the title <i>Roman de Brut</i> (1155) and also enlarged
it. Though after the mid-1300s, Chrétien's romances were no longer
recopied and his name vanished, his influence was still strong. In
Germany his achievement was replaced by Wolfram von Eschenbach's <i>Parzival</i>
(1200-12), and in England Sir Thomas Malory's
      <i>Le Morte Darthur </i>(1469-70).&nbsp; Chrétien's romances
were rediscovered in the fifteenth century, and turned into prose to
suit the tastes of the growing mass of readers.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> <i>Erec et Enide,</i> written circa 1170, was most likely
the first
of Chrétien's long poems. The tale of a impoverished noblewoman, Enide,
who is married to Erec, a knight of the Round Table, was based on oral
tradition. Enide's marriage is threatened by her husband's search of
adventures, but she proves her love for him by disobeying his commands.
      </p>
      <p><i>Cligès</i> has a wide setting from Greece and
Constantinople to the court of King Arthur and Germany. Probably it was
modeled in part on Thomas's <i>Tristan</i>,
written between 1150 and 1165, whose heroine Chrétien criticized. In
the beginning of the story the writer refers to himself: "The clerk who
wrote the tale of Erec and Enid, and translated the Commandments of
Ovid and the Art of Love, and composed the Bite of the Shoulder, and
sang of King Mark and of the blonde Iseult, and of the metamorphosis of
the Hoopoe and of the Swallow and of the Nightingale, is now beginning
a new tale of a youth who was in Greece of the lineage of King Arthur."
      <font size="2">(translated by L.J. Gardiner)</font> </p>
      <p>In <i>Lancelot</i> the famous knight chooses love over
loyalty to
his king, but before the legendary adulterous affair his horse is
killed. Lancelot is forced to travel in the cart of a peasant, a great
humiliation, which he endures stoically. "Whoever was convicted of any
crime was placed upon a cart and dragged through all the streets, and
he lost henceforth all his legal rights, and was never afterward heard,
honoured, or welcomed in any court." It has been assumed, that the
story was finished by Godefroy de Lagny, but why Chrétien did not do it
himself is an open question. In <i>Yvain</i> a knight of the Arthur's
court kills another knight at a magic spring and wins the love of the
widow. A Swedish verse translation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yvain</span>,
entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Herr Ivan Lejonriddaren</span>,
was commissioned by the Norwegian Queen Eufemia in 1303, probably as a
present to her son-in-law to be, the Duke Erik Magnusson of Sweden, at
his betrothal and wedding to her daughter, the Princess Ingeborg. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Chrétien's sixth romance, which he refers to having written,
is
lost. Chrétien mentions that he composed <i>Perceval, the Story of the
Grail</i>,
for Count Philip of Flanders, whom the poet called "the most excellent
noble / in the Holy Roman Empire." The hero is the son of the "Widowed
Lady," who meets on his wanderings an enigmatic fisherman &#8211; the
mysterious Fisher King &#8211; in whose castle he is invited. There he sees
the bleeding white lance (the Holy Lance of Longinus) carried
ceremoniously across the hall, and the Grail, which has been worked
with the purest gold and set with the most precious stones. The hero do
not ask the vital question, "what is the Grail," and after the banquet
he wakes up in an empty room, alone. </p>
      <p>The story of Grail, or Sangreal, has a pagan origin. It is
assumed
to be derived from the miraculous Celtic cauldron of plenty and
regeneration, which could restore the dead to life.¹ Possibly this
Celtic myth also found expression in the form of Sampo, the magic
device in the Finnish national epic <a href="kalevala.htm">Kalevala</a>.
      <br>
      </p>
      <p>In Wolfram's <i>Parzival</i>, one of the famous versions of
the story, the essence of
Grail is that of "lapsit exillis," a precious stone that makes a man so
vigorous that his bones and flesh recover their youth instantly.
According to some scholars, the phrase could be a corruption of "lapis
elixir," the fabulous Philosopher's Stone of alchemy. In <i>Le Morte
Darthur </i>the sacred relic is described as a "vessel of gold"
containing "part of the blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ." In <i>Perceval</i>
Chrétien do not directly say what the <i>graal</i> is, but the
mysterious object can described in the context of the scene as a plate
or a dish of some kind. Since its birth, the Grail quest have captured
people's imagination for centuries, even until today. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Similarities between the Templars and the Knights of the Grail
were
not coincidental. In Troyes, where Chrétien worked, the court of the
count of Champagne had maintained close connections with the Order
since 1124, when the Count became a Templar in 1124, after making two
journeys to the Holy Land. In Wolfram's <i>Parzival</i> the Knights
Templar guard the Holy Grail, the Grail castle and the Grail family.
Starting from the effects of the Crusades, the circumstances, that
contributed to the atmosphere of orthodox and heretical mysticism in
the twelfth century, were favourable both to the spread of Arthurian
legends and the growing influence of the Templars, surrounded by
secrets and mysteries. </p>
      <p><i>Perceval</i> was written about at the same time or just
before
the Third Crusade (1189&#8211;1192) took place. Chrétien died before
finishing his work, which eventually had four continuators. It has been
speculated that the poet of courage, honor, and loyalty participated in
the crusade and perished in the plague that swept through army.
However, if Chrétien was born in the 1130s, he would have been
relatively old for the hardships of the journey &#8211; at that time he life
expectancy was averaging 25 to 35 years. Many documents were lost in a
great fire in 1188 in Troyes and the year of Chrétien's death is
unknown.</p>
      <p>¹<font size="2">Jessie L. Weston has rejected this derivation
in</font><i><font size="2"> From Ritual to Romance</font></i><font size="2"> (1920). It was one of the scholarly works that inspired T.S.
Eliot's poem </font><i><font size="2">The Waste Land </font></i><font size="2">(1922). </font></p>
