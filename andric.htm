<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Writer of Serbo-Croatian novels
and short stories who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1961. Ivo Andric's literary career spanned some 60 years. Before World
War II, he was known primarily for short stories set in his native
Bosnia. Andric made his reputation as a novelist with the Balkan
trilogy (<i>The Bridge on the Drina, Bosnian Chronicle</i>, and <i>The
Woman from Sarajevo</i>), which appeared practically simultaneously in
1945.&nbsp;Its central&nbsp;symbol was the bridge.&nbsp;Andric's work,
dominated by a sense of Kierkegaardian pessimism and personal
isolation, arise from the collision of cultures in the Balkans. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Here, where the Drina flows with
the whole force of its green and foaming waters from the apparently
closed mass of the dark steep mountains, stands a great clean-cut stone
bridge with eleven wide sweeping arches. From this bridge spreads
fanlike the whole rolling valley with the little oriental towns of </b></font><b><font size="2">Vi&#353;egrad and all its surroundings, with hamlets nestling in
the folds of the hills, covered with meadows, pastures and
plum-orchards, and criss-crossed with walls and fences and dotted with
shaws and occasional clumps of evergreens. Looked at from a distance
through the broad arches of the white bridge it seems as if one can see
not only the green Drina, but all that fertile and cultivated
countryside and the southern sky above."</font></b><font size="2">
(from </font><i><font size="2">The Bridge on the Drina</font></i><font size="2">, 1945, translated by Lovett F. Edwards)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Ivo Andric was born in the village of Trávnik in Bosnia (then
in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), into a middle-class family. Andric was
three years old when his father, an artisan, died of tuberculosis. The
family moved then to Vi&#353;egrad, where he was raised by his mother, a
strict Roman Catholic, and his aunt. A Croat by birth, he became a
Serbian by choice. He was educated at schools in Vi&#353;egrad and Sarajevo
in 1898-1912. While at secondary school, he read <em>Don Quixote</em>
and became interested in the work of August Strindberg. At the age of
nineteen, Andric published his first poem, entitled 'U sumrak', in <i>Bosanska
vila</i>. </p>
      <p>In his youth Andric joined the revolutionary nationalist
student organization <i>Mlada Bosna </i>(Young Bosnias), which was
involved between 1912 and 1914 in a dozen terrorist plots of sabotage.
However, another passion of the Young Bosnians was literature. Andric
transferred from the university of Zagreb to the university of Vienna
in 1913. After showing the first signs of tuberculosis&nbsp; he asked
to be allowed to leave Vienna for Cracow. Possibly&nbsp;Andric was
motivated by political reasons, too. When Gavrilo Princip, a member of
the group, assassinated Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria and his
wife in Sarajevo in 1914, Andric was arrested as a conspirator and
imprisoned and interned in various places until the Amnesty of 1917.
His time Andric devoted to reading the works of <a href="fdosto.htm">Fedor
Dostoyevsky</a> and <a href="kierkega.htm">Søren Kierkegaard</a>,
whose&nbsp;<em>Either/Or</em> (1843) had a great influence on him. </p>
      <p>In 1918 Andric co-founded the journal <i>Knjizveni jug</i>,
which published several of his poems. Other early literary efforts
included also translations of Walt Whitman and of Strindberg. His prose
poems Andric collected in <em>Ex Ponto</em> (1918) and <em>Nemiri</em>
(1920). Beginning with the short story 'Put Alije Djerzeleza' (1920,
The Journey of Alija Djerzelez), Andric turned his attention to prose
and in the late 1920s he had given up poetry for fiction, focusing on
short stories, which was the most appropriate form of expression for
him. Much of the material for his stories, which could be called
chronicles, came from the cultural heritage and centuries long struggle
among the Yugoslavian peoples, Orthodoxs, Caltholics, Jews, and
Muslims; Catholic characters were portrayed more often than Orthodox.
In an essay, 'Conversation with Goya' (1935), he said: "There are a few
fundamental legends of humanity which indicate or at least cast some
light on the path we have travelled, if not on the aim we are pursuing.
The legend of The Fall, the legend of the Flood, the legend of the Son
of Man crucified to save the world the legend of Prometheus and the
stole fire . . ." </p>
      <p>After World War I Andric completed his studies in the field of
Slavic languages and literatures, receiving a doctorate in 1924 with a
thesis on the cultural history of Bosnia under Turkish domination. From
1920 to 1940 he was at the Yugoslavian diplomatic service first
representing the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovens, which became
Yugoslavia in 1929. His posts included the Vatican, Geneva, Madrid,
Bucharest, Trieste, Graz, Belgrade, Marseilles, Paris, Brussels, and
Berlin, as ambassador to Germany.</p>
      <p>In the 1920s and 1930s Andric published only a few collections
of stories, each titled&nbsp; <em>Pripovetke</em>&nbsp;(Stories). His
first collection was awarded a prize by the Serbian Royal Academy. In
1926&nbsp;Andric himself&nbsp;was elected to the Acamedy.
After&nbsp;World War II&nbsp;appeared <span class="st"><em>Nove
pripovetke </em></span>(1948) and <em>Prokleta avlija</em> (1954, The
Devil's Yard), in which prison inmates break out from their
circumstances by telling stories. Much of his
fiction&nbsp;was built around prominent characters, such as the monks
Fra Petar and Fra Marko, the peasant Vitomir Tasovac, the brave Muslim
Alija, and the Vi&#353;egradian jack-of-all-trades Corcan. The protagonist
are depicted in the different periods of their life. <i>The Devil's
Yard</i> was structured as a&nbsp; complex series of frame stories many
of which were told by inmates of a natorious Turkish prison. </p>
      <p>Following the outbreak of WWW II,&nbsp;Yugoslavia allied
herself to Germany. Andric&nbsp;asked in a letter to the Minister of
Foreign Affairs to be relieved of his duties. After the Nazi invasion
of Yugoslavia in 1941, he spent the war years writing in the occupied
Belgrade under German house arrest. "In the worst moments of my life I
have found unusual and unexpected consolation in imagining another
life," he wrote in his notebook in 1939, "the same as mine in dates,
names and events, but true, bright, pure; painful of course as every
life on earth must be, but without any dark or ugly in that pain; a
life which begins with a blessing and is lost in the heights and
extinguished in light. " In seclusion, Andric produced his major works,
      <em>Na Drini cuprija</em> (The Bridge on the Drina), the story of
the famous bridge at Vi&#353;egrad in eastern Bosnia,&nbsp; <em>Travnicka
hronika</em> (Bosnian Chronicle), set in the town of Trávnik during the
period 1806-13, and&nbsp;<em>Gospodjica</em> (The Woman From Sarajevo),
a moral tale about a well-to-do old maid and her pathological love of
money. </p>
      <p><i>The Bridge on the Drina</i> is Andric's most famous work,
which offer a novelistic overview of Bosnian history between 1516 and
1914. The beautiful 16th-century stone bridge and the river have
symbolic significance. They connect or separate generations of
townsfolk, Muslims, Christians, and Jews, who are engaged in a
ceaseless struggle against forces of nature and human restrictiveness.
Through the metaphor of the bridge, the embodiment of endurance, Andric
urged his readers to try to overcome their differences and live in
harmony. </p>
      <p>Andric structured the novel as a series of vignettes, each one
presenting some aspect of life in the town from the time of the
bridge's construction to its partial destruction at the outbreak of
World War I. The author's personal history also is closely associated
with the bridge connecting East and West. It is mirrored in the story
of Mehmed Pasha Sokolli, who was taken from his Serbian mother by the
Turks when he was a little boy and eventually became a vizer. Passing
of time and fragility of human achievements label often Andric's work
with a sad tone &#8211; only stories remain: "In a thousand different
languages, in the most varied conditions of life, from century to
century... the tale of human destiny unfolds, told endlessly and
uninterruptedly by man to man," Andric has written.<i> Bosnian Chronicle</i>
was an exploration of clash of cultures, in which European consuls and
a Turkish vizer confront. The story spans the seven-year period, when
the Dalmatian littoral fell under French rule in the aftermath of
Napoleon's bloody campaigns. </p>
      <p>In the postwar socialist period Andric's output included
several short stories on contemporary subjects and themes, some travel
memoirs, a number of essays on writers and painters, and two shorter
novels. In 1949 he was elected to Yugoslavia's federal assembly as a
representative for Bosnia. A supporter of Yugoslav Premier Josip Tito,
Andric joined the Communist Party and served as president of the Union
of Yugoslav Writers. During the period from the late 1940s to the early
1950s Serbian writers debated on modernism and realisms, and the
stuggle ended in the victory of the modernists. Yugoslavia&nbsp;adopted
the socialist system, but followed an independent policy, and socialist
realism never took root in the country. Andric enjoyed in his own
country a great acclaim, and was the most widely translated Serbian
writer &#8211; only from the younger generation Miodrag Bulatovic's works
arose neatly as much interest abroad. </p>
      <p>In 1958, at the age of 66,&nbsp;he married Milica Babic, a
costume-designer at the National Theatre. They had ten happy years
together before Milica died in 1968.&nbsp; Andric won in 1961 the&nbsp;
the Nobel Prize for Literature over names such as Lawrence Durrell,
Robert Frost, Graham Greene, EM Forster and JRR Tolkien. When he was
asked, what he is going to do, he replied that he&nbsp;is not
accustomed to all the excitement around him, and he&nbsp;just waits to
get back to his "ordinary, monotonous working day."&nbsp;Andric went to
Greece and Egypt, but he was taked ill in Cairo, and due to health
problems he refused invitations to visit the United States, France and
Poland, among other countries. The remainer of his life Andric spent in
Yugoslavia, where he was honored with the Prize for Life Work, an
annual national award. Andric continued to work until 1974, when he
became seriously ill. He died in Belgrade on March 13, 1975. </p>
