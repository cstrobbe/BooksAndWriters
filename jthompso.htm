<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American novelist and screenwriter, best
known for his paperback pulp novels dealing with the criminally insane.
Thompson knew that he was not destined for big success, but before he
died he told his wife to protect his manuscripts and copyrights,
anticipating posthumous fame. He was right, ten years after his death.
Thompson's dark, violent view of the world has inspired such filmmakers
as Sam Peckinpah, Stephen Frears, Bertrand Tavernier, and Quentin
Tarantino. </p>
<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>"I've loafed streets sometimes, leaned against a store front with my hat pushed back and one boot hooked back around the other </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><font size="-1"><b> hell, you've probably seen me if you've ever been out this way </b></font><font size="-1"><b> </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211; </font><font size="-1"><b>I've
stood like that, looking nice and friendly and stupid, like I wouldn't
piss if my pants were on fire. And all the time I'm laughing myself
sick inside. Just watching the people."</b> (from <i>The Killer Inside Me</i></font><font size="2"><font size="-1">, 1952)</font> </font></blockquote>
<p>James Meyers (Jim) Thompson was born in Anadarko,
Oklahoma, the son of  James Sherman Thompson, the sheriff of Caddo County, and Birdie Myers Thompson, a schoolteacher.
Later he claimed that he saw daylight first in the Caddo County Jail,
but actually he was born over the cell block in a comfortable sheriff's
apartment. His father, "Big Jim" as he was
called, was a colorful figure. He foiled jail-breaks,
rode with some of the most celebrated Western peace officers, and
arrested horse thieves. He also was a chronic gambler and was in 1907
dismissed for misappropriating funds. Avoiding arrest, he fled to
Mexico. For the next 14 years he traveled from one oil field to another
with his family, and managed to acquire a fortune by 1919 before going
bankrupt. In 1921 he suffered a breakdown and died in an institution 20
years later. </p>
<p>For the disappointment of his father, Thompson was in his childhood
shy, bookish, and hated sports. After graduating from Polytechnic High
School in Fort Worth, he held numerous jobs &#8211; beginning as an oil well
and pipeline worker in the West Texas oil fields, gaining at the same
time weight and muscle. When he returned to Fort Worth he stood six
feet four inches and weighted 240 pounds. While being enrolled at the
University of Nebraska, Lincoln, contributed to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Prairie Schooner</span>. <br>
</p>
      <p>During the Depression Thompson
became affiliated with the Federal Writers
Project in Oklahoma, helping to turn out guidebooks of the state. He also contributed to "true crime" magazines. In this period,
when trading in liquor was illegal, Thompson got to know the local
gangsters, losers, deputies, corrupt civil servants, and later depicted
their world in his books. In 1931 he married Alberta Thompson; they had
two children. He also joined the Communist party and made friends with
other political activists, such as folk singer Woody Guthrie. </p>

<p>Thompson had started writing for magazines in the 1920s, but in the
1940s he turned to crime fiction as a way of making money. Thompson's
first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Now and on Earth</span>
(1942), owed much to Erskine Caldwell and John Steinbeck. In the story
the father of the protagonist dies in an asylum, killing himself by
eating the stuffing from his mattress, the fate Thompson often claimed
of his own father. <span style="font-style: italic;">Heed the Thunder</span> came out in 1946. These early books were not successful.</p>
<p>Thompson worked as a journalist for the <i>New York Daily News</i> and for the<i> Los Angeles Times Mirror</i>.
In the 1950s he was blacklisted during the period of Joseph McCarthy's
"crusade" against Communists. Later he was summoned to Hollywood by the
director <a href="kubrick.htm">Stanley Kubrick</a> to co-write screenplays. <i>The Killing</i> (1956), based on Lionel White's <i>Clean Break</i>,
was a downbeat movie about robbery at a racetrack. Kubrick showed in it
his characteristic precision and care in the construction. Sterling
Hayden plays Johnny Clay who plans the robbery, but in the end most of
his gang is shot and he loses the money. <br>
</p>
      <p><i>Paths of Glory </i>(1957), an anti-war film based on Humphrey Cobb's 1935 novel and starring Kirk Douglas and Adolphe Menjou,
was set in the French trenches of World War I. Kubrick rewrote the
script with Thompson. Douglas considered it a catastrophe and he
demanded that they use the original script, which was done. However,
Thompson stayed in Hollywood and made scripts for the TV series <i>Dr. Kildare</i> and <i>Convoy</i> and produced one paperback novel based on <i>Ironside</i>. Two years before his death Thompson had a cameo-appearance as Judge Grayle in the 1975 film adaptation of Chandler's <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i>, starring Robert Mitchum. </p>

<p>Thompson's fifth book,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Killer Inside Me</span>
(1952), published by Lion Books in New York City, made his reputation.
Most of the book Thompson wrote at the U.S. Marine Corps base in
Quantico, Virginia, where he had found a temporary shelter at the home
of his sister and her husband. The central character and first-person
narrator is a small town sheriff Lou Ford, who pretends to be
dim-witted. In fact is a cunning, complex, even brilliant madman, who
plays cat and mouse with the world. Stanley Kubrick considered the book
the most chilling account of a criminally warped mind he had ever
encountered. In the film version from 1976, directed by Burt Kennedy,
the outwardly amiable deputy sheriff Lou Ford says: "When things get a
little rough, I just go out and kill a few people." Another sharply
portrayed psychopath is found in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Nothing Man </span>(1954),
in which the protagonist, a newspaperman Clinton Brown, drinks and
kills but cannot even get himself blamed for the crimes he commits.
Thompson's autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bad Boy</span>
(1953), was about his chaotic coming of age, bootlegging, and how he
almost got himself beaten to death by a homicidal sheriff's deputy. </p>
<p>In the 1950s Thompson wrote nearly 20 novels, without much attempt
at polishing them. He was frequently broke, regularly fired for his
boozing, and sometimes separated from his family. His problems with
liquor Thompson depicted in<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Alcoholics</span> (1953). Also<i> The Nothing Man</i>
portrayed the victims of drink. Because of moderate success he wrote
fast, and repeated himself in later works, recycling amongst others <i>The Killer Inside Me</i> again in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pop. 1280 </span>(1964).
The awarded mystery writer and critic H.R.F. Keating selected it for
his list of the one hundred best crime novels. "The great merit of the
novels of Jim Thompson is that they are completely without good taste,
and of them perhaps Pop. 1280 (the title refers to the population of a
small town in an imaginary Potts County in deepest America) has the
least good taste of all." <font size="2">(Keating in </font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987)</font>
In the story Nick Corey is seemingly a weak sheriff, but he eventually
shoots one of his tormentors. When he kicks him he comments "it wasn't
real nice to kick a dying man, and maybe it wasn't. But I'd been
wanting to kick him for a long time, and it just never had seemed safe
till now."</p>
<p>Several of Thompson's stories are set in the deep South, where he moved in a similar atmosphere of decay and the macabre as 
William Faulkner in his novels. Faulknerian twisted family relationships marked <span style="font-style: italic;">The Grifters </span>(1963),
a story about a doomed Oedipus character, Roy Dillon. He wants to have
a stable life, is cheated by his mother, Lilly, and dies rather
clumsily. Lilly hits him with her handbag as he takes a drink of water
&#8211; the glass breaks and cuts his throat. Stephen Frears' film version of
the book gained four Academy Award nominations, including best-adapted
screenplay for Donald Westlake. "The film immediately sets up a
parallel between the three swindlers &#8211; Lilly Dillon (Anjelica Huston),
Roy Dillon (John Cusack), and Moira Langtry (Annette Bening) &#8211; by
crosscutting between them and putting them on a split screen.
Thompson's focus is clearly on Roy as the only one of the three who
stands any chance of redemption. In the film, however, none of them are
redeemable. In the novel, for example, Roy's guilty seduction of Carol
introduces a moral dimension to the story, marking him as a man who
does distinguish between innocence and experience, a distinction not
made in the film." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Novels into Film </font></i><font size="2">by John C. Tibbetts and James M. Welsh, 1999) </font></p>
<p>Thompson himself was an admirer of the classic Russian novelist
Fyodor Dostoevsky. His favorite characters were barflies, grifters,
losers, and psychopaths. There is nothing certain in his world. Or as
the writer once said: "There are 32 ways to write a story, and I have
used every one, but there is only one plot &#8211; things are not what they
seem." An example of Thompson's skill in finding new approaches to
crime stories is seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Getaway</span>
(1959). It starts with a bank robbery that goes wrong, then returns
years later to the life of the criminal mastermind Doc and his wife who
are chased by both the police and criminals. Thompson finally leaves
the couple at a hideout, which is a kind of prison, only much worse. </p>
<p>In the 1970s Thompson had several apoplectic strokes. He was always
in need of money, and he drank it away as soon as he got any. In his
last book, <span style="font-style: italic;">King Blood</span>
(1973) he returned to the figure of his father, "a heavyset young man
with the profile of McKinley". Thompson died in Los Angeles on April 7,
1977. His death caused little attention and none of his work was in
print at that time in his own country. Thompson remained in the U.S. a
minor figure in the history of pulp fiction until some academic critics
and publishers resurrected his work. His dialogue was seen as crisp as
Hammett's, prose as convincing as Chandler's. Most of his novels and
some of his uncollected short fiction have been reprinted. </p>
