<p>French philosopher, whose two collections of essays, <i>Pour Marx</i> (1965) and 
<i>Lire de Capital</i> (1965), deeply influenced Marxist thought in the
West. When Marx's early writings inspired a number of New Left thinkers
&#8211; especially his analysis of alienation in capitalist society &#8211;
Althusser focused on the mature Marx. Althusser's career virtually
ended in 1980 after he murdered his wife. He was declared unfit to
stand trial and institutionalized until 1983. During the last, tragic
period of his life, Althusser wrote two versions of his autobiography, <i>Les Faits</i> (1992) and <i>L'Avenir diure Longtemps</i> (1992). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"To be more precise, I should say, that Marx 'opened up' for scientific knowledge a new 'continent', that of </b></font><b><i><font size="2">history</font></i><font size="2">
&#8211; just as Thales opened up the 'continent' of mathematics for
scientific knowledge, and Galileo opened up the 'continent' of physical
nature for scientific knowledge."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">For Marx</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Louis Althusser was born in Birmandries, near Algiers, Algeria, the
son of Charles Althusser and Lucienne Berger. His father was a bank
manager, whom Althusser saw as an authoritative, distant figure, whose
nightmares and shrieks and occasional violent outbursts terrified him.
Althusser was a Catholic. The monastic life fascinated him in his
youth, and he remained a believer until somewhere about 1947. </p>
<p>Althusser was educated at Algiers, Marseilles, and Lyons. In 1939 he
was admitted to the Ecole Normale Supérieure, but the war interrupted
his studies, and he was called up in September. Althusser did not see
action in the early days of World War II. In 1940 Germans occupied
northern and eastern France. Althusser spent five years in a German
concentration camp, mostly in Schleswig, Stalag XA. Later he said, that
he found life easy because he enjoyed the comradeship of men and behind
barbed wires he felt well protected. After the war Althusser started
his studies the Ecole Normale Supérieure, where, with his sense of
coming from a 'different world', he felt of being a complete stranger.</p>


<p>During this period Althusser met Hélène Rytman, who become his companion and later his 
wife. From the beginning, they were kindred spirits, both lonely and anguished. Althusser has said, 
that  after making love with Hélène for the first time, he fell in depression. He was 
admitted to Saint-Anne's Hospital, where he was given shock treatment. This pattern remained basically 
unchanged &#8211; depression, therapy and shock treatment, and periods of active writing and working. 
Hélène stayed with him through the following decades, even though he was openly  
unfaithful. "But what moved me more than anything were her hands, which never changed. 
They had been fashioned by work and bore the marks of hard labour, yet her touch had a wonderful 
tenderness which betrayed her heartbreak and helplessness. They were the hands of a poor, 
wretched old woman who had nothing and no one to turn to, yet who found it in her heart to 
go on giving. I was filled with such sorrow at the suffering engraved on them. I have often 
wept into these hands and they have often made me weep, though I never told her why. I 
feared it would cause her pain. &#8211; Hélène, my Hélène..."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Future Lasts Forever</font></i><font size="2">) </font>Hélène Légotien, or Rytman, was Jewish. She had joined the French Communist Party in the 1930s and fought in the Resistance.  </p>
<p>Althusser completed a master's thesis in 1948 on the German
philosopher G.W. Hegel &#8211; he had learned German while he was a prisoner.
He passed the difficult <i>agrégation</i> in philosophy and was
appointed to teach. In 1948 he joined the Communist Party, remaining
its life-long member. His relations with the secretary general, Georges
Marchais, and other members of the leadership, were never easy. Due to
his leanings toward Maoism, he was nearly dispelled in 1966 in a
dispute over China's Cultural Revolution. Althusser mentions in his
book of memoir, <i>L'Avenir diure Longtemps</i>, that Mao had granted
him an interview, but he dropped it, fearing the political reaction
against him. In 1978 he launched an attack on the Communist Party in <i>Le Monde</i>.  Just before his tragic collapse, Althusser sought in 1979 an audience with the Pope, John Paul II. </p>
<p>Althusser was a relatively unknown political philosopher until 1965. In fact, he had the 
reputation of being a recluse. Althusser had published a study on Montesquieu and a selection 
from Feuerbach. <i>Pour Marx</i> and <i>Lire de Capital</i>, a collection of 
papers written for a seminar on <i>Das Kapital</i> at the École Normale Supérieure in 1965, changed the situation. These books 
represented intellectually hard-line Marxism, but not dogmatism. By reading Marx "to the letter" 
Althusser challenged contemporary 
softer interpretations of Marx's work. During Marx's lifetime, only the first volume  
was published  of his magnum opus, which runs to approximately 3000 printed pages. 
Marx supervised the preparation of a French edition of 
volume 1, translated by Joseph Roy and published by Maurice La 
Châtre in 1872. Although Althusser refers to the German edition, 
Roy's translation was the principal text that 
was used in <i>Reading Capital</i>.  </p>

<p>After the rise of the student movement in 1968, Althusser's
influence in France faded. Moreover, there never was an "Althusserian
school" in France, but his work had a massive influence on British and
American literary and cultural critics in the 1970s. The Marxist critic
Terry Eagleton said, "The appeal of Althusser's work, generally
speaking, was that while it seemed on the one hand in its concerns with
ideology and and the 'relative autonomy' of superstructures to offer a
key theoretical concepts to those engaged in the socialist analysis of
culture, it presented itself simultaneously, in its rehabilition of the
'scientific' Marx, Leninism and its&nbsp; vigorous anti-humanis, as in
some sense politically revolutionary." <br>
</p>
      <p>During the turbulent events in May 1968, Althusser was in a
sanatorium, recuperating from depression &#8211; Althusser himself once
counted that he suffered at least fifteen depressions from 1947 to
1980. For the disappointment of the students, he supported the official
party line and did not consider the situation basically revolutionary.
Later his view changed, and he held that there was real atmosphere of
fraternity on the streets and Party had lost touch with the student
masses in revolt. </p>

<p>On November 6, 1980 Althusser killed his wife. In  <i>L'Avenir diure Longtemps</i>
Althusser tells that he used to massage Hélène's neck, but this time he
massaged the front of her neck. "Yet I knew she had been strangled. But
how? I stood up and screamed: 'I've strangled Hélène!'" In medical
examination, the skin on her neck bore no external marks of
strangulation. Althusser avoided prison &#8211; for the fustration of the
media and Althusser himself, he was denied the whole procedure of a
public court appearance. Althusser stayed in hospital until 1983. He in
the north of Paris, isolated from all but a few friends. Althusser died
of a heart attack on October 22, 1990. </p>
<p>Althusser sought to reread Marx, rescue him from Soviet dogmatism,
and humanistic interpretations, and reestablish their pace in class
struggle. In much similar way, Althusser viewed Machiavelli, writing
that he represented a beginning, and asking: "For how are we to
understand that this beginning has lasted down to the present, and
still endures for us?" His first major articles on Marx, published in <i>La Pen</i> and <i>La Nouvelle Critique</i>, were collected in <i>Pour Marx</i>,
which is regarded as the founding text of the school of 'structuralist'
Marxism. Marxism was not for Althusser an ideology or world-view but a
revolutionary science, ultimately the science of society. "I should add
that, just as the foundation of mathematics by Thales 'induced' the
birth of the Platonic philosophy, just as the foundation of physics by
Galileo 'induced' the birth of Cartesian philosophy, etc., so the
foundation of the science of history by Marx has 'induced' the birth of
a new, theoretically and practically revolutionary philosophy, Marxist
philosophy or dialectical materialism." </p>
<p>According to Althusser, the "epistemological rupture" (<i>coupure épistémologique</i>)
around 1845-45, marked Marx's coming of age as a 'scientific' theorist
&#8211; he abandoned his earlier humanism derived from Feuerbach and Hegel.
"Antihumanism" in this connection means that Marx downgraded the role
of human agency in history and developed a theory of history as a
"process without a subject." From structuralists, and partly from
Freud, Althusser borrowed his method of "symptomatic reading", an
analysis of deep structures beneath the surface of the text. Also he
adopted some of the psychoanalytic concepts of the French psychoanalyst
Jacques Lacan, his friend, whose ideas he examined in the essay 'Freud
and Lacan' (1994). In his analysis of the development of science
Althusser came close to Thomas Kuhn's <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> (1962). When Althusser speaks of <i>problématique</i>,
"the particular unity of a theoretical formation" or the underlying
structure of thought, Kuhn used the word "paradign," a term that
relates closely to 'normal science' (before the inevitable SNAFU). <br>
</p>
<p>Marx's debt to Hegel is a well-known fact, but Althusser tried to
show that Marx's thought was fundamentally anti-Hegelian &#8211; the basic
structures of the Hegelian and Marxist dialectic were essentially
different. In Hegel's idealist philosophy the world is the realization
of Absolute Spirit. In Marxist analysis, the economic base and
superstructure (political and ideological practice) form a complex
social whole, but the economic structure is determinant in the last
instance. Althusser himself emphasized the relative autonomy of the
politico-ideological superstructure. Thus he could explain, that the
'cult of personality', by which he refers to Stalin, belonged to the
domain of the superstructure and the socialist infrastructure was able
to develop in the Soviet Union without essential damage during the
reign of Stalin. </p>
<p>Althusser wrote mostly on political theory, but in 'A Letter on Art
in Reply to André Daspere' (1966) he investigated the effect of
ideology on artworks. He thesis was that "ideology represents imaginary
relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence." All
ideological State appratuses &#8211; family, education, religion, sport,
press, radio, etc. &#8211; reflect bourgeois ideology. Althusser himself
denied being a structuralist, and called Structuralism "structuralist
ideology". Althusser did not rank real art among the ideologies. Art
does not give us knowledge like science does, but it makes us to <i>see</i>
the ideology from which it is born. Althusser's theory of ideology has
influenced the literary critics Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. </p>
<p>With his confession, <i>The Future Lasts Forever</i>, Althusser
wanted the break the wall of silence around him. Its material must have
pleased his psychoanalysts - he claims that he had an Oidipal
attachment to his mother, he did not lern to masturbate until at the
age of twenty-seven, he practiced shoplifting one month in Brittany,
and he was obsessed with thought that his writings would expose him as
a trickster and deceiver, a "philosopher who knew almost nothing about
the history of philosophy or about Marx..." Althusser admits that his
memoirs includes also hallucinations between true accounts. One
imaginary detail in <i>The Facts</i> deals with President De Gaulle.
Althusser meets him on a street. De Gaulle has a cigarrette dangling
from his mouth and he asks Althusser for a light. They have a brief
discussion. A week later De Gaulle invites Althusser to dinner and the
discussions continue. </p>
