<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American writer, journalist, and humorist,
who
won a worldwide audience for his stories of youthful adventures of Tom
Sawyer
and Huckleberry Finn. Sensitive to the sound of language, Twain
introduced colloquial speech into American fiction. In <i>Green Hills
of Africa</i>, Ernest Hemingway wrote: <b><font size="2">"</font></b>All
modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i>..."</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When I was a boy, there was but
one permanent ambition among my comrades in our village on the west
bank of the Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman."</b>
(from 'Old Times on the Mississippi', 1875) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens (Mark Twain) was born in Florida,
Missouri, of a Virginian family. The family soon moved to Hannibal,
Missouri, where Twain was brought up. At school, accroding to his own
words, he "excelled only in spelling". After his father's death in
1847, Twain was apprenticed to a printer. Her also started his career
as a journalist by writing for the Hannibal <i>Journal</i>. Later
Twain worked as a licensed Mississippi river-boat pilot (1857-61). His
famous penname Twain adopted from the call ('Mark twain!' &#8211; meaning by
the mark of two fathoms) used when sounding river shallows. But this
isn't the full story: he had also satirized an older writer, Isaiah
Sellers, who called himself Mark Twain. In 1861 Twain served briefly as
a confederate irregular. The Civil War put an end to the steamboat
traffic, and during a period when Twain was out of work, he lived in a
primitive cabin on Jackass Hill and tried his luck as a gold-miner. "I
would have been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like the
rest," he confessed. </p>
      <p>Twain moved to Virginia City, where he edited two years <i>
Territorial Enterprise</i>. On February 3, 1863, 'Mark Twain' was born
when he signed a humorous travel account with that pseudonym. In 1864
Twain left for California, where worked in San Francisco as a reporter.
After hearing a story about a frog, Twain made an entry in his
notebook: "Coleman with his jumping frog &#8211; bet a stranger $50. &#8211;
Stranger had no frog and C. got him one: &#8211; In the meantime stranger
filled C's frog full of shot and he couldn't jump. The stranger's frog
won." From these lines he developed 'Jim Smiley
and his Jumping Frog' which was published in <i>The Saturday Press</i>
of New York on the 18th of November in 1865. It was reprinted all over
the country and became the foundation stone of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</span> (1867). This work marked
the beginning of Twain's literary career. </p>
      <p>In 1866 Twain visited Hawaii as a correspondent for <i>The
Sacramento Union</i>, publishing letters on his trip. He then set out
world tour, travelling in France and Italy. His experiences Twain
recorded in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Innocents Abroad</span> (1869). The work, which gained him
wide popularity, poked fun at both American and European prejudices and
manners. Throughout his life, Twain frequently returned to travel
writing &#8211; many of his finest novels, including <span style="font-style: italic;">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span> (1876), dealt with journeys and escapes into freedom. </p>
      <p>The success of <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> gave Twain enough
financial security to marry Olivia Langdon in 1870, after writing about
189 love letters during his courtship. William Dean Howells praised the
author in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, and Twain thanked him by
saying: "When I read that review of yours, I felt like the woman who
was so glad her baby had come white." </p>
      <p>Olivia, Twain's beloved Livy, served and protected her husband
devotedly. They moved to Hartford, where the family remained, with
occasional trips abroad, until 1891. Twain continued to lecture in the
United States and England. Between 1876 and 1884 he published several
masterpieces. <i>Tom Sawyer</i> was originally intended for adults.
Twain had abandoned the work in 1874, but returned to it in the
following summer and even then was undecided if he were writing a book
for adults or for young readers. Eventually he declared that it was
"professedly and confessedly a boy's and girl's book".<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Prince and the Pauper</span> (1881) was about Edward VI of England and a little pauper
who change places. The book was dedicated "to those good-mannered and
agreeable children, Susie and Clara Clemens."<span style="font-style: italic;"> Life on the Mississippi</span>
(1883) contained an attack on the influence of Sir Walter Scott, whose
romanticism have caused according to Twain 'measureless harm' to
progressive ideas. From the very beginning of his journalistic career,
Twain made fun with the novel and its tradition. Although Twain enjoyed
magnificent popularity as a novelist, he believed that he lacked the
analytical sensibility necessary to the novelist's art. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span> (1884), an American Odysseus and a powerful
indictment of slavery, was first considered adult fiction. Huck, who
could not possibly<i> write </i>a story, <i>tells </i>us the story:
"You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of <i>The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, but that ain't no matter. That book was
made by Mr. Mark Twain and he told the truth, mainly." Both <i>Tom
Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> stand high on the list of
eminent writers like Stevenson, Dickens, and Saroyan who honestly
depicted young people. Huck's debate whether or not he will turn in
Jim, an escaped slave and a friend, probed the racial tensions of the
national conscience. Later Twain wrote in <i>The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg </i>(1900): "I have no race prejudices... All that I
care to know is that a man is a human being&#8212;that is enough for me; he
can't be any worse." A new and politically correct edition of the
novel, that replaced the notorious N-word with "slave", appeared in
2011 with a wave of negative comments. The 200-year old racial slur
appears in the book over 200 times. </p>
      <p>One of Twain's major achievements is the way he narrates <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i>, following the twists and turns of ordinary speech, his native
Missouri dialect. Shelley Fisher Fishkin has noted in <i>Was Huck
Black?</i> (1993) that the book drew upon a vernacular formed by black
voices as well as white. The model for Huck Finn's voice, according to
Fishkin, was a black child instead of a white one. The character of
Huck was based on a boy named Tom Blankenship, Twain's boyhood friend. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"Who is your folks?" he questions
me. </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">"The Phelpses, down yonder." </font><br>
        <font size="2">"Oh," he says, "how'd you say he got shot?" </font><br>
        <font size="2">"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him." </font><br>
        <font size="2">"Funny dream," the doctor says.' </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Huckleberry Finn</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson</span>  (1884) was a murder mystery and a case of transposed
identities, but also an implicit condemnation of a society that allows
slavery,. <span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc</span> (1895) was published
under the pseudonym of Sieur Louis de Conte. In the 1890s Twain lost
most of his earnings in financial speculations and in the downhill of
his own publishing firm, C.L. Webster, which he had established in 1884
in New York City. In 1894 he had invested in the infamous Paige
typesetter, which never worked. "Paige and I always met on elusively
affectionate terms," Twain said, "&amp; yet he knows perfectly well
that if I had him in a steel trap I would shut out all human succor
&amp; watch that trap until he died..." Twain closed Hartford house. To
recover from the bankrupt, he started a world lecture tour. By 1898 he
had repaid all debts. From 1896 to 1900 he resided mainly in Europe.
During the tour Susy, his favorite daughter, died of spinal meningitis.
      </p>
      <p>Twain traveled New Zealand, Australia, India, and South
Africa, and returned to the U.S. in 1900. Twain's travel book,<span style="font-style: italic;">
Following the Equator</span>, came out in 1897. In 1902 Twain made a trip to
Hannibal, his home town which had inspired several of his works. His
plans for a peaceful and quiet visit were ruined when more than 100
newspapers chronicled his every move. Between 1870 and 1905 Twain tried
repeatedly to write or dictate his autobiography. His dictations to a
stenographer formed the bulk of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Autobiography of Mark Twain</span>, but he
insisted that it should not be published in its entirety until a
hundred years after his death. "A book that is not to be published for
a century gives the writer a freedom which he could secure in no other
way," Twain said. However, parts of the text appeared in 1924, then in
1940 and 1959. </p>
      <p>The death of his wife in 1904 in Florence and his second
daughter darkened the author's life, which is also seen in writings and
his posthumously published autobiography (1924). Twain's view of the
human nature had never been very optimistic, but during final years, he
become even more bitter: "I believe that our Heavenly Father invented
man because he was disappointed in the monkey."<font size="2"><b> </b></font>Especially
hostile Twain was towards Christianity: "If men neglected 'God's poor'
and 'God's stricken and helpless ones' as He does, what would become of
them? The answer is to be found in those dark lands where man follows
His example and turns his indifference back upon them: they get no help
at all; they cry, and plead and pray in vain, they linger and suffer,
and miserably die." <font size="2">(from 'Thoughts of God')</font>
Twain died on April 21, 1910. His autobiography Twain dictated to his
secretary A.B. Paine; various versions of it have been published.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Mysterious Stranger</span> from 1916 was set in the 16th-century Austria,
in which Satan reveals the hypocrisies and stupidities of the village
of Eseldorf. "The first man was a hypocrite and a coward, qualities
which have not yet failed in his line; it is the foundation upon which
all civilizations have been built." The work was composed between 1897
and 1908 in several, quite different versions, one of which was set in
Hannibal, another in a print shop. Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain's
authorized biographer, apparently added to it a concluding chapter from
another version altogether. Mark Twain's colorful life inspired the film<i>
The Adventures of Mark Twain </i>(1944), directed by Irving Rapper and
starring Fredric March. In Philip José Farmer's Riverworld epic Mark
Twain was one of the central characters. </p>

      <p>During his long writing career, Twain produced a considerable
number of essays, which appeared in various newspapers and in
magazines, including the <i>Galaxy</i>, <i>Harper's</i>, the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, and <i>North American Review</i>. In his 'Sandwich
Islands' letters (1873) Twain described how the missionaries and
American government have corrupted the Hawaiians, 'Queen Victoria's
Jubilee' (1897) presented the pomp and pageantry of an English royal
procession, and 'King Leopold's Soliloquy' (1905) revealed in a
dramatic monologue the political evils caused by despotism. The King
complains: "Blister the meddlesome missionaries! They write tons of
these things. They seem to be always around, always spying, always
eye-witnessing the happenings; and everything they see they commit to
paper... One of these missionaries saw eighty-one of these hands drying
over a fire for transmission to my officials&#8212;and of course they must go
and set it down and print it... nothing is too trivial for them to
print..." Twain's finest satire of imperialism was perhaps 'To the
Person Sitting in Darkness' (1901), in which the author wrote that the
people in darkness are beginning to see "more light than... was
profitable for us." </p>
