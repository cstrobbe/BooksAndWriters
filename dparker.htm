<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American short story writer, poet, and critic,
a legendary figure in the New York literary scene. Dorothy Parker wrote sketches and short stories, many of them published in <I>The New Yorker. </I>Her column, 'Constant Reader,' was highly popular.

<P>Dorothy Parker was born in West End, New Jersey, the fourth and last child of Jacob (Henry) Rothschild, a garment manufacturer, and Annie Eliza (Marston) Rothschild, the daughter of a machinist at Phoenix Armour. Her paternal grandparents came from Russia. Parker's mother died in 1898. Jacob married in 1900 Eleanor Frances Lewis, a Roman Catholic; Parker never liked her stepmother. Eleanor Frances died of a heart attack three years after the wedding. Parker's father died when she was twenty. </P>
<P>Parker was educated at a Catholic school. "But as for helping me in the outside world, the convent taught me only that if you spit on a pencil eraser it will erase in," Parker said later in an interview. She moved to New York City, whe she wrote during the day and earned money at night playing the piano in a dancing school. </P>
<P>In 1916 Parker sold some of her poetry to the editor of <I>Vogue</I>, and was given an editorial position on the magazine. In 1917 she married Edwin Pond Parker II, a stockbroker, whom she divorced in 1919. Edwin was wounded in World War I, he was an alcoholic, and during the war he became addicted to morphine. </P>
<P>From 1917 to 1920 Parker worked for <I>Vanity Fair. </I>Frank Crowinshield, the managing editor of the magazine, recalled that she had "the quickest tongue imaginable, and I need not to say the keenest sense of mockery." With two other writers Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood, Parker formed the nucleus of the Algonquin Round Table, an informal luncheon club held at New York City's Algonquin Hotel on Forty-Fourth Street. Other members included Ring Lardner and James Thurber. Parker was usually the only woman in the group. </P><P>Between the years 1927 and 1933 Parker wrote book reviews for <I>The New Yorker</I>. Her texts continued appear in the magazine at irregular intervals until 1955. Her first collection of poems, <I>Enough Rope</I>, was published in 1926. It contained the often-quoted 'R&eacute;sum&eacute;' on suicide, and 'News Item.' <I>Enough Rope </I>was a bestseller and was followed by <I>Sunset Guns</I> (1928) and <I>Death and Taxes </I>(1931), which were collected in <I>Collected Poems: Not So Deep As a Well </I>(1936). Parker's poems were sardonic, usually dry, elegant commentaries on love, or shallowness of modern life: "Why is it no one sent me yet / One perfect limousine, do you suppose? / Ah no, it's always just my luck to get / One perfect rose."<FONT size=2> (1926) </FONT><FONT size=3>The poem 'Day-Dreams' mocked domestic married life, which she associated in the short story 'Such a Pretty Little Picture' with death and entrapment. However, later in life she took up knitting, tried to conceive a child, and wrote in a letter: "I love having a house, I love its being pretty whenever you look, I love a big yard full of dogs." She also bought a farm in Buck Country, Pennsylvania. </FONT></P><P><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>The</FONT> </FONT>short story collections <I>After Such Pleasures</I> (1932) and <I>Here Lies</I> (1939, proved sharp understanding of human nature. Like Hemingway, whose work she admired, Parker relied rather on dialogue than on description. Among her best-known pieces are 'A Big Blonde,' which won her O. Henry Memorial Award, and the soliloquies 'A Telephone Call' and 'The Waltz.' </P>
<P>During the 1920s Parker had extra-marital affairs, she drank heavily and attempted suicide three times, but maintained the high 
quality of her literary output. Her brief affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald while he was married to the unstable Zelda was motivated, 
according to the gossip columnist Sheilah Graham, by compassion on her part and despair on his. In <I>Enough Rope</I> Parker wrote: "Four be the things I am wiser to know: / Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe."<B></B><B><FONT size=2> </FONT></B></P>
<P>In the 1930s, Parker moved with her second husband, Alan Campbell, who was twelve years her junior, to Hollywood. She worked there as a screenwriter, including on the film <I>A Star Is Born </I>(1937), directed by William Wellman and starring Janet Gaynor, Fredric March, and Adolphe Menjou. The film received an Oscar for Best Original Story. In Alfred Hitchcock's film<I> Saboteur </I>(1940) Parker collaborated with Peter Vierter and Joan Harrison. Her contribution is mainly visible in some of the bizarre details of the circus milieu where the hero (Robert Cummings) takes refuge in, with its squabbling Siamese twins, its bearded lady in curlers and a malevolent dwarf who acts and dresses a bit like Hitler. Parker and Hitchcock appeared in the film together in a cameo bit. Otherwise the film bored her. </P>
<P>Temptations of Hollywood did not make Parker any softer, which a number of film stars had to face. When Joan Crawford was married to Franchot Tone, she became obsessed with self-improvement. Parker said: "You can lead a whore to culture, but you can't make her think." </P><P>Parker had taken an early stand against Fascism and Nazism and she declared herself a Communist, for which she was blacklisted during the McCarthy era. However, she was never a member of the Communist Party. <A href="lhellman.htm">Lillian 
Hellman</A>&nbsp;wrote in her memoir of Parker that she "believed in socialism but seldom, except in the sticky sentimental minutes, could stand the sight of a working radical."&nbsp;Edmund Wilson remarked in his review of <EM>The Portable Dorothy Parker</EM> (1944) that her political work durin her Hollywood years was a waste of time. </P><P>With Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, Parker helped found the Screen Writers' Guild. She also&nbsp;was active in raising&nbsp;money&nbsp;for Loyalist Spain,&nbsp;China, and the Scottsboro defendants, and helped Hemingway and Hellman finance the film <EM>The Spanish Earth</EM>. FBI kept a file on Parker. Due to her activities, she was denied during World War II a passport, when she wanted to work as a correspondent abroad. </P><P>Parker's last major film project was <I>The Fan</I> (1949), directed by Otto Preminger. The director had spent with Parker a period in 1939 working on a play script called <EM>The Happiest Man</EM>. Parker turned with her partner, Ross Evans, a revision of Walter Reisch's script, which Preminger&nbsp;shot in 32 days instead of the scheduled 42.&nbsp;<EM>The Fan</EM> was based on Oscar Wilde's play <I>Lady Windermere's Fan</I>, but Wilde's witty comments on society and Parker's less funny updating did not amuse the audience. Later Preminger admitted that "it was one of the few pictures I disliked while I was working on it."&nbsp;Bosley Crowther,&nbsp; the film critic for <EM>The New York Time</EM>,&nbsp;pronounced&nbsp;it "strangely uninspired." </P><P>Parker's play <EM>Ladies of the Corridor</EM> (1953), written with Arnaud d'Usseau, was&nbsp;about rich and lonely women in a New York hotel. When it was first staged on Broadway at New York's Longcare Theatre, starring Betty Field, June Walker, Walter Matthau, Edna Best, and Sheppard Strudwick, it did not do well.&nbsp;Arnaud d'Usseau considered the television production from 1975, directed by Robert Stevens, superior to the original. </P>
<P>Alan Campbell died in 1963, according to the coroner's report "of acute barbiturate poisoning due to an ingestion of overdose." Parker died alone on June 7, 1967, in the New York hotel that had chosen as her final home. A chambermaid discovered the body. Parker left her estate to civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1972 the executorship of Parker's estate passed to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Lillian Helman criticed the her decision by saying that, "It's one thing to have real feeling for Black people, but to have the kind of blind sentimentality about the N.A.A.C.P., a group so conservative that even many Blacks don't have respect for, is something else." Parker's ashes were transferred in 1998 to a memorial garden of NAACP's Baltimore headquarters. Alan Rudolph's film <I>Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle</I> (1994), starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dorothy Parker, depicted the life of the author and her friends around the famous Algonquin Round Table. In addition, Parker&nbsp;has been&nbsp;portrayed by Dolores Sutton in the TV movie <EM>F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood</EM> (1976) and Rosemary Harris in <EM>Julia</EM> (1977).
