<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Popular British author, who described
realistically Victorian world. Trollope's best known stories were set
in the imaginary English county of Barsetshire. In his autobiography
(1883) Trollope wrote, that the novelist's task is "to make his readers
so intimately acquainted with his characters that the creation of his
brain should be to them speaking, moving, living, human creatures."
Trollope is notable for having developed the chronicle form of fiction.
The Barsetshire novels were the first serial fiction in English
literature. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is a comfortable feeling to know that you stand on your own ground. Land is about the only thing that can't fly away."</b> (from <i>The Last Chronicle of Barset</i>, 1867) </font></blockquote>
<p>Anthony Trollope was born at 16 Keppel Street in London. He was the
fifth of seven children. His father, Thomas Anthony, was a fellow of
New College, Oxford, who failed both as a lawyer and as a farmer. The
family's poverty made Trollope miserable at the rigid public social
hierarchy in Harrow and Winchester. "It is hard to think of any good
writer who had as wretched a time and had to endure it for so long," C.
P. Snow wrote in <i>Trollope </i>(1975). Sometimes his parents could
not afford to pay their son's school fees. After financial troubles,
the family moved to Belgium, where Trollope's father died,
broken-hearted and ill. </p>
<p>Trollope's mother, Frances Trollope (1780-1863), took her three
youngest children to America to assist in the founding of the city of
New Harmony, Memphis. The venture failed, and she traveled for fifteen
months in America. In 1832, back in England, she published <i>Domestic Manners of the Americans</i><font face="Symbol">-</font>s<font face="Symbol"></font>he
was at that time 52. The work gained success, and she could support her
family through her writing. Trollope has recalled that some of her best
works were born during the tragic period when her husband and daughter
died. She continued writing until she was seventy-six. </p>
<p>Trollope joined at the age of 19 the post office, where he worked as
a clerk. In 1841, at the age of 26, he became a postal surveyor in
Ireland. Trollope spent in this work for 33 years and used later his
experiences in many novels. After marrying Rose Heseltine in 1844,
Trollope set up a house at Clonmel and started his literary career.
Soon after marrying Trollope began writing his spare time to earn extra
money. He also began to speculate about the health of his wife and
wrote to Miss Dorothea Sankey, another Irish woman of his acquaintance:
"Should anything happen to her, will you supply her place<font face="Symbol">-</font>as soon as a proper period of decent mourning is over?" Eventually Rose Heseltine outlived her husband. </p>
<p>On Post Office business Trollope traveled in Egypt (1858), the West
Indies (1858-59), and the United States (1861-62, 1868). "The marine
people - the captain and his satellites<font face="Symbol">-</font>are
bound to provide me; and all that they have provided is yams, salt
pork, biscuit, and bad coffee," complained Trollope on his ocean voyage
to Cuba in 1859. "I should be starved but for the small ham<font face="Symbol">-</font>would that it had been a large one<font face="Symbol">-</font>which I thoughtfully purchased in Kingston..." (from <i>The West Indies and the Spanish Main</i>,
1859). By the end of his professional career Trollope had became a
successful civil servant. Among his achievements is the introduction of
the red British mail boxes for letters, known as pillar-boxes. Before
the mailboxes one had to go to the Post Office to mail a letter. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Needless to deny that the normal London
plumber is a dishonest man. We do not even allow ourselves to think so.
That question, as to the dishonesty of mankind generally, is one that
disturbs us greatly; - whether a man in all grades of life will by
degrees train his honesty to suit his own book, so that the course of
life which he shall bring himself to regard as soundly honest shall, if
known to his neighbours, subject him to their reproof. We own to a
doubt whether the honesty of a bishop would shine bright as the morning
star to the submissive ladies who now worship him, if the theory of
life upon which he lives were understood by them in all its bearings." </b>(The 'Plumber', 1880)</font></blockquote>
<p>In 1859 he moved back to London and resigned from the civil service
in 1867. His election campaign as a Liberal parliamentary candidate was
unsuccessful, but about 1869 Trollope began his creative late period,
publishing psychological and sharply satirical novels. Between the
years 1867 and 1870 he edited the <i>St Paul's Magazine</i>. In 1871-72 he traveled in Australia and New Zealand, again in Australia in 1875, and in South Africa in 1877. </p>
<p>Trollope regularly produced 1000 words an hour before breakfast<font face="Symbol">-</font>
his page contained 250 words. "Perhaps the main characteristic of
writers like Jane Austen and Trollope is their complete
non-literariness", noted Ford Madox Ford in <i>The March of Literature</i>
(1938). "Indeed, you would say that they are without the passion to
write that distinguishes a Balzac, a Dickens, a Thackeray or even a
genuine artist like Gautier." Trollope spent three productive hours a
day at his desk, before a quire of paper, pen in hand. "I always began
my task by reading the work of the day before," he wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">An Autobiography</span>
(1883). "I would strongly recommend this practice to all tyros in
writing". Rewriting Trollope considered "a waste of time." In the
evening he enjoyed playing whist at the Garrick Club. </p>
<p> Trollope's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Macdermots of Ballycloran</span>,
was published in 1847. The powerful story depicted a doomed Irish
family. The book did not sell and the published attributed the
authorship to Trollope's mother, a better known writer. It took 12
years before Trollope started to make money with his pen. Most of his
novels appeared first in serialized form in magazines. </p>
<p>His reputation as a writer Trollope established with his fourth novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Warden&nbsp;</span>
(1855), which was set in the imaginary English county Barsetshire. The
story told about a clergyman whose gentle life is upset when he is
accused of misusing money meant for the old people's home he looks
after. <i>The Warden </i>was conceived according to the author while
wandering round Salisbury cathedral on a summer evening. It was
followed by the 'Chronicles of Barsetshire', <span style="font-style: italic;">Barchester Towers</span> (1857), perhaps the most popular of all his novels, <span style="font-style: italic;">Doctor Thorne</span> (1858), <span style="font-style: italic;">Framley Parsonage</span> (1861), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Small House at Allington</span> (1864), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Last Chronicle of Barset </span>(1967),
which the author considered his finest novel. The series with realistic
presentation of middle-class domestic relationship was received with
enthusiasm by the mid-Victorian reading public. With humour and gentle
satire, the author told stories of ordinary men and women with human
weaknesses. </p>
<p>Palliser series was about an invented family of nobles started in 1864 with the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Can You Forgive Her?</span>  It continued with <span style="font-style: italic;">Phineas Finn</span> (1869), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Eustace Diamonds</span> (1873), <span style="font-style: italic;">Phineas Redux</span> (1876), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Prime Minister</span> (1876), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Duke's Children</span> (1880). One of the central characters, Plantagenet Palliser (later Lord Omnium), had first appeared in <i>The Small House at Allington</i>.
Trollope deepened the presentation of the dry, ambitious politician and
his brilliant wife Glencora, and later considered that they were the
two characters on whom his reputation with posterity would rest. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Way We Live Now</span> (1874-75) was a social satire, which has been compared to Thackeray's <i>Vanity Fair </i>(1848).
Trollope wrote it after returning to England from the colonies. The
central character is Augustus Melmotte, an Austrian Jewish financier,
who moves to London and and becomes the center of financial and
political intrigues. </p>
<p>The Barset novels and Palliser series took together over twenty
years of Trollope's writing life. His popularity was at its peak during
the 1860s, when he lived at Waltham House, Hertfordshire. Especially
readers admired his detailed description of social life and vivid
psychological portraits of his characters, among them Madame Max
Goesler, who appeared in several novels, and the scheming Mrs. Proudie.
George Eliot remarked that his books "are filled with belief in
goodness without the slightest tinge of maudlin." Nathaniel Hawthorne
wrote that Trollope's novels are "solid, substantial, written on the
strength of beef and through the inspiration of ale..." Trollope
himself boasted that he produced novels with factory-like
methodicalness. Henry James regarded it as a "betrayal of a sacred
office and a "terrible crime", when Trollope admitted to his readers
that the events he narrates have not really happened, and that he can
give his narrative any turn the reader like best. </p>
<p>Trollope's work continued in more realistic vein the
literary tradition on <a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/wmthacke.htm">William Thackeray</a>, of
whom he wrote a study in 1879. He published some 40 novels, short stories, travel books, and
essays. His only science fiction novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fixed Period</span>
(1882), was set in 1980 and dealt with euthanasia; a plan is launched
on the imaginary island of Britannula near New Zealand to put away
people who have reached the age of 67.The story was narrated by the President of the Republic.  <br>
</p>
      <p>Trollope lived in London from 1872 and
at Harting Grange, Sussex, until 1882. He had a private library of
5,000 volumes, which was dearer to him "even than the horses." Trollope
died in London on December 6, 1882. His last novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Scarborough's Family</span>,
was published posthumously in 1883. During the Second World War
Trollope's novels were read primarily as romances but from the 1970s,
critical revaluation of the author's contribution to the history of the
novel has taken place, and Trollope's reputation as a moralist has
risen greatly. However, still in the 1990s, his works were dismissed in
the London <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> as overrated and flat. </p>
