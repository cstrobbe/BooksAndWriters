<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Belgian playwright and poet who
was awarded in 1911 the Nobel Prize for Literature. Maurice Maeterlinck was closely 
associated with the French literary movement called symbolism, which used 
symbols to represent ideas and emotions. Among Maeterlinck's most famous 
plays is <i>The Blue Bird </i>(1908), a fairy tale with the theme of the 
search of happiness. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Indeed, it is not in the actions but in
the words that are found the beauty and greatness of tragedies that are
truly beautiful and great; and this not solely in the words that
accompany and explain the action, for there must perforce be another
dialogue besides the one which is superficially necessary. And indeed
the only words that count in the play are those that at first seemed
useless, for it is therein that the essence lies. Side by side with the
necessary dialogue will you almost always find another dialogue that
seems superfluous; but examine it carefully, and it will be borne home
to you that this is the only one that the soul can listen to
profoundly, for here alone is it the soul that is being addressed."</b> (from 'The Tragical in Daily Life' by Maurice Maeterlinck in </font><i><font size="2">The Treasure of the Humble</font></i><font size="2">, 1916) </font></blockquote>

<p>Count Maurice-Polydore-Marie-Bernard Maeterlinck was born in Ghent,
Belgium, into a prosperous family of francophone and Catholic
tradition. His father, Polydore Maeterlinck, was a retired notary and a
small land owner, and mother, Mathilde (Van den Bossche) Maeterlinck,
was the daughter of an affluent lawyer. The surname is said to have
been originated from a bailiff, who gave corn to the poor in a year of
famine. </p>
<p>As a child Maeterlinck lived in Oostacker. He attended the Jesuit
Collège de Ste.-Barge, a period of seven years' tyranny, as he later
recalled. However, there he met two future poets, Charles van Lerberghe
and Grégoire Le Roy. With them he contributed to <i>La Jeune Belgique</i>, a nationalistic literary review. His first poem, 'The Rushes', Maeterlick published at the age of 21.  
Because his family objected to his trifling with poetry, he was sent to study law at the University 
of Ghent. </p>

<p>After graduating in 1885, Maeterlinck spent some time in Paris. Maeterlinck  became acquainted with the symbolist poets <a href="mallarme.htm">Stéphane 
Mallarmé</a> and Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, who was much interested in 
occultism. Maeterlinck himself published a translation of Jan van Ruysbroeck <i>L'Ornement 
des noces spirituelles</i> (Ruysbroeck and the Mystics). After returning to Oostacker, Maeterlinck practiced law, but did not give up his 
writing. </p>
<p>In 1889 Maeterlinck published a volume of verse, <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Serres chaudes</span> (Hot House Blooms), full of fin-de-siècle mysterious 
images. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">La Princesse Maleine</span>
(Princess Maleine), a play set in an unreal Flanders in an undetermined
time. Both were privately printed. Maeterlinck's avant-garde plays did
not gain popularity among the public but his literary colleagues in
Paris were enthusiastic. <i>Princess Maleine</i> was praised by the influential literary critic Octave Mirbeau, who announced that is was a masterpiece, "comparable<font face="Symbol">-</font>shall I dare say it?<font face="Symbol">-</font>superior in beauty to the most beautiful in Shakespeare." </p>
<p>In the1890s Maeterlinck wrote several symbolist 
dramas, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">Pelléas and Mélisande</span>,
later produced with musical setting by Claude Debussy. Maeterlinck was
furious when Georgette Leblanc (1895-1941) was replaced in the opera by
the American Mary Garden, and he wished the production will fail.
Debussy's opera was crushed in 1902 by critics, but four years later it
gained a huge success and was praised among others by the writer Romain
Rolland. In the tragic story of lovers, Maeterlinck used dark stage
sets and haunting sound effects to create an emotional response from
the audience. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius also wrote music for
the story.</p>



<p>During the summers, Maeterlinck lived quietly at Oostacher, his family's 
country home, and returned to Ghent for the rest of the year. In 1895 
Maeterlinck met Georgette Leblanc, an actress and opera singer. She was 
unable to get a divorce from her Spanish husband, but they lived together 
for the next twenty-three years. At that time Maeterlinck started to take
a more realistic approach to his subjects, leaving certain melodramatic 
aspects of symbolism. He wrote for his wife several plays: <span style="font-style: italic;">Aglavaine et Sélysette</span> (1896),<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ariane et Barbe-bleue</span> (1901), <span style="font-style: italic;">Monna Vanna</span> (1902), a historical 
drama set in the quattrocento Pisa, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Joyzelle</span>&nbsp; (1903), about victorious 
love. </p>
<p>In 1896 Maeterlinck moved from Ghent to Paris. Leblanc  took the leading role in most of his plays and she also prepared <i>The Children's Blue Bird</i>. From this period dates Maeterlinck's metaphysical essays <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Trésor des humbles</span> (1896, The Treasure of the Humble),<span style="font-style: italic;"> La sagesse et la destinée</span>
(1898, Wisdom and Destiny ) and La Vie des abeilles (1901, The Life of
the Bee), in which he examined analogies between the activity of the
bee and human behavior. Noteworthy, bee-keeping had been Maeterlinck's
hobbies since youth. In these writings Maeterlinck rejected
Schopenhaurian negativism and replaced it with a view tempered with
victorious optimism. It is possible, he though, for human being to
alter the destiny if he or she so wills. A human being is double: he or
she lives both an inner and exterior existence. "It is always a mistake
not to close one's eyes, whether to forgive or to look better into
oneself," Maeterlinck wrote in <i>Pelleas and Melisande</i>. </p>

<p>Maeterlinck's most famous play,<i> The Blue Bird,</i> was first
produced in 1908 by Konstantin Stanislavski at the Moscow Art Theater,
where it ran for nearly a year. The work, an allegorical fantasy
conceived as a play for children,
have been widely translated and adapted into screen several times. In
the story Mytyl and Tyltyl, the children of a poor woodcutter, fall
asleep after a disappointing Christmas. They dream that the fairy
Berylune sends them to find 'the bird that is blue'. They set out the
journey with a diamond with which they are able to see the souls of the
objects that surround them. The children visit the Land of Memory. In
the forest they are attacked by animals and trees but the faithful Dog
saves Tyltyl's life. The journey continues through the Palace of
Happiness and Kingdom of the Future before the children return home and
are awakened by their mother. Berlingot (the fairy Berylune), their
neighbour, begs Tyltyl's little bird for her dying children. Tyltyl
notices that the bird is blue and the one they have been looking for.
The child recovers but the bird escapes and the children ask the
audience to return it. </p>
<p> <i>The Blue Bird</i> was produced in 1909 at the Haymarket Theatre in London, rivaling in popularity J. M. Barrie's  <i>Peter Pan</i>.
A New York performance followed in October 1910 and in 1911 the play
was performed in Paris at the Théâtre Réjane, Paris. In the United
States the play was so popular that its sequel, <i>The Betrothal</i>
(1918), was first produced there. Walter Lang's film version from 1940,
starring Shirley Temple as Mytyl, vanished soon. George Cukor's remake
from 1976, starring Elizabet Taylor in four roles, was a gesture of
friendship between East and West. In this Russian-American
co-production, Russian actors were in minor roles. </p>

<p>The Swedish Academy, which awarded Maeterlinck the Nobel Prize for
Literature, was aware that a broad mass of Swedes wanted to give the
honour to <a href="strindbe.htm">August Strindberg</a>.
The previsous year the Prize had gone to Selma Lagerlöf, a minor
writer, who had been supported by the Royal Family and the Academy. An
Anti-Nobel was created for Strindberg, who refused to receive it on the
same evening as the Nobel itself.Strindberg  did not want to meet
Maeterlinck, saying: "I admire Maeterlinck's works, and have written
some fine things about them &#8211; but one should never meet. One can't talk
about what is written . . . and the rest isn't worth talking about."<br>
</p>
      <p>During World War I Maeterlinck lectured for the Allied cause in
Europe and in the United States. Before the war Maeterlinck had felt a
sympathy towards the Germans, but the invasion of Belgium changed his
attitude. His hatred and patriotic outrage against the
destroyers of his homeland he expressed in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Les Débris de la guerre</span>
(1916, The Wrack of the Storm): "No nation can be deceived that does
not wish to be deceived; and it is not intelligence German lacks . . .
No nation permits herself to be coerced to the one crime that man
cannot pardon. It is of her own accord that she hastens towards it; her
chief has no need to persuade, it is she who urges him on."
Maeterlinck's relationship with Leblanc ended and in 1919 he married
Renée Dahon, who had acted in <i>The Blue Bird</i>. They
made their home outside Paris at the Château de Médan and wintered at a
villa near Nice called Les Abeilles. Maeterlinck's interest shifted
from fantasies towards naturalistic psychological subject-matters. </p>

<p>Between the wars, Materlinck wrote essays and plays, among others <span style="font-style: italic;">La Vie des termites</span> (1926), which draws paralles between totalitarian systems and termite colonies. In 1932 Maeterlinck was made a 
count by King Albert. On the eve of World War II, Maeterlinck went to 
Portugal under the protection of Antonio Salazar and then fled to the 
United States. These years were financially hard for the writer. His works were 
ignored and he was unable to collect royalties from the sales of his books 
in Europe. In 1947 he returned to his home in Nice. Maeterlinck died of a heart attack on May 6, 1949. He was buried 
according to his agnostic world view without religious ceremonies. </p>
<p>Like the Spanis philospher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, Maeterlinck saw
that the essential enigma of the human condition is the issue of death.
His last book was <span style="font-style: italic;">Bulles bleues</span>
(1948), a collection of happy reminiscences. It has been argued, that
Maeterlinck's plays, with their unspoken dialogue, sense of fatality,
and mysteries below the everyday surface, anticipated the art of Harold
Pinter. Nevertheless, it is his essays that assured him of a vast readership after his plays went out of fashion. <font size="-1">(see Philip Mosley, in 'Introduction,' <span style="font-style: italic;">The Intelligence of Flowers</span>, 2008) </font>In <i>The Treasure of the Humble</i>, writing of an old man
sitting in his armchair, Maeterlink said that "I am persuaded that in
reality this motionless old man lives much deeper, and much human and
much broader life than the lover who strangles his mistress, the army
officer who wins a victory, or 'the the husband who avenges his
honor'." </p>
