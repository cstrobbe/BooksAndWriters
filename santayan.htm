<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Spanish-American philosopher, poet and
humanist. Santayana's principal concept was that all ideals have a
natural basis. The only reality is matter itself and that all else
arises from man's experience of, and response to, matter. Santayana's
complex commitment to artistic beauty and reason is seen in such works
as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sense of Beauty</span> (1896) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reason in Art </span>(1903), in which he states that "art in general is a rehearsal of rational living..."</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"To have imagination and taste, to love
the best, to be carried by the contemplation of nature to a vivid faith
in the ideal, all this is more, a great deal more, than any science can
hope to be. The poets and philosophers who express this aesthetic
experience and stimulate the same function in us by their example, do a
greater service to mankind and deserve higher honor than the
discoveries of historical truths." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Sense of Beauty</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>


<p>George Santayana was born in Madrid, but he spent the first years of
his life in Ávila, the medieval town in old Castile. His mother,
Josefina Borrás y Carbonell, was Spanish. She married a Boston
merchant, George Sturgis, and after his death, Augustin Ruiz de
Santayan y Reboiro, Santayana's father.
When Santayana was nine, his family moved to the United States, and
settled
in Boston. On arrival he did not speak English, though he made it his
literary language. In his new home country Santayana considered himself
only an observer. He never became an American citizen and he always
maintained a certain distance from the American culture. </p>

<p>Santayana studied at Boston Latin School, and Harvard University,  Cambridge (1882-86). 
In 1888 he was Walker Fellow in Germany and England, 
and in 1889 he received his Ph.D. At Harvard, Santayna was first Willim James's student, 
then his colleague. It has been 
often said, that they didn't like  each other and they were different in their philosophical thought, but Santayna 
appreciated James's intellectual honesty, his vitality and imagination. Santayana himself was 
socially aloof, and he felt more comfortable in the company of students than fellow professors. "He laughed not with 
his lips only, but with his whole face," recalled the daughter of his colleague. "His was a laugh to delight a 
child's heart, the laugh of Peter Pan, brimming over with pure merriment." 
<font size="2">(<i>William James: In the Maelstrom of American Modernism</i> by Robert D. Richardson, 2006, p. 286)</font>
His dissertation, which Santayna wrote in his mother's house in
Roxbury, was on the German philosopher Rudolf Hermann Lotze; originally
he planned to write on Arthur Schopenhauer, whose bleak view of the
world had much in common to that of his own. In 1896-97 he studied at
King's College, Cambridge. Santayana taught at Harvard University from
1889-1912, where his students included T.S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein,
Wallace Stevens, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Walter Lippmann. </p>
<p>Although Santayana was a popular lecturer, 
his professional career proceeded slowly. He rarely attended faculty meetings and he 
did not get along well with the powerful Harvard president, Charles William 
Eliot, who said, "... I have doubts and fears about a man so abnormal as Dr.
Santayana. The withdrawn, contemplative man who takes no part in the everyday work of the
institution, or of the world, seems to me to be a person of very uncertain future value."  
 Upon the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Life of Reason; or, The Phases of Human Progress</span>
(1905-06) Santayana was promoted from assistant to full professor, and
in 1909 he was elected to membership in the National Institute of Arts
and Letters. </p>

<p>His early poems Santayana published in <i>The Harvard Monthl</i>y. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonnets and Other Verses</span> came out in 1894, and the verse drama <span style="font-style: italic;">Lucifer: A Theological Tragedy</span> in 1899, but after<span style="font-style: italic;"> A Hermit of Carmel and Other Poems</span>
(1901), his final volume of verse, Santayana concentrated on writing
prose. In 1905-06 he was Hyde Lecturer at Sorbonne, Paris. His lectures
on the philosophy of history formed the foundation of <i>The Life of Reason</i>,
a five-volume response to Hegel's <i>Phenomenology of Mind</i> and an interpretation of the role of reason in manifold activities of the
human spirit. Santayana argued that happiness is the good for humankind and is best secured by the harmonization of our 
various interests by the use of reason. From this basis he asked,  "In which of its adventures would the human race, 
reviewing its whole experience, acknowledge a progress and a gain," and focused his survey on society, religion, 
art and science. Abstract or non-objective art he viewed with suspicion. </p>

<p> Exhausted by "thistles of trivial and narrow scholarship" and
intellectual conformism, Santayana wrote the essay 'The Genteel
Tradition in American Philosophy' (1911), stating that "To covet truth
is a very distinguished passion. Every philosopher says he is pursuing
the truth, but this is seldom the case." Santayana lived in America
until he was 50 years old, and then started his life as a "wandering
scholar." In 1912, after the death of his mother, he moved to Europe,
living three years in England, then in France, and moving finally to
Rome (1925-52). Santayana never returned to the United States. In 1923
he published
<span style="font-style: italic;">Scepticism and Animal Faith</span>,
which was acclaimed as the greatest contribution of critical realism to
epistemology. According to Santayana, all rational processes are
expressions of animal compulsion
to believe certain things, such as the existence of matter. We have an
irresistible urge ("animal faith") to believe that there exists an
external world. Further, Santayana distinguishes between existence and
being &#8211; the latter has four realms: essence, matter, truth and spirit.
Matter is external to consciousness, and all existence is grounded in
matter. Spirit and body are realizations of the same fact in
incomparable realms of being. Santayana's Platonist as well as
materialist system of philosophy is set out in the comprehensive
4-volume
<span style="font-style: italic;">Realms of Being</span> (1927-40). In its last volume,  <span style="font-style: italic;">The Reals of Spirit</span> (1940), Santayana concluded that spirit, too, is material. </p>
<p>Santayana' style was ornate but eloquent, full or metaphors, similes
and irony. Experimentation is the arts he viewed with suspicion. He
despised idealism and its spiritual home, Germany, and especially
Hegel's philosophy. Generally disillusioned about progress, Santayana's
political conservatism had also a skeptical foundation.
"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it," is his
most famous aphorism. He felt that no system of thought is to be
trusted, and wrote in the essay
'A General Confession' that "mind does not come to repeat to world but
celebrate it."
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Interpretations of Poetry and Religion</span> (1900) Santayana stated that human imagination compensates for the limitations of understanding &#8211;
art arises in response to our need for entertainment through our senses
and imagination. "Mind does not come to repeat the world but to
celebrate it." <font size="2">(from 'A General Confession', 1940) </font></p>

<p>From 1920 on, Santayana spent many winters in Rome, and then went to Cortina d'Ampezzo to escape the hot summers. 
He admired Mussolini and felt contempt 
for the British statesman Anthony Eden, calling him "an odious tyrant" and compared him to President Charles William 
Eliot. 
After the outbreak of WWII, Santayana stayed in  Italy,  like the American poet Ezra Pound, with whom he formed a 
literary friendship.  Economically he was relatively comfortable. 
He lived on the small inheritance from his mother, and on his earnings as a writer, but 
due to the war, he was cut off from his source funds in the United States. <br>
</p>
      <p>During the final years of his life, Santayana was tended by
the English sisters of the Little Company of Mary. However, he was
never a practicing Catholic. In 'The Poet's Testament' he wrote: "I
give back to earth what the earth gave, / All to the furrow, nothing to
the grave. / The candle's out, the spirit's vigil spent; / Sight may
not follow where the vision went." Santayana died in Rome on September
26, 1952. He was latent homosexual and
in private had a disdain for heterosexuality &#8211; he called it "breeding."
Santayana's autobiographical work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Personsa and Places</span> (1944-53), became a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Edmund Wilson compared it to  <i>The Education of Henry Adams </i>(1907), Yeats's memoirs and Proust's <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i> (1913-27). </p>


 
<p>Santayana wrote poems, a great deal of literary criticism, and the bestselling novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Last Puritan</span>
(1935). At the time of its appearance he was already seventy. The story
of the tragic fate of a sincere and intelligent man struggling against
Boston gentily was written over twenty years. It arose from Santayana's
dislike of what he found most
antipathetic in American life: Calvinism and Transcendentalism. The
hero is Oliver Alden, a heir of the wealthy New England family. He and
his mother are abandoned by his hedonistic drug addict-father, who
wanders about the world in his yacht. Oliver joins at the age of 17 him
for a cruise and meets Jim Darnley, a young male paid companion.
Oliver turns into a handsome and athletic critic of his decadent
surroundings. His father commits suicide. After graduation Oliver
visits the Darnleys in England and falls in love with Jim's sister
Rose, who falls in love with Mario, Oliver's European cousin. Oliver,
who has become neurotic and febrile, follows Marios example and enters
the army at the outbreak of World War I. He leaves for France and is
killed there. <b> </b></p>
