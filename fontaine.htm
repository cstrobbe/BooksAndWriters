French poet, whose <span style="font-style: italic;">Fables</span>
rank among the masterpieces of world literature, but on his death bed
La Fontaine regretted ever having written his tales. In his own time La
Fontaine was considered a vagabond, dreamer, and lover of pleasure. A
rustic character, he never was a real courtier and drifted happily from
one patron to another. Because of the universal nature of his fables,
La Fontaine's poems about industrious ants, brave lions, and carefree
grasshoppers are still widely read. The first collection of the <i>Fables
      </i>La Fontaine dedicated to the Dauphin, the grandson of Louis
XIV, for his instruction. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Never sell the bear's skin before
one has killed the beast.</b> (Fables 'L'Ours et les deux Compagnos')</font></blockquote>
      <p>Jean de La Fontaine was born in Château-Thierry, Champagne, in
central France, the son of a government official. In his youth he read
such writers as François Rabelais (1494?-1553), François de Malherbe
(1555-1628), and Honoré d'Urfé (1568-1625). He went to Paris to study
medicine and theology, but was drawn to the whirls of social life. It
was not until the end of his life that he became interested in
religion: religious rituals bored him. <br>
      </p>
      <p>La Fontaine was qualified as a
lawyer but he returned home in 1647 and assisted his father, a
superintendent of forests. He held a number of government posts, which
did not pay much money. Terribly absent-minded, he once attended
the burial of one of his friends, and sometime afterwards went to visit
him.&nbsp; On hearing about his death, he said, "It is true enough! For
now I recollect I went to his funeral." </p>
      <p>In 1647&nbsp;La
Fontaine married Marie Héricart, an heiress; the marriage was unhappy
and they separated in 1658. Deciding to become a famous writer, La
Fontaine began&nbsp;to spent his time in literary circles with <a href="moliere.htm">Molière</a>
(1622-1673) and others.&nbsp;After
leaving his family and moving to Paris, he&nbsp;spent there his most
creative years. Letters to his wife remained in his family and were
unpublished durin his lifetime. After the death of Madame de La
Fontaine, a selection of letters appeared in <span style="font-style: italic;">Oeuvres diverses de M. de la Fontaine de l'Acadèmie françoise</span> (1729).&nbsp; </p>
      <p>La Fontaine had several patrons, among them Nicolas Fouquet
(1615-1680), an influential statesman and the superintendent of
finance, who was later arrested in 1661, accused of embezzlement and
treason, and sentenced to life imprisonment &#8211; the young King, Louis
XIV, was in favor of a death sentence. With the help of Fouquet,
Fontaine received a small pension with easy terms: he had to write only
four poems in a year. When Fouquet was imprisoned, La Fontaine composed
one of his most beautiful poems, asking mercy for his&nbsp;disgraced
patron, deserted by all others. To avoid arrest, La Fontaine left Paris
and&nbsp;resided some time in Limousin, from where he wrote letters to
his wife. </p>
      <p>From 1664 to 1672 La Fontaine served as a gentleman-in-waiting
to
the dowager duchess d'Orléans in Luxemburg, and from 1673 he was a
member of the household of Mme de La Sabliere. In 1683 he was elected
to the Academie Française in recognition of his contribution to French
literature. In his welcome speech the director of the Académie told La
Fontaine that he should now glory in the King and have "no other
purpose than the eternity of his name." Thus in 1687 La Fontaine
praised the King in a poem: "He wishes to conquer Error: the / work
advances, / It is done; and the fruit of his / many successes / Is that
the Truth reigns through / out France, / And France throughout the /
universe." </p>
      <p>ALa Fontaine's other major works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Contes et nouvelles en vers</span>
(1664), a collection of tales borrowed from Italian sources, tales of
Boccaccio, Rabelais, and other medieval and renaissance masters, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Amours de Psyché et Cupidon</span>
(1669). The "Contes" often threatened to get La Fontaine in trouble
with both Church and the Academie because of its daring content. The
stories dealt with marital misdemeanors and love affairs and were not
written for readers who blushed easily. They went through four editions
during La Fontaine's lifetime, but the last edition, published
posthumously, was banned by the authorities because it was considered
too obscene. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Les Fables choisies, mises
en ver</span>s,
usually called 'La Fontaine Fables,' were published over the last 25
years of his life. The first volume,&nbsp;which came out when the
author was 47, includes some 240 poems and timeless stories of
countryfolk, heroes from Greek mythology, and familiar beasts from the
fables of Aesop, from which La Fontaine unhesitatingly borrowed his
material. Each tale has a moral &#8211; an instruction how to behave
correctly or how life should be lived. In the second volume La Fontaine
based his tales on stories from Asia and other places.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>La Fontaine's fables were marked by his love of rural life and
belief in ethical hedonism. They were widely translated and imitated
during the 17th and 18th centuries all over Europe, and beyond. Bernard
de Mandeville's translation, which contained 29 fables and was
published in 1703, was the first attempt to make La Fontaine's work
available to English readers. The complete <i>Fables</i>
by Robert Thomson appeared in 1806. It was followed by Elizur Wrigh's
rendering of the fables (1841) and Walter Thornbury's translation
(1867-70), published by Cassell in 37 parts with the illustrations of
Gustave Doré. </p>
      <p>Read nowadays mainly by children &#8211; or by teachers for their
classes
&#8211; the original amoral attitude of the fables has been forgotten. This
realistic side was still noticed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)
who considered them unfit for pedagogy. In America, the tradition of
the verse fable continued in Joel Chadler Harris' <i>Uncle Remus: His
Songs and His Sayings</i>
(1880). At the age of 71 La Fontaine became ill, and he started to
think seriously about his life. He translated the Psalms, wore a hair
shirt, and again embraced Catholicism. This new role did not convince
his friends, whom he had once&nbsp;said that pleasure is one's "primal
and congenital good." <br>
      </p>
      <p>La Fontaine died in Paris on April 13, 1695.
Before his death La Fontaine was encouraged by his abbé to condemn
publicly his indecent stories. "Stop tormenting him; he's much more
stupid than wicked," said the writer's housekeeper, but La Fontaine
obeyed the advice and also burned a comedy he had just composed. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Help yourself, and heaven will help
you. </b>(Fables 'Le Chartier Embourbe')</font><br>
        <font size="2"><b>The reason of the strongest is always the
best. </b>(Fables 'Le Loup et l'Agneau')</font><br>
        <font size="2"><b>A hungry stomach has no ears.</b> (Fables 'Le
Milan et le Rossignol)</font><br>
        <font size="2"><b>In all matters one must consider the end.</b>
(Fables 'Le Renard et le Bouc')</font></blockquote>
      <p>In <i>Fables choisier, mises en vers</i>
(Selected Fables, Set in Verse, 1668, 1678-16679, 1694) La Fontaine
viewed life and society ironically. By means of animal symbols and
witty dialogues, written in colloquial turns of speech, he examined
different social types, ambitions, vices and virtues. "Sometimes I
oppose, by a double image / Vice and virtue, foolishness and good
sense, / The Lambs to the violent / wolves, / The Fly to the Ant:
making of this work / An ample comedy in a hundred different acts / Of
which the scene is the / universe." However, La Fontaine's fables are
not only meant for moral lessons, but also show the pleasure of telling
and mastery of a great variety of tones. Animal figures gave La
Fontaine enough freedom to distance himself from contemporary,
inflammable issues. Several of the fables were based on the <i>Decameron</i>,
      <i>Cent nouvelles nouvelles</i>, and the Middle Ages and
renaissance tales. Since their appearance, the <i>Fables</i>
have been illustrated by a number of artists from different countries,
including Gustave Doré, Marc Chagall, and Salvador Dalí.&nbsp;</p>
