<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Norwegian novelist, short story writer,
and poet, who gained fame in his homeland and other European countries before
and after World War II. Tarjei Vesaas wrote his works in New Norwegian (<I>nynorsk</I>), formerly known as <I>landsm&aring;l</I>, "rural language." He published several books before his first significant success, <EM>Det store spelet</EM> (1934, The Great Cycle), in which the protagonist Per Bufast refuses to accept his ordained destiny. Vesaas spent most of his life in the province of Telemark. His wife Halldis Vesaas also was a writer.</P>

<P>Tarjei Vesaas was born in Vinje, Telemark, an isolated place a good six hundred meters above sea level. 
He was the oldest son of the family, expected to take over farm, where the family 
had lived for 300 hundred years in the same house, 
passed down from father to son through the centuries. Vesaas was educated at a folk high school (1917-18). 
In the 1920s he travelled abroad, mostly in Germany, with the help of a travel grant. From 1927 he lived in his birth-region. </P>
<P>Vesaas began his literary career in the early 1920s, when he published his first 
books,&nbsp;<EM>Menneskebonn</EM> (1923), <EM>Sendemann Huskuld</EM> (1924), and <EM>Guds bustader</EM> (1925). These were 
closely tied to the traditional <I>nynorsk </I>literature. In the 1930s he wrote several realistic novels, 
among them <I>The Great Cycle</I>, which depicted traditional life in the countryside, 
and&nbsp;<EM>Kvinnor ropar heim</EM> (1935), partly based on his own marriage to the poet Halldis Moren Vesaas.&nbsp;
<EM>Fars reise</EM> (1930), <EM>Sigrid Stallbrokk</EM> (1931), and <EM>Dei ukjende mennene</EM> (1932) 
formed the so-called Klas Dyregodt tetralogy. </P>
<P>Halldis's influence was crucial for the author, especially in helping him to win depression 
and suicidal thoughts about drowning, which was seen in some of his novels form the 1930s. 
Also the atmosphere in her books was often in the 1930s oppressive, foreboding a catastrophe. 
In the 1940s Vesaas's works became more symbolical and allegorical. </P>
<P>The central themes in Vesaas's works were loneliness, guilt, psychological 
isolation, and death. Like in typical Scandinavian films, people do not say what they 
think but the silence is full of meanings. Many of Vesaas's characters seem to be driven 
by unchained inner forces. The solution offered to their problems is the process of 
growing up, of learning, as in <I>The Great Cycle. </I>The protagonist of the novel is Per Bufast, the oldest son of a farm family. He rebels against his destiny to take over the farm when his father dies. Per dreams of the many possibilities in the wide world, but finally he realizes that he will spent on the farm the rest of his life. </P>
<P>In the play&nbsp;<EM>Ultimatum</EM> (1934) Vesaas expressed his fear of the 
approaching international conflict. Through five young people waiting to see whether 
their country will go to war, Vesaas advocated his pacifist view.&nbsp;<EM>Kimen</EM> (1940, The Seed), 
set on a peaceful island, explored the violence and irrationality in the human soul, as 
Norway had just was drawn into World War II. A mentally disturbed man has killed a girl 
and a lynching party in a peaceful island community starts to hunt him. Vesaas 
underlined, that violence must be countered by rational reflection <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> 
otherwise primitive hatred takes power over the people. </P>
<P>During the German occupation, Vesaas buried manuscipts in the earth until liberation 
came. He wrote <EM>Huset i m&oslash;rkret</EM> (1945, The House in the Dark), and allegorical story 
of the nature of the evil and Norway's struggle against invasion. The occupied Norway is 
symbolized by a large house, where the "Arrow people" terrorize the other inhabitants. </P>

<P>After Halldis Moren gave him a volume of selected poems by 
 <A href="../../../sodergra.htm">Edith S&ouml;dergran</A>, 
Vesaas tried writing poem, too. "But nothing came out it, no really serious poems 
came," Vesaas later said, "no more now than before. They lay gestating somewhere for fourteen 
years. Then they sprang out again for some unknown reason and became the first attempts at 
poems in <I>Kjeldene</I> [The Springs]." <FONT size=2>(Vesaas in <I>Through Naked Branches</I>, 
tr. by Roger Greenwald, 2000)</FONT> 

From the late 1940s Vesaas began to publish poetry regularly. His early 
poems were written in more or less traditional vein, but later he approached modernism 
and as in his novels, Vesaas's 
writing became more intense and restrained. During his lifetime, Vesaas published five 
collections of poetry. In 2000 appeared Roger Greenwald's selection of the author's poetry, 
entitled <I>Through Naked Branches</I>. It won the American-Scandinavian Foundation Translation Prize.</P>

<P>Vesaas's works from the 1950s include <EM>Fuglane</EM> (1957, The Birds), which tells the moving story of 
a mentally retarded man, Mattis, who has an innate feel for poetry. Mattis is thirty'seven, an 
outsider doomed to loneliness. He lives with his sister, Hege, who is slightly older and who 
takes care of him. When she falls in love with a lumberman, J&oslash;rgen, Mattis realizes how 
Hege's life is full of frustrations. Eventually Mattis's confused actions lead to his 
destruction. One of the central symbols of the story is a woodcock, which brings a message 
from unexplained realms of life: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>Mattis bent down and read what was written. Looked at the graceful dancing footprints. That's how fine and graceful the bird is, he thought. That's how gracefully my bird walks over the marshy ground when he's tired of the air.</B></FONT><B><BR>
<FONT size=2>You are you, that was what was written. </FONT><BR>
<FONT size=2>What a greeting to receive</FONT><FONT size=2>. </FONT></B><FONT size=2></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In&nbsp;<EM>V&aring;rnatt</EM>&nbsp;(1954, Spring Night) Vesaas brought the story to realistic level. 
The events take place in one spring night and the morning after and deal with basic questions 
of life <FONT face=Symbol><FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT></FONT> birth and death, family relationship 
and feeling of rejection. All everyday events are seen from the point of view of a fourteen-year-old boy, behind whose 
observations the reader can anticipate deeper, transcendental meanings.<B> </B>"In the open patches between 
the trees grew patches of angelica – and it was these large flowers more than anything else that had drawn Olaf to this 
spot so often throughout his boyhood. He would not have been able to explain what there was between him and them, 
but for him they were wonderful plants as they stood bristling grotesquely with their bursting wheels of 
blossom." <FONT size=2></FONT><FONT size=2></FONT></P>
<P><EM>Vindane</EM> (1952),&nbsp;a collection of stories,&nbsp;won the Venice Prize and <EM>Is-slottet</EM> (1963, The Ice Palace), a captivating novel open to many interpretations, received the Nordic Literary Prize. Peter Owen, its British publisher, described it as "the best novel I ever published". The story focuses on two eleven-year-old girls, Siss and Unn, who became friends. Although there is a strong bond between them, their personalities are complete different or reflect different aspects of the same personality <FONT face=Symbol><FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT></FONT> Siss is a leader, Unn is shy and introverted. Unn discovers the 'Ice Palace,' a formation of ice created by a waterfall.<B><FONT size=2> </FONT></B>"Unn looked down into an enchanted world of small pinnacles, gables, frosted domes, soft curves and curved tracery. All of it was ice, and the water spurted between, building it up continually. Branches of the waterfall had been diverted and rushed into new channels, creating new forms. Everything shone." At the very beginning of their friendship they are separated by the death of Unn in the strange world of ice. Siss is left alone to come to terms with her loss. But she is also attracted by the Ice Palace. "We all are pied pipers, tempted to gather here by irresistible things," Siss thinks before she is destroyed by the temptation. </P>
<P>Vesaas's late work<EM> B&aring;ten om kvelden</EM> (1968, The Boat in the Evening), a collection of semi-autobiographical sketches, which reviewed themes that had fascinated him throughout his life, mysterious threats and the spiritual condition of the individual. Vesaas portrays his own psychological development from his early realization of human isolation to his acceptance of death. These thoughts also marked his last volume of poetry,<EM> Liv ved straumen</EM> (1970). Except periods of travel in Scandinavia and on the European continent, Vesaas spent his whole life in the farm community of Vinje, where he died on March 15, 1970. </P>
<P>Vesaas's books have been translated into all Scandinavian languages and in English, German, French, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Latvian, Czechoslovakian etc. He was repeatedly named as a potential candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature; in 1964 he was one of four nominees for the prize. Elizabeth Rokkan has translated several of Vesaas's novels into English, and his last work, <I>The Boat in the Evening</I> (1967). </P>
