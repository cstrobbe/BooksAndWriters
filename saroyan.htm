<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author whose stories celebrated optimism in the middle of trials and difficulties of the Depression-era. Several of Saroyan's works were drawn from his own experiences, although his approach to autobiographical facts can be called poetic. His advice to a young writer was: "Try to learn to breathe deeply; really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep really to sleep. Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell." Saroyan worked tirelessly to perfect a prose style, that was full of zest of for life and was seemingly impressionistic. The style became known as 'Saroyanesque.' </P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><STRONG>"The writer is a spiritual anarchist, as in the depth of his soul every man is. He is discontented with everything and everybody. The writer is everybody's best friend and only true enemy&nbsp;</STRONG>–<STRONG> the good and great enemy. He neither walks with the multitude nor cheers with them. The writer who is a writer is a rebel who never stops." </STRONG>(from <I>The William Saroyan Reader</I>, 1958) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><B></B>


<P>William Saroyan was born in Fresno, California,&nbsp; the son of an Armenian 
immigrant. His father moved to New Jersey in 1905&nbsp;– he was a small vineyard owner, who had been educated as a Presbyterian minister. In the new country he was forced to 
take farm-labouring work. He died in 1911 from peritonitis, after drinking 
a forbidden glass of water given by his wife, Takoohi. Saroyan was put in 
an orphanage in Alameda with his brothers. Six years later the family reunited in 
Fresno, where Takoohi had obtained work in a cannery. </P>

<P>In 1921 Saroyan attended the Technical School in order to learn to type. At the age of fifteen, Saroyan left the school. His mother had showed 
him some of his fathers writings, and he decided to become a writer.
Saroyan continued his education by reading and writing on his own, and supporting himself by odd jobs. At the San Francisco Telegraph Company he worked as an office manager. 
A few of his early short articles were published in <I>The Overland Monthly</I>. His first collected stories started to appear in the 1930s. Among these 
 was 'The Broken Wheel,' which was written under the name Sirak Goryan. It was published in the Armenian journal <I>Hairenik </I>in 1933.&nbsp;<FONT size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P>As a writer Saroyan made his breakthrough in the <I>Story</I> magazine with 'The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze' (1934), after the popular song. The protagonist is a young, starving writer who tries to survive in a Depression-ridden society. "<I>Through the air on the flying trapeze</I>, his mind hummed. Amusing it was, astoundingly funny. A trapeze to God, or to nothing, a flying trapeze to some sort of eternity; he prayed objectively for strength to make the flight with grace." Saroyan's character has some connections to <A href="khamsun.htm">Knut Hamsun</A>'s penniless writer in his famous novel <I>Hunger</I> (1890), but without the anger and nihilism of Hamsun's narrator. The story was republished in Saroyan's bestselling collection, and with its royalties Saroyan financed his trip to Europe and Armenia, where he learned to love the taste of Russian cigarettes. He also developed a theory that "you <I>may</I> tend to get cancer from the thing that makes you want to smoke so much, not from the smoking itself." <FONT size=2>(from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Not Dying</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1963) </FONT></P>
<P>Many of Saroyan's stories were based on his childhood, experiences among the Armenian-American fruit growers of the San Joaquin Valley, or dealt with the rootlessness of the immigrant. The short story collection <EM>My Name Is Aram </EM>(1940), 
an international bestseller, was about a young boy, Aram Garoghlanian, and the colorful characters of his immigrant family. It has been translated among others into Finnish. </P>

<P>As a playwright Saroyan's work was drawn from deeply personal sources. He disregarded the conventional idea of conflict as essential to drama. <EM>My Heart in the Highlands </EM>(1939), his first play, was a comedy about a young boy and his Armenian family. It was produced at the Guild Theatre in New York. Among Saroyan's best known plays is <EM>The Time of Your Life&nbsp;</EM> (1939), 
set in a waterfront saloon in San Francisco. It won a Pulitzer Prize. Saroyan refused the honor, on the grounds that commerce
should not judge the arts, but accepted the New York Drama Critics Circle award. In 1948 the play was adapted into screen, starring James Gagney. </P>
<P><EM>The Human Comedy </EM>(1943) was set in Ithaca, in California's San Joaquin Valley, where the young Homer, a telegraph messenger, becomes a witness of sorrows and joys of small town people during World War II. "Mrs. Sandoval," Homer said swiftly, "your son is dead. Maybe it's a mistake. Maybe it wasn't your son. Maybe it was somebody else. The telegram<I> says</I> it was Juan Domingo. But maybe the telegram is wrong." <FONT size=2>(from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>The Human Comedy</FONT></I><FONT size=2>)</FONT> The story was bought by 
MGM and made Saroyan's shaky financial situation more secure. 
Louis B. Mayer had purchased the story for $60,000 and gave 
Saroyan $1,500 a week for his work as producer-director. After 
seeing Saroyan's short film, Mayer gave the direction to Clarence 
Brown. The sentimental final sequence of the Oscar-winning film, 
starring Mickey Rooney and Frank Morgan, has been 
called "the most embarrassing moment in the whole 
history of movies."<FONT size=2> 
( David Shipman in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>The Story of Cinema</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, vol. 2, 1984) </FONT>Before 
the war Saroyan had worked at one point on the screenplay of <I>Golden Boy</I> (1939), based on Clifford Odet's 
play, but he never gained much success in Hollywood, although his screenplay for <I>The Human Comedy</I> won the 
an Oscar for Best Original Motion Picture Story. The film was also nominated for best picture, best director, best 
cinematography and best actor. </P>

<P>Saroyan also published 
essays and memoirs, in which he depicted the people he had met on travels in the 
Soviet Union and Europe, such as the playwright 
<A href="gbshaw.htm">George Bernard Shaw</A>, the Finnish composer 
Jean Sibelius, and Charlie Chaplin. During World War II Saroyan joined the US army. He was stationed in Astoria, Queens, but he spent much of his time at the Lombardy Hotel in Manhattan, far from the Army personnel. In 1942 he was posted to 
London in as a part of a film unit and narrowly avoided a court
martial, when his novel <EM>The Adventures of Wesley Jackson </EM>(1946) turned 
out to be pacifist.</P>

<P>Saroyan was well acquainted with the San Francisco night life, and had enjoyed multiple short lived "affairs" or one-night stands.&nbsp;According to a story, when a woman in Hollywood refused a late night telephone invitation to his bed, Saroyan was reportedly to have asked, if she had a sister who would comply. In his mid-thirties&nbsp;Saroyan married the seventeen-years-old Carol Marcus; they had two children, Aram and Lucy. Carol was blond, voluptious and witty, her mother was Russian and step-father of German-Jewish origin. When&nbsp;she revealed that she was Jewish and illegitimate, Saroyan 
divorced. They remarried again and divorced. Lucy became an 
actress. Aram became a poet, who published a book about his father. Carol Marcus married later the actor Walter Matthau. </P>


<P>After WW II, Saroyan's financial situation did not improve, when 
interest in his novels declined and he was criticized for sentimentalism. Saroyan praised freedom; brotherly love and universal benevolence were for him basic values, but with his idealism Saroyan was considered more or less out of date. However, he wrote prolifically. "How could you you write so much good stuff and still write such bad stuff?" asked one of his readers. 
 In 1952 Saroyan published the first of several book-length memoirs,<EM> The Bicycle Rider in Beverly Hills</EM>. In the title novella of <EM>The Assyrian, and Other Stories </EM>(1950) and in <EM>The Laughing Matter </EM>(1953) Saroyan mixed allegorical elements within a realistic novel. The plays <EM>Sam Ego's House </EM>(1949) and <EM>The Slaughter of the Innocents </EM>(1958) examined moral questions, but they did not gain the success of his prewar works. When Saroyan joked on Ernest Hemingway's <I>Death in the Afternoo</I>n, Heminway responded: "We've seen them come and go. Good ones too. Better ones than you, Mr. Saroyan." </P>
<P>Many of Saroyan's later plays, such as <EM>The Paris Comedy </EM>(1960), <EM>The London Comedy </EM>(1960), and<EM> Settled Out Court </EM>(1969), premiered in Europe. A number of his plays, now housed at Stanford University with his other papers, have never been performed. Saroyan worked rapidly, hardly editing his text. Much of his earnings he spent in drinking and gambling. From 1958 the author lived mainly in Paris, where he had an apartment. "I am an estranged man, said the liar: estranged from myself, from my family, my fellow man, my country, my world, my time, and my culture. I am not estranged from God, although I am a disbeliever in everything about God excepting God indefinable, inside all and careless of all." <FONT size=2>(from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Here Comes There Goes You Know Who</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1961)</FONT> In the late 1960s and
the 1970s Saroyan managed to write himself out of debt and create substantial income. Saroyan died from cancer on May 18, 1981, 
in Fresno. "Everybody has got to die," he had said, "but I have always believed an exception would be made in my case." Half of his ashes were buried in California, and the rest in 
Armenia.</P>
