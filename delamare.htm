<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British novelist and poet, loosely connected
with the literary tradition of Wordsworth and Coleridge. De la Mare's
reputation as a poet was established by the volume <span style="font-style: italic;">The Listeners and
Other Poems</span> (1912). Vita Sackville-West once called him a "poet of
dusk". De la Mare wrote for both children and adults. His best-known
novel is <span style="font-style: italic;">Memoirs of a Midget</span>
(1921), which described sympathetically the world of the minute Miss M.
or Miss Thomasina, who is regarded as a freak. The book won the James
Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1922. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Look thy last on all things lovely,
        </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Every hour &#8211; let no night </font><br>
        <font size="2">Seal thy sense in deathly slumber </font><br>
        <font size="2">Till to delight </font><br>
        <font size="2">Thou hast paid thy utmost blessing. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Fare Well,' 1918) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Walter de la Mare was born at Charlton, Kent, in the south of
England, of well-to-do parents. His father, James Edward Delamare (as
the name was originally spelled), was an official of the Bank of
England. His mother, Lucy Sophia (Browning), was related to the poet
Robert Browning. He was educated in London at St. Paul's Cathedral
Choir School, which he left aged 16. From 1890 to 1908 he worked in
London in the accounting department of the Anglo-American Oil Company.
His career as a writer started in about 1895 and he continued to
publish to the end of his life. His first published story, 'Kismet'
(1895), appeared in the <i>Sketch</i> under the pseudonym Walter
Ramal. </p>
      <p>In 1908 de la Mare was awarded a yearly government pension of
£100, and he devoted himself entirely to writing. He retired to Taplow
in Buckinghamshire, where he lived quietly with his wife, Constance
Elfrida Ingpen (died 1943), and four children. De la Mare's eldest son
Richard became Chairman of Faber &amp; Faber, and published several of
his father's books. The slaughter of WWI left a weariness in his work
for a long period. "Heavenly Archer, bend thy bow; / Now the flame of
life burns low, / Youth is gone; I, too, would go" he wrote in a poem <font size="2">(in 'Dust to Dust', </font><i><font size="2">Motley</font></i><font size="2">, 1918)</font>. From 1940 until his death, he had a flat at
South End House, Montpelier Row. De la Mare received the CH in 1948,
and the OM in 1953. He died in Twickenham, near London, on June 22,
1958. De la Mare is buried in St Paul's Cathedral. </p>
      <p>His first stories and poems de la Mare wrote for periodicals,
for <i>The Sketch </i>amongst others, and published in 1902 a
collection of poetry, <span style="font-style: italic;">Songs of
Childhood</span>, under the name Walter Ramal. It attracted little
notice. Subsequently de la Mare published many volumes of poetry for
both adults and children. In 1904 there appeared under his own name the
prose romance <span style="font-style: italic;">Henry Brocken</span>,
in which the young hero sets out an allegorical journey. Brocken
encounters fictional characters and writers from the past, but he is
eventually cast back from the booklands to mortality. A similar theme
about the relationship between real and fictional was taken up in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Return</span> (1910), an eerie story
of spirit possession. Arthur Lawford suspects that an
eighteenth-century pirate, Nicholas Sabathier, is seizing control of
his personality. "'Here lie ye bones of one, Nicholas Sabathier,' he
began murmuring again &#8211; 'merely bones, mind you; brains and heart are
quite another story. And it's pretty certain the fellow had some kind
of brains. Besides, poor devil, he killed himself. That seems to hint
at brains..." </p>
      <p>De la Mare's first successful book was<i> The Listeners</i>;
the title poem is one of his most anthologized pieces. In the work
supernatural presence haunts the solitary Traveller, the typical
speaker of his poems: "Is there anybody there? said the Traveller, /
Knocking on the moonlit door; / And his horse in the silence champed
the grasses / Of the forest's ferny floor.... / But no one descended to
the Traveller; / No head from the leaf-fringed sill / Leaned over and
looked into his grey eyes, / Where he stood perplexed and still."Mare
often described the English sea and coast, the secret and hidden world
of nature. His favorite themes, childhood, death, dreams, commonplace
objects and events, de la Mare examined with a touch of mystery and
often with an undercurrent of melancholy. His novels have been
reprinted many times in horror collections because of their sense of
wonder, and also hidden malevolence. However, de la Mare did not have
the morbid atmosphere of Poe, but his dreamlike visions had many
similarities to Blake. </p>
      <p>During de la Mare's lifetime, no full-length feature films
were produced from his writings. The short story 'What Dreams May Come'
(1936) was adapted for the TV series <i>Tales of Tomorrow</i> in 1953.
'Seaton's Aunt', a tale of vampirism written about 1909, was filmed in
1983 in the Granada Television series <i>Shades of Darkness</i>.
Though not based on his work but on a play by R.A. Dick (Josephine
Leslie, 1898-1979), <i>The Ghost and Mrs Muir </i>(1947)
contains many of the fantasy elements typical for a de la Mare story,
such as the bondage between the material world and the spirit world. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Three jolly gentlemen, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">In coats of red, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Rode their horses </font><br>
        <font size="2">Up to bed. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'The Huntsmen', <i>Peacock Pie: A Book of
Rhymes</i>, 1913) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Among de la Mare's books of children verse and stories are
Peacock Pie: A Book of Rhymes (1913) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Broomsticks and Other Tales</span> (1925).
One of de la Mare's most successful books for children was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Three Mulla Mulgars</span> (1910),
which told a story of three royal monkeys on a long journey. Later this
animal fantasy was retitled <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Three Royal Monkeys</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Come Hither</span> (1923),
which contains over 800 pages and covers approximately 600 years of
literature in English, is a widely admired anthology for children. W.H.
Auden said of it, "I remember very well the appearance, when I was a
schoolboy, of <i>Come Hither</i>, a collection which, more than any
book I have read before or since, taught me what poetry is"<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">The New Republic</font></i><font size="2">, Dec. 27, 1939)</font>. Instead of an introduction, this
anthology begins with a piece of autobiographical fiction, 'The Story
of This Book'. The poems are gathered in sixteen separate sections; the
titles have their own inner logic: "Morning and May", "Feasts: Fairs:
Beggars: Gypsies", "Summer: Greenwood: Solitude", "Dance, Music and
Bells", and so on. The final section, "About and Roundabout" consists
of 300 pages of notes on the poems. </p>
      <p>De la Mare wrote about 100 short stories. The major
collections include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Riddle and
Other Stories</span> (1923), <span style="font-style: italic;">On the
Edge</span> (1930), and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Beginning
and Other Stories </span>(1955). His early pieces were posthumously
assembled as <span style="font-style: italic;">Eight Tales</span>
(1971). From the mid-1930s de la Mare wrote no more short stories, but
focused on poetry. Never feeling any need to experiment, he used the
old forms, the sonnet, the quatrain. Graham Greene has argued that de
la Mare was more interesting as a prose writer than a poet. Dylan
Thomas was also an admirer of his fiction. Essays and critical work
include studies of R. Brooke (1919) and Lewis Carroll-L.C. Dodgson
(1932), and an edition of C. Rossetti in 1930. De la Mare was one of
the legatees of his fellow poet <a href="rbrooke.htm">Rupert Brooke</a>.</p>
