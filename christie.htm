<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Very prolific British author of
mystery novels and short stories, creator of Hercule Poirot, the
Belgian detective, and Miss Jane Marple. Christie wrote more than 70
detective novels under the surname of her first husband, Colonel
Archibald Christie. She also published a series of romances and a
children's book. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"And now, messieurs et mesdames,"
said Poirot rapidly, "I will continue with what I was about to say.
Understand this, I mean to arrive at the truth. The truth, however ugly
in itself, is always curious and beautiful to seeker after it. I am
much aged, my powers may not be what they were." Here he clearly
expected a contradiction. "In all probability this is the last case I
shall ever investigate. But Hercule Poirot does not end with a failure.
Messieurs at mesdames, I tell you, I mean to </b></font><b><i><font size="2">know</font></i><font size="2">. And I shall know&nbsp;&#8211;</font><font size="2"> in spite of you all."' </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</font></i><font size="2">, 1926) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay, in the county of Devon,
the daughter of Frederick Alvah Miller, an American with a moderate
private income, and Clarissa Boehmer Miller, the daughter of an army
Captain.&nbsp;Christie's father died when she was a eleven years of
age. She once described him as "a very amusing father, always doing
nothing." From childhood, Christie was encouraged to write by her
mother.&nbsp;Most of the characters in these early efforts&nbsp;died
off before the end of the story.</p>
      <p>Christie was first educated at home, and at sixteen she was
sent to school in Paris, where she studied singing and piano.&nbsp;She
was an accomplished pianist but her stage fright and shyness prevented
her from pursuing a career in music. Christie remained shy
and&nbsp;withdrawn individual throughout her life.<strong> </strong>In
her books Christie seldom referred to music, although her detectives,
Poirot and Miss Marple, show interest in opera and Poirot sings in <em>The
A.B.C. Murders</em> (1936) a World War I song. When Christie's mother
took her to Cairo for a winter, she wrote there a novel. Encouraged by
Eden Philpotts, neighbor and friend in Torquay, she devoted herself
into writing and had short stories published. </p>
      <p>In 1914 Christie married Archibald Christie, an officer in the
Flying Royal Corps; their daughter, Rosalind, was born in 1919. During
World War I she worked in a Red Cross Hospital in Torquayas a hospital
dispenser, which gave her a knowledge of poisons. It was to be useful
when she&nbsp;started to develop the plots of her&nbsp;mysteries.
Christie's first detective novel, <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i>,
introduced Hercule Poirot, the Belgian detective, who appeared in more
than 40 books, the last of which was <em>Curtain </em>(1975). The
Christies bought a house and named it 'Styles' after the first
novel.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Poirot is an amiably&nbsp;eccentric character, whose friend
Captain Hastings represents the "idiot narrator"&nbsp;&#8211; familiar from
Sherlock Holmes stories. After the German invasion of Belgium in 1914,
Poirot, a former policeman, was forced to flee his
country.&nbsp;Eventually Poirot settled to London's Whitehaven
Mansions. Poirot is short &#8211; only five feet four inches tall. He has
waxed moustache, egg-shaped head and small feet.&nbsp;Poirot draws
conclusions from observing people's conduct&nbsp; and from objects
around him, creating a chain of facts that finally reveal the murderer.
'"He tapped his forehead. "These little gray cells. It is 'up to them'
&#8211; as you say over here."' Behind the apparently separate details is
always a pattern, which only Poirot is able to see.</p>
      <p><em>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</em>&nbsp; had a great success
on the London stage in 1928. Charles Laughton was cast in the role
of&nbsp;Poirot, but&nbsp;Austin Trevor was chosen to play&nbsp;the
Belgian sleuth&nbsp;for the film version. Trevor's accent was fine, but
he was taller and younger than the character in the books and he did
not have a moustache.&nbsp;His debut on film Poirot made in <i>Alibi </i>(1931,
adapted from the novel <em>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</em> (1926) and
produced by Twickenham Film Studios. As for the story, it partly
inspired by Anton Chekhov's <i>The Shooting Party</i> (1884-1885).
"Every murderer is probably somebody's old friend,"
Christie&nbsp;argued in it. </p>
      <p>Christie's marriage broke up in 1926. Archie Christie, who
worked in the City, announced that he had fallen in love with a younger
woman, Nancy Neele. In the same year Christie's beloved mother died.
After hearing that her husband had left for Miss Neele's house,
Christie disappeared for a time. "I would gladly give £500 if I could
only hear where my wife is," said Colonel Christie. The story of her
real life (love?) adventure in the 1926, when she lived in a Harrowgate
hotel under the name Mrs. Teresa Neele, was basis for the film <em>Agatha</em>
(1978), directed by Michael Apted. In title role was Vanessa Redgrave.
Doctors who examined Christie claimed that&nbsp;her loss of memory was
genuine&nbsp;&#8211; "a classic case of amnesia resulting from overstain."
Much of the next two years she spent traveling. </p>
      <p>Christie's divorce was finalized in 1928, and two years later
she married the archaeologist Max Mallowan. She had met him on her
travels in Near East in 1927, and accompanied him on his excavations of
sites in Syria and Iraq. Later Christie used these exotic settings in
her novels <em>Murder in Mesopotamia</em>&nbsp;(1936) and <i>Death on
the Nile</i> (1937). With Max Mallowan&nbsp; Christie traveled in 1947
and 1949 to expeditions to Nimrud, the ancient capital of Assyria, and
in the Tigris Valley. Her own archeological adventures were recounted
in <em>Come, Tell Me How You Live</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1946). Mallowan was
Catholic and fourteen years her junior; he became one of the most
prominent archaeologist of his generation. Of her marriage the writer
is quoted of having said: "An archaeologist is the best husband any
woman can have. The older she gets, the more interested he is in her."
However, most likely Christie&nbsp;never made this kind
of&nbsp;personal remark. Mallowan worked in Iraq in the 1950s but
returnmed to England, when Christie's health grew weaker. His most
famous book was <i>Nimrud and its Remains</i>. </p>
      <p>Christie's most prolific period began in the late 1920s.
During the 1930s he published four non-series mystery novels, fourteen
Poirot novels, two Marple novels, two Superintendent Battle books, a
book of stories featuring Harley Quin and another featuring Mr. Parker
Pyne, an additional Mary Westmacott book, and two original
plays.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>After visiting Luxor in 1937, where Christie saw Howard
Carter,&nbsp;she wrote the play <em>Akhnaton</em>, which was not
published until 1973. It dramatized the fate of the Egyptian pharaoh
Akhnaton, who tried to replace the old gods with monotheism, and
Nefertiti, his wife. Curiously, the Finnish writer <a href="mwaltari.htm">Mika Waltari</a>, who gained later international
fame with his historical novel <i>The Egyptian</i> (1945), wrote also
in the same year a play about the same king, <i>Akhnaton, auringosta
syntynyt </i>(1937), but he never traveled in Egypt. Christie's play
was prodeced in New York as <i>Akhnaton and Nefertiti </i>in 1979 and
next year in London. </p>
      <p>During WW II Christie worked in the dispensary of University
College Hospital in London, broadening there her knowledge of poisons.
She also produced twelve completed novels. After the war she continued
to write prolifically, also gaining success on the stage and in the
cinema, but she never wrote an original screenplay. <i>Witness for the
Prosecution</i>, for example, was chosen the best foreign play of the
1954-55 season by the New York Drama Critics Circle.&nbsp;First
staged&nbsp;in London in October 1953, it was on Broadway by December
1954. </p>
      <p>Among the film adaptations of Christie's novels on Hercule
Poirot are the&nbsp; phenomenally successful&nbsp;<i>Murder&nbsp;on the
Orient Express</i> (1974), directed by Sidney Lument and with Albert
Finney as Poirot, and <i>Death on the Nile</i> (1978), with Peter
Ustinov as the sleuth. Both films were nostalgic costume dramas. Sidney
Lumet&nbsp;said in his book <i>Making Movies</i> (1995) that clothes
contribute an enormus amount to the style of the picture. "When Betty
Bacall makes her first appearance in <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>,
she's wearing a full-length peach-colored bias-cut velvet dress with a
matching hat and egret feather. Jacqueline Bisset, for her first
appearance, wears a full-length blue silk dress, a matching jacket with
a white ermine collar, and a tiny pillbox hat with a feather... The
object was to thrust the audience into a world it never knew&nbsp;&#8211; to
create a feeling of how glamorous things used to be." Even the small
parts in<i> Murder on the Orient Express</i> was filled by famous
stars. Richard Widmark was the victim, Lauren Bacall the American
matron, Vanessa Redgrave the lady with the husband, Ingrid Berman the
nurse, and John Gielgud the Jeeves character. Also Sean Connery and
Anthony Perkins were in the cast.</p>
      <p>Peter Ustinov played&nbsp;the legendary detective in such
films as <i>Death on the Nile</i>, <i>Evil under the Sun</i> (1982),
and <i>Appointment with Death</i> (1988) and then David
Suchet&nbsp;continued in&nbsp;the role, becoming the definitive Poirot.
Tony Randall&nbsp;was Poirot in Frank Tashlin's unorthodox adaptation <i>The
Alphabet Murders</i> (1966), in which Anita Ekberg galloped on
horseback through Kensington Gardens. Originally Zero Mostel, who had
been victimized by the Hollywood blacklist&nbsp;from the
1950s,&nbsp;was cast as Poirot, but the producers changed&nbsp;their
minds. Allegedly Christie presented some objections, too. In <i>Murder
by the Book</i> (1986) Ian Holm's Poirot meets Agatha Christie while
investigating his own murder. Learning from the manuscript that he dies
of a heart attack, he asks Christie to shoot him rather than kill him
off the way she had planned. </p>
      <p>Miss Jane Marple made her first screen appearance in <em>Murder
She Said</em> (1962), based on the novel <em>4:50 from Paddington</em>
(1957), starring Dame Margaret Rutherford. Christie herself felt the
Rutherford was physically all wrong to play the sharp spinster, but the
audience loved her performance.&nbsp; Other films fallowed:&nbsp;<i>Murder
at the Galop </i>(1963), <i>Murder Ahoy</i> (1964), and <i>Murder
Most Foul </i>(1964), all smoothly directed by George Pollock. The BBC
TV series starring Joan Hickson ran 1984-87. Gracie Fields, a popular
British stage and music hall singer, actress and
comedienne,&nbsp;played Miss Marple on television in an adaptation of <i>A
Murder Is Announced</i> (1956).</p>
      <p>Miss Marple, an elderly spinster, was a typical English
character, but when Poirot used logic and rational methods, Marple
relied on her feminine sensitivity and empathy to solve crimes. She was
born and lived in the village of St. Mary Mead. Both Poirot and Marple
did not have any family life, but Poirot also travelled much. Captain
Hastings married in the early 1930s, but it seems that he had more fun
in the company of Poirot than at home. Marple was featured in 17
novels, the first being <em>Murder at the Vicarage</em> (1930) and the
last <em>Sleeping Murder</em>&nbsp;(1977). Her model was reportedly
the author's own grandmother. </p>
      <p>Tommy Beresford and Tuppence Cowley were introduced in <em>The
Secret Adversary</em> (1922). They became the first husband and wife
team of crime solvers. The mysterious Harley Quin made his appearance
in short stories, which were collected in <em>The Mysterious Mr. Quin</em>
(1930). Though Christie liked the character, she stopped writing Quin
stories after the 1920s. In 1930 she published the first of six
psychological romance novels, <em>Giant's Bread</em>, under the
pseudonym Mary Westmacott.</p>
      <p>In 56 years Christie wrote 66 detective novels, among the best
of which are <i>The Murder of Roger Acroyd,</i> <em>Murder on the
Orient Express</em> (1934), <em>Death on the Nile</em> (1937), and <em>Ten
Little Niggers</em> (1939). The film&nbsp;adaptation of <em>Ten Little
Niggers </em>(1945, US title: And Then There Were None) by the French
director René Clair, starring Walter Huston and Barry Fitzgerald, is
one of the most faithful and hilarious Christie adaptations. Cleverly
scripted by Dudley Nichols, it blended comedy with mystery in an
exquisite manner. During the war, the stage version enjoyed a
tremendous success at the St James Theatre in London, until Luftwaffe
brought an end to the performances by destroying part of the theatre.<strong>
      </strong></p>
      <p>According to Billy Wilder, Christie herself considered his <i>Witness
for the Prosecution</i> the best&nbsp;screen adaptation of her work. In
her autobiography Christie said that the opening night of the film was
"the only first night I have enjoyed." Wilder rewrote with Harry
Kurnitz the dialogue but did not change the clever plot with a surprise
ending. Charles Laughton&nbsp;played Sir Wilfred, a barrister, who
defends Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), an inventor, accused of murdering
a middle-aged widowed woman. Marlene Dietrich was his German wife
Christine Vole, an actress, eager to testify against her husband.
Wilfred has just recovered from a severe heart attack. The role of his
dominating nurse, Miss Plimsoll, was played by Laughton's wife, Elsa
Lanchester. In one scene she threatens to resign, if Wilfred doesn't go
to sleep. "Splendid," he replies. "Give her a month's pay and kick her
down the stairs." Dietrich's performance had everything &#8211; she sang,
kissed passionately Tyrone Power, said "I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes," and had a double role as a hard Cockney
woman and a coldly articulating German woman. She was very disappointed
when she did not even earn an Oscar nomination after showing her
emotional side to the whole world. </p>
      <p>In addition to the mysteries, Christie wrote her autobiography
(1977), and several plays, including <em>The Mousetrap</em>, which run
more than 30 years continuously in London, and had 8 862 performances
at the Ambassadors Theatre in London. The play was based on the short
story 'Three Blind Mice', and was produced in 1952 in Nottingham and
London. The original company at the Ambassadors Theatre included
Richard Attenborough as the detective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Christie's characters are usually well-to-do people. Often
their comfortable lifestyle is undermined by financial problems, which
lead to murder. Although her villains use very complicated plans, they
are not impossible, but are firmly grounded on the everyday reality: "Miss Lyall's hobby in life, as has been said, was the
study of human beings. Unlike most English people, she was capable of
speaking to strangers on sight instead of allowing four days to a week
to elapse before making the first cautious advance as is the customary
British habit."<font size="2"><b> </b></font><font size="2">(from
'Trinagle at Rhodes' in</font><i><font size="2"> Murder in the Mews</font></i><font size="2">, 1937) </font></p>
      <p>In many stories the reader is fooled to suspect an innocent
character, but most innovative Christie was when she revealed the
guilty party: it has been the narrator, a group of people, a serial
killer who tries to hide an obvious motive for his killing one of the
victims, and so forth. Christie's world view was conservative and
rational, but there is always a place for accidents: "'...Does it not
strike you that the<i> easiest</i> way of removing someone you want to
remove from your path is to take advantage of <i>accident</i>?
Accidents are happening all the time. And sometimes&nbsp;&#8211;
Hastings&nbsp;&#8211; they <i>can be helped to happen!</i>'"<b><font size="2">
      </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Dumb
Witness</font></i><font size="2">, 1937)</font>. </p>
      <p>Christie gives always a logical explanation for crimes, but
society is not blamed. Murder is not a sign of degeneration of
middle-class values. After the crime is solved, life continues happily.
Although Christie's writing career spanned over six decades, she was
conscious of social change without fixating on the period between the
two World Wars. "When I reread those first books," she said in 1966,
"I'm amazed at the number of<i> servants </i>drifting around. And
nobody is really doing any work, they're always having tea on the
lawn." However, she did not like editing her own text and was even
reluctant to change the spelling unless a word has actually been
misspelt. </p>
      <p>By 1955 Christie had become a limited company, Agatha Christie
Ltd, which was acquired in the late 1960s by Booker Books. It had
already acquired Ian Fleming. In 1967 Christie was appointed president
of the British Detection Club, and in 1971 she was made a Dame of the
British Empire. Christie died on January 12, 1976 in Wallingford,
Oxforshire. Mallowan died two years later, but he had married after
Christie's death an old family friend. With over one hundred novels and
over one hundred translations into foreign languages, Christie was by
the time of her death the best-selling English novelist of all time. As
Margery Allingham said: Christie has "entertained more people for more
hours at time that any other writer of her generation."<b><font size="2">
