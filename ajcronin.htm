<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Scottish novelist, an accomplished
storyteller, who practised as a doctor over a decade before devoting
himself entirely to writing. Cronin gained his fame initially with <i>Hatter's Castle</i>
(1931), the story of the megalomanic James Brodie, a Scottish hatmaker
and his foolish dreams of social acceptance. Cronin produced several
bestsellers drawing from his experiences as a doctor &#8211; his most famous
character was Dr Finlay Hyslop. Some of his works had religious themes,
like <i>The Keys of the Kingdom</i> (1942), which was also made into a film, starring Gregory Peck. Cronin continued to write until he was in his eightieth year. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the recollections of those who, like
myself, have ventured into descriptions of their early years, nothing
has bored me more than those long, tedious, and particularized listings
of the books the author has read and which led, in the end, to the
formation of a literary tastes that was demonstrably excellent. For
this reason I refrain from presenting a catalogue and state simply that
I read everything." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">A Song of Sixpence</font></i><font size="2">, 1964) </font></blockquote>
<p>Archibald Joseph Cronin was born in Cardross, Strathclyde, the only
child of Jessie (Montgomerie) Cronin and Patrick Cronin. His childhood
was shadowed by the death of his father and poverty; his mother tried
to struggle forward alone. After two years she returned to her parents'
home. His talent for writing was recognized early, and he won many
writing competition at Dumberton Academy, where he was sent at his
uncle's expense, and St. Aloysius' College. In 1914 he entered the
Glasgow University Medical School, graduating in 1919. During World War
I Cronin served as a surgeon in the Royal Navy, becoming a
sub-lieutenant. </p>
<p>After the war he worked as a ship's surgeon on a liner bound for
India, and then served in various hospitals. In 1921 Cronin married his
early love, Agnes Mary Gibson, whom he had met at Glasgow Medical
School. Cronin left Scotland and moved with his wife, who was also a
doctor, to Tregenny, a small mining town in South Wales, and then to
Tredegar, where they spent three years, and where their first child was
born. Cronin was awarded his D.Ph. in 1923 and the next year he was
appointed Medical Inspector of Mines. At this time, he continued his
studies, researching occupational diseases in the coal industry. These
experiences formed the basis of the novels <i>The Stars Look Down</i> (1935) and <i>The Citadel</i>
(1937), which made Cronin famous in the United States, and inspired the
director King Vidor's film version of the book. Robert Donat was
nominated for an Oscar for his performance in the film. It has been
claimed that Cronin's arguments for social justice and a better health
system contributed to the victory of the Labour Party in 1945. </p>
<p>In 1925 Cronin was awarded his M.D. by the University of Glasgow and
subsequently he started to practise in Wales and in London. Cronin's
heath broke down in 1930 and he sold his practice. Whilst convalescing
from gastric ulcers in the West Highlands of Scotland, he started to
write his 250,000-word novel, <i>Hatter's Castle</i>. Much of its
material derived from his frustration with the medical system and
bureaucracy in England, though the story tells of a hatter in a Small
Scottish town, who destroys himself and a number of others in his
struggle to regain his lost strature. Cronin once threw the manuscript
away, believing it would not be good. It was found by a local farmer,
digging a ditch which his father had dug without finishing the work.
Eventually Cronin completed his own effort. </p>
<p>The book was an immediate success in Britain and was filmed in 1941.
After its publication accusations were made, that Cronin had
plagiarized George Douglas's novel <i>The House With the Green Shutters </i>(1901). However, the book allowed Cronin to give up practicing medicine in favour of writing. <i>The Stars Look Down </i>was
a socially charged novel, which examined injustices in a North England
mining community. Carol Reed's film adaptation, starring Michael
Redgrave, was praised by the writer <a href="greene.htm">Graham Greene</a>:
"Dr Cronin's mining novel has produced a very good film &#8211; I doubt
whether in England we have ever produced a better." Generally it was
regarded as the first British film with social relevance. <i>Vigil in the Night</i>, first published in <i>Good Housekeeping </i>in
1939, was filmed by George Stevens in 1940, starring Carole Lombard,
Anne Shirley, and Brian Aherne. In this romantic melodrama Lombard
played a dedicated nurse in a provincial hospital in England, who
sacrifices herself for her sister, but then finds work in a large
hospital. Cronin's stories inspired also such directors as Victor
Saville (<i>The Green Years</i>), Philip Leacock (<i>The Spanish Gardener</i>), and Jack Cardiff (<i>Beyond This Place</i>). </p>
<p>In 1939 Cronin moved to the United States with his family. He wrote <i>The Keys of the Kingdom</i>,
a story of a Roman Catholic priest, Father Francis Chisholm, who spends
years as a missionary in China. Father Chisholm becomes familiar with
the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius, adopts a simple way
of life, and advocates ecumenical cooperation between all Christians.
His tolerance is viewed with suspicion within the institutional Church
by his superiors. David O. Selznick had bought the screen rights to the
novel in 1941 for $100,000, but he did not want to do the film with
Gregory Peck. However, Darryl F. Zanuck, production chief at 20th
Century-Fox, was convinced that Peck was right for the Father Chisholm
role. <a href="nunnally.htm">Nunnally Johnson</a> had written earlier
the screenplay and it was revised by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The film was
shot entirely on the Fox studio lot, but with its $3 million budget it
was one of the most expensive pictures of the year. </p>
<p>Critical reaction to the film was mixed. In the <i>New York Post</i>
Irene Thirer called the picture "a lengthy, highly dramatic,
entrancingly photographed production... Stahl had captured a delicate
spiritual quality, and at the same time managed to give the action
sequences a biting tang; also he has preserved the wit and subtlety of
the manuscript, with each and every performer expertly cast." Howard
Barnes of the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> saw that Mankiewicz and
Johnson did not "succeed in packing a rambling literary narrative into
the exigent outlines of a satisfactory film entertainment." Cronin
himself was satisfied with the result and praised both adaptation and
Peck's performance &#8211; the actor later said that he had been helped by a
Catholic missionary, Father O'Hara, who had lived eight years in China.
Peck was voted for an Oscar nomination for best actor. "I remember
particularly in one scene, where I had to preach in Chinese, how Father
O'Hara was persuaded to act out the scene for me. I hadn't been able to
catch the feeling of it somehow. I couldn't feel natural. So we asked
him to try it. And he did, walking through that crowd of Chinese
extras, ringing a little silver bell and talking to each one, in
Chinese, after first bowing with the greatest courtesy. He did it as he
must have done a thousand times in real life. Then I realized what I
had missed in the scene: that grave courtesy and respect for each
person as an individual." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Films of Gregory Peck</font></i><font size="2"> by John Griggs, 1984) </font></p>
<p>Catholic faith was also the central subject in <i>The Minstrel Boy</i>
(1975). The narrator is Alec, who follows through decades of disasters
and triumphs of his friend, Desmonde Fitzgerald, a young priest. Alec
becomes a doctor and a successful writer. Desmonde wins a singing
competition and his marvelous voice opens the doors to music for him,
and later to Hollywood films. But he also must solve his relationship
with the beautiful and wretched Claire, whom he has married, leaving
his career within the organization of the Church. Again Cronin's hero
must find his true calling in life. Desmonde rejects fame and glory,
and also the golf club at Bel Air and the Racquet Club at Palm Springs.
During his long walks on Malibu Beach he realizes the emptiness of his
life: "Few people use this stretch, far from the swimming beach and
bathing huts, and I encounter only the regulars: Charles Chaplin, too
enwrapped in his own genius to be conscious of anyone but himself, and
a tall, strongly built man who walks slowly, reading, but who
occasionally nods and smiles to me as we pass. These apart, one can
fond solitude, and here I walk, struggling with myself and with my own
unhappy thoughts." Eventually Desmonde goes to Madras to work amongst
the neglected and homeless children of the Untouchables. </p>
<p>Although English books were forbidden in Germany during World War
II, Cronin's works dealing with mining communities were in 1943 on
display in Dresden's bookstores for propaganda reasons. After the war
Cronin travelled with his family in Europe. In the autobiographical
book <span style="font-style: italic;">Adventures in Two Worlds</span>
(1952) Cronin returned to his experiences as a doctor in Scotland and
South Wales, and examined his religious beliefs in the last chapters.
Cronin tells how he rediscovered his Catholic background in the 1930s.
His father had been Catholic and his mother was from a strongly
Protestant family. At school Cronin grew away from religion &#8211; he had
been teased because of his Catholic faith, and he started to feel
disgust for bigotry. Cronin's own dream was brotherhood between people
and ecumenical understanding between different churches, not tearing
rivalry. This spirit of conciliation marked all his books dealing with
questions of faith. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Now he perceived how illusory his hopes
had been, how all his imaginings had been falsely based on a romantic
re-creation of the past. Had he actually expected, after thirty years,
to find Mary as on the day he had abandoned her, sweet with the
freshness of youth, tenderly passionate, still virginal? God knows he
would have wished it so. But the miracle had not occurred and now,
having heard the history of a woman who wept for him late and long, who
married, though not for love, lost an invalid husband, who suffered
hardships, ill-fortune, perhaps even poverty, yet sacrificed herself to
bring up her daughter to a worthy profession &#8211; knowing all this, he had
returned to reality, to the calm awareness that the Mary he would find
at Markinch would be a middle-aged woman, with work-worn hands and
tired, gentle eyes, bruised and defeated by the battle of live..."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Judas Tree</font></i><font size="2">, 1961) </font></blockquote>
<p>By 1958 the sales of Cronin's novels amounted to seven million in
the United States, but his Dickensian humanism and social realism made
him popular in the Soviet Union, too. <i>A Song of Sixpence</i> (1964) and<i> A Pocketful of Rye</i>
(1969) drew on his own experiences, and juxtaposed the early years of
poverty of the hero, Laurence Carroll, with the posh live he has at a
clinic in Switzerland. Many of Cronin's books were adapted for films or
television programs. The television series <i>Dr Finlay's Casebook</i>
(1959-66, new adaptation 1993) was based on his stories. In the 1960s
it was one of the most popular series on British television. For the
last 25 years of his life Cronin lived in Switzerland. He resided in
Lucerne near the actress Audrey Hepburn, and became the godfather of
her first son. His other friends included Laurence Olivier and Charles
Chaplin. Cronin died of bronchitis on January 9, 1981, in Glion,
Switzerland, a clinic near Montreux. </p>
