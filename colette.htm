<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist, whose career
spanned from her early 20s to her mid-70s. Colette's main themes were
joys and pains of love, and female sexuality in the male-dominated
world. All her works are more or less autobiographical but Colette
intentionally blurred the boundaries between fiction and fact. She
wrote over 50 novels and scores of short stories. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b><font size="2">"By means of an image we are often able to
hold on to our lost belongings. But it is the desperateness of losing
which picks the flowers of memory, binds the bouquet." </font></b><font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Mes Apprentissages</font></i><font size="2">, 1936) </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Sidonie-Cabrielle Colette was born in the Burgundian village
of Saint-Sauveur-en Puisaye. She was the daughter of a retired army
captain, Jules-Joseph Colette. He had lost a leg in the Italian
campaign and worked as a taxcollector with local political aspirations.
Colette's mother, Adele Eugenie Sidonie Landoy, known as 'Sidonie' or
'Sido', was an unconventional character, a down-to-earth personality,
devoted to her pets, books, and garden. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Colette spent a happy childhood in rural surrounding, the
scene of her many novels. While still a schoolgirl, she decided she
would be known by her surname, as the boys were. At the age of 20
Colette married the writer and music critic Henri Gauthier-Villars,
('Monsieur Willy'); he was 15 years her senior. Biographers have
labelled her first husband as a literary charlatan and degenerate, but
he saw at once that she was the better writer. Moreover, he gave her at
least one dose of gonorrhoea. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Encouraged to start a career as a writer Colette published in
short period four&nbsp;<em>Claudine</em>&nbsp;novels (1900-03) under
her husband's pen name Willy; he kept the copyright to these early
works. According to a famous story, he locked Colette in her room until
she had written enough pages. The series novels, which depicted
adventures of a teenage girl, was a huge success. It inspired all kinds
of side products &#8211; a musical stage play, Claudine uniform, Claudine
soap, cigars, and perfume. However, Colette's own cosmetics shop went
bankrupt. Tired of her husbands unfaithfulness, Colette broke free of
him in 1905. <br>
      </p>
      <p>After divorcing in 1906 Colette earned her living as a
music-hall performer at such places as La Chatte Amoureuse and L'Oiseau
de Nuit. On stage she bared one breast. A talk of the town, Colette
once mimed copulation in a sketch, which a riot at the Moulin Rouge.
Colette's protector and manager, a woman known as "Missy", was the
niece of Napoleon III, the Marquise de Belboeuf. At performances of <span style="font-style: italic;">Rêve d'Egypte</span> they bared their
breasts and kissed. Missy bought Colette a house in Brittany. She
committed suicide in 1944 &#8211; ruined and desperate. Among Colette's other
friends and probably lovers were Natalie Clifford Barney, an American
lesbian woman, and the Italian writer Gabriele d'Annunzzio. </p>
      <p>In 1912 Colette married Henri de Jouvenel des Ursins, the
editor of the newspaper <i>Le Matin</i>, for which she contributed
theatre chronicles and short stories. Henri was just as unfaithful as
Willy. Their daughter, Colette de Jouvenel, later told that she was
neglected by her parents &#8211; her mother never wanted a child and she
referred to her as "a rat". Colette's relationship with her young
stepson, Bertrand de Jouvenel, was a source of gossips. In the
novel&nbsp;<em>Chéri</em> (1920) she returned to the affair but
depicted it from a point of view of a sexually unexperienced young man.
Colette hired to prostitutes to take Bertrand's virginity, but when tey
failed, she seduced him. He later described his stepmother as
"demanding, voracious, expert and rewarding".<br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1910 Colette published <em>La Vagabonde</em>, a story
about an actress who rejects a man she loves in order to live in an
independent way. During World War I Colette converted her husband's St.
Malo estate into a hospital for the wounded. After the war she was made
a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour (1920). </p>
      <p>Colette had achieved prominence in the beginning of the
century but the 1920s brought her enormous fame. Her status in a
culture dominated by men was exceptional. She entered the world of
modern poetry and paintings, which centered around <a href="cocteau.htm">Jean Cocteau</a>, later her neighbor in Palais
Royale. By 1927 Colette was frequently acclaimed as France's greatest
woman writer. Especially Colette's insights into the behavior of women
in love gained a sympathetic response from the reading public. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'The great hat principle is that
when you meet a woman on the street and her hat allows you to see
whether she's a brunette, a blonde, or a redhead, the woman in question
is not wearing a chic hat. There! ... Notice I'm not saying anything,
I'll let you make up your own mind. Well?'" </b></font><font size="2">(from
'The Saleswoman' in </font><i><font size="2">Collected Stories</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Two central themes can be identified in Colette's mature
works: the nature and the mother-daughter bond. She wrote also with
great sensitivity about animals. <em>La Maison de Claudine</em> (1922)
mythologized her childhood, <em>La Naissance du Jour</em> (1928) and<em>
Sido</em> (1929) celebrated Colette's carefree rural childhood, and the
strength of her mother, whom the author rarely saw but wrote her many
letters. The letters were destroyed by her brother after Sidonie died.
In novels such as <i>La Vagabonde</i>, <em>Le Blé en herbe</em>
(1923),&nbsp;<em>La Seconde</em>&nbsp;(1929) and <em>La Chatte </em>(1933)
Colette explored the struggle between independent identity and
passionate love. Most of Colette's heroes and heroines, cocottes,
bisexuals and gigolos, came from the margins of society. Without
succumbing to sentimentality, Colette portrayed the moods and whims of
her characters with psychological insight and certain shamelessness. <i>Chéri</i>,
which is one of her most famous book, tells the story of the end of a
six year affair between an aging retired courtesan, Léa, and a pampered
young man, Chéri. Turning conventions upside-down it is Chéri who wears
silk pyjamas and Léa's pearls, he is the object of gaze. And in the end
Léa demonstrates all the survival skills which Colette associated with
femininity. The story continued in <i>The Last of Chéri </i>(1951),
which contrasts Léa's strength and Chéri's fragility, leading to his
suicide. </p>
      <p>Colette's attitude toward his art and toward herself
unpretentious. In the 1940s Colette portrayed her later years in <em>L'Étoile
Vesper</em> (1946) and <em>Le Fanal Bleu</em> (1949), which constantly
questioned the relationship between autobiography and fiction. <em>Gigi
      </em>(1945) was published when the author was 72; the novel was
made into a film in 1948. Vincente Minnelli directed a musicalized
version of the story in 1958. </p>
      
      <p>Colette worked had as a professional woman of letters. She was
made in the 1930s member of the Belgian Royal Academy and she was the
first woman to be admitted to the prestigious Goncourt Academy. In 1953
Colette became a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. She won also
many awards for her work. During the last 20 years of her life Colette
suffered from a crippling form of arthritis, which had been set off by
the fracture of a fibula in 1931. Her marriage with Henry de Jouvenal
ended in 1924. From 1935 she was married to Maurice Goudaket, whose
pearl business had been ruined during the Depression. After running out
of money he began selling second-hand washing machines and devices to
unblock lavatories. Colette supported him because as a Jew he did not
find work and had to hide when the Germans occupied France. His
infidelities did not trouble her. Colette died on August 3, 1954 in
Paris, where her fame was no less legandary than that of the writer <a href="gstein.htm">Gertrude Stein</a>
(1874-1946) or the singer Edith
Piaf (1915-1963). Her last residence was on the Rue de Beaujolais. She
had lived in the same building in 1927-28. Colette was accorded a state
funeral despite the
refusal of Catholic rites on the grounds that she had been divorced.
Her funeral was attended by thousands of mourners. </p>
