      <p>Swiss art historian and aesthetician, who attempted to
formulate an objective set of criteria for the classifications of art
history. Wölfflin's most famous works include <i>Renaissance und
Barock </i>(1888, Renaissance and Baroque) and <i>Die klassische Kunst</i>
(1898, Classic Art), and <i>Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriff</i>e
(1915, Principles of Art History). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Of all nations, Italy has given
the classic type its clearest impress; that is the glory of her
architecture as of her design. Even in the baroque she never went so
far in depriving the parts of their independence as Germany. We could
characterise the difference of imagination by a musical metaphor.
Italian church bells always hold to definite tone-figures: when German
bells ring it is merely a weft of harmonious sound."</b> </font><font size="2">(Wölflin in </font><i><font size="2">Principles of Art
History</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Heinrich Wölfflin was born in Winterthur, Switzerland, into a
wealthy and cultured family. His father, Eduard Wölfflin (1831-1903)
was a classical scholar, who helped found and organize the <i>Thesaurus
Linguae Latinae</i>, for which he prepared the <i>Archiv für
Lateinische Lexikographie und Grammatik</i> (15 vol., 1884-1909).
Wölfflin studied art history and philosophy at the University of Basel
from 1882 to 1886, where his teacher was the famous historian <a href="../../../burckha.htm">Jacob Burckhardt</a> (1818-1897), writer
of <i>The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy</i> (1860). He
spent two years in Italy, and published in 1888 his first major work, <i>Renaissance
und Barock</i>. It was not until the publication of this study that the
term "Baroque" was used neutrally in art history&nbsp;&#8211; earlier it had
been a synonym for eccentric odd, or bizarre. </p>
      <p>In Wölfflin's time baroque art was not considered respectable
outside Germany. Wölfflin applied the term to period which started
about 1530 and ended in the 1630s, when later it was used to describe
the style that followed Mannerism and lasted, though with profound
modifications, until well into the 18th century. Wölfflin made a clear
historical distinction between Renaissance and Baroque, which he
defined as "movement imported into mass." For Jacob Burckhardt, whose
thought deeply influenced Wölfflin, the style meant degeneration.
Prejudice against Baroque's artistic achievements continued almost
until the World War II. </p>
      <p>After studies in Berlin and Munich,<strong> </strong>Wölfflin
received his Ph.D. in 1888. He then worked for five years at the
University of Basel as a lecturer, before he was appointed Professor of
Art History in Basel. It is noteworthy that Wölfflin, who has been
labelled as a champion of "formal analysis", wrote in the very last
sentence of <i>Die klassische Kunst</i> (1899): "In no way do we want
to have pleaded for a formalistic appreciation of art. It certainly
needs the light to make the diamond sparkle." </p>
      <p>From 1901 to 1912&nbsp;Wölfflin was Professor of Art History
at the University of Berlin and then, suceeding Berthold Riehl,&nbsp;at
Munich until 1924. His most acclaimed work, <em>Kunstgeschichtliche
Grundbegriffe</em>,&nbsp;was written in&nbsp;the atmosphere of a
militaristic and patriotic hysteria that had engulfed Germany after the
outbreak of WWI. Disgusted by&nbsp;the war, Wölfflin donated large sums
to the Red Cross.&nbsp;At&nbsp;the end of his&nbsp;book,&nbsp;Wölfflin
spoke to his readers with the soothing words: "However different
national characters may be, the general human element which binds is
stronger than all that separates."&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Wölfflin pioneered the use of twin projectors (magic lanterns)
in teaching. As a lecturer Wölfflin was highly popular, with a few
exceptions.&nbsp;Walter Benjamin, who attended Wölfflin's lectures at
the University of Munich, complained that he "does not see the artwork,
he feels obliged to see it, demands that one see it, considers his
theory a moral act." E.H. Gombrich wrote in <em>Norm and Form</em>
(1966) that "I remember the high hopes with which I went to Berlin
University and the impression Wölfflin's personality made on me, the
tall Swiss with beautiful blue eyes and a firm and self-assured manner
of delivery that held the <em>auditorium maximum</em> spellbound.
I&nbsp;confess that the spell did not work on me for very
long."&nbsp;Wölfflin's&nbsp;fame drew a number of students to work on
doctoral theses on his direction. However, Max Raphael's&nbsp;work <em>Von
Monet zu Picasso</em> was rejected as a doctoral thesis by Wölfflin
because its subject was too modern and its argument did not focus
enough on the history of the style.</p>
      <p>After&nbsp;leaving Munich,&nbsp;where Brownshirts fought
Communists in the streets,&nbsp; Wölfflin continued his career
in&nbsp;peaceful<strong> </strong>Switzerland at the University of
Zürich. He was an editor of Jacob Burckhardt's work and published a
psychological study on the Renaissance art, <i>The Sense of Form</i>
(1931), in which he compared&nbsp;Italian and German art of the period.
Wölfflin died in Zürich, on July 19, 1945. He never married, but while
in Berlin he&nbsp;had been&nbsp;engaged to Ada Bruhn, the daughter of a
manufacturer of small motors.&nbsp;Bruhn broke the engagement and
married in 1913 the German architect Mies van der Rohe. </p>
      <p>Wölfflin once remarked that all pictures owe more to other
pictures than they do to the nature. His stylistic analysis was born as
a reaction to the anecdotal and biographical approach in art history,
partly deriving from <a href="../../../gvasari.htm">Vasari</a>'s <i>Vite
de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani</i>
(1550-68, The Lives of the Artists). When art history as a modern
academic discipline was taking its fist steps, Wölfflin wanted to
create for it a firm ground, "eine Naturgeschichte der Kunst", find
facts and laws, universal forms of representation. Thus in the preface
to the first German edition of <em>Principles of Art History</em>,
Wölfflin provocatively&nbsp;suggested creating&nbsp;art history
"without names", but after being mocked by this statement, he dropped
it from subsequent editions. </p>
      <p>Although&nbsp;the concept of style of a race occupied a
marginal role in Wölfflin's work, it&nbsp;could hardly fail to appeal
to the Nazis.<strong> </strong>National differences were for Wölfflin
constants determined by <em>Boden und Rasse</em> (soil and
race)&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp; much of his work reflected the&nbsp;belief
that forms of representation&nbsp;in Northern European art differed
radically from those in the Mediterranean art. Dürer was described as
an artist divided between North and South in<em> Die Kunst Albrecht
Dürers</em> (1905). Since 1929, along with a number of other eminent
university professors, Wölfflin acted as a patron of Alfred Rosenberg's
Kampfbund für Deutsche Kulture (Fighting Union for German Culture). Its
aim was to defend essentially German values, promote each and every
ethnic expression of German cultural life, and enlighten the German
people about connections between race, culture and science. Wölfflin
was also an adviser&nbsp;of&nbsp;the German Philosophical Society
(Deutsche Philosophische Gesellshacft),&nbsp; which united German
philosophers on the political right.</p>
      <p>Wölfflin first combined the "emphatic" notions of Adolf von
Hildebrand with his search for the "basic principles"&nbsp;
(Grundbegriffe)&nbsp;underlying the creation and appreciation of art,
governed by the requirements of a particular time and a particular
race. In the introduction of <i>Principles of Art History </i>Wölfflin
stated that each artist has his or her own personal style, but beyond
this there is also a national style, and finally a period style, which
rise and fall cyclically. "Not everything is possible at all times,"
Wölfflin wrote. "Vision itself has its history, and the revelation of
these visual strata must be regarded as the primary task of art
history." Gradually abandoning the empathy theory, Wölfflin began to
connect great changes in history of art to changes in ways of seeing
the world. </p>
      <p>To analyze the differences between the classic&nbsp;&#8211; roughly
the sixteenth century, Renaissance&nbsp;&#8211; style, and its opposite, the
Baroque style (the seventeenth century), Wölfflin used five pairs of
concepts. Paintings were analyzed without regard to their subject of
content. Moreover
, one of the basic elements of visual arts, color,
was&nbsp;subordinated to&nbsp;the other oppositions.&nbsp;</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2">1. <strong>Linear</strong> and&nbsp;</font><font size="2"><strong>Painterly<br>
        </strong>2. <strong>Plane</strong>&nbsp;and </font><font size="2"><strong>Recession<br>
        </strong>3. <strong>Closed</strong> and&nbsp;</font><font size="2"><strong>Open Form<br>
        </strong>4. <strong>Multiplicit</strong>y and </font><font size="2"><strong>Unity<br>
        </strong>5. <strong>Clearness </strong>and <strong>Unclearness</strong>&nbsp;</font></blockquote>
      <p>The first described the development from the linear to
painterly, the dissolution of firm, plastic form with strongly stressed
outlines into quivering and flickering, moving form. This pair came
close to Alois Riegl's contrast between haptic and optic. One of
Wölfflin's examples dealt with the&nbsp;difference between Dürer and
Rembrandt, whose paintings were dominated by lights and shadows,
whereas in Dürer's work the masses appeared with firm edges. Other four
categories were plane versus recession (the development from the vision
of the surface to the vision of depth), closed versus open form
(pictures were not adjusted to the line of the frame but suggested that
the representational area extended beyond the borders of the work),
multiplicity&nbsp;versus unity (change from the classic composition, in
which single parts have a certain independence, to a feeling of
unity),&nbsp;clearness&nbsp; versus&nbsp;unclearness (the contrast
between distinctness, in which light defines form in the detail, and an
attempt to evade clearness, to make the totality of the picture seem
unintentional). The last pair is closely&nbsp; related
to&nbsp;Wölfflin's first opposition. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What radically distinguishes
Rembrandt from D</b></font><b><font size="2">ürer is the vibration of
the picture as a whole, which persists even where they eye was not
intended to perceive the individual form-signs. Certainly it powerfully
supports the illusive effect if an independent activity in the building
up of the picture is assigned to the spectator, if the separate
brush-strokes coalesce only in the act of contemplation. But the
picture which comes to birth is fundamentally disparate from the
picture of the linear style. The presentment </font><i><font size="2">remains</font></i><font size="2"> indeterminate, and is not meant to settle into those lines
and planes which have a meaning for the tactile sense."</font></b><font size="2"> (Wölfflin in </font><i><font size="2">Principles of Art
History</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Wölfflin also applied his distinctions into sculpture and
architecture, and for example in architecture clearness means
representation in ultimate, enduring forms; baroque unclearness means
making the forms look like something changing, becoming. All these
opposed characteristics, except the striving for unity, are an
expression of the development from strictness to freedom. According to
Wölfflin, there is classic and baroque not only in more modern times,
but in the Middle Ages and in the Antique. </p>
      <p>The art historian <a href="../../../hauser.htm">Arnold Hauser</a>
has noted in <i>The Social History of Art</i> (vol. 2, 1962), that
Wölfflin's categories cannot be applied to such baroque artist as
Poussin and Claude Lorrain, who were neither "painterly" or "unclear".
He also criticizes Wölfflin's unhistorical approach, and his
indifference to sociological explanations behind the change of style.
"Wölfflin's categories of the baroque are, in fact, nothing but the
application of the concepts of impressionism to the art of the
seventeenth century..." <a href="panof.htm">Erwin Panofsky</a>'s
iconographical-iconological method, which focused on the subject matter
and meaning of works of art,&nbsp;became the antithesis of Wölfflin's
formalism.</p>
