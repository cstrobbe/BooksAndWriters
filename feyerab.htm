<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>





<p>Philosopher of science, a promiment advocate of epistemological anarchism, whose most famous work is <i>Against Method</i>
(1975). Feyeabend's exclamation, "Anything goes!" sloganized the
central point of the book &#8211; that there are no absolute truths and
science is an essentially anarchic enterprise. Richard Rorty has called
Feuerabend "the Norman Mailer of philosophy." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Successful research does not obey
general standards; it relies now on one trick, now on another; the
moves that advance it and the standards that define what counts as an
advance are not always known to the movers."</b> (from <i>Against Method</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>Paul Feyerabend was born into a middle-class Viennese family. His
father, also Paul, was a civil servant. He had participated in the
First World War as an officer in the merchant marine. "We were friends,
sort of," recalled Feyeabend in his autobiography, "but not very close;
I was much too self-centered and much to involved in my own affairs."
Years later after his father death, Feyerabend saw him in a dream and
asked forgiveness. <br>
</p>
      <p>Feyerabend's mother, Rosa Witz, was a seamstress; she
committed suicide in 1943. Thirteen years earlier she had tried to gas
herself. Her suicide note, filled with love and a desire for peace, she
addressed to husband. </p>

<p>Feyerabend was an excellent student at school. From the local public
library he borrowed Zane Grey, Edgar Wallace, Conan Doyle, Alexandre
Dumas, Marie Ebner Eschenbach, Jules Verne, Hedwig Courths-Mahler. At
high school he started to read Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, Shakespeare,
Ibsen, Plato, Descartes, Büchner and other dramatist and philosophers.
With his father, he built a telescope and became a regular observer for
the Swiss Institute of Solar Research, reporting on sunspots. Talented
in music, Feyerabend played the accordion, took violin lesson, sang in
a mixed choir under the direction of Leo Lehner, and took singing
lessons in a conservatory. </p>
<p>After finishing high school in 1942, he was drafted into the German
army &#8211; an inconvenience according to Feyerabend, not a moral problem,
because more than anything else he wanted to read. However, he also
considered joining the SS, mainly for aesthetic reasons: "an SS man
looked better and spoke better and walked better than ordinary
mortals." For his service on the eastern front Feyerabend was awarded
an Iron Cross, second class, in 1944. While in Poland in 1945, he was
wounded by machine-gun fire and paralyzed for a period of time. One
bullet got stuck in his spine. Throughout his life, Feyerabend endured
periodically great pain from his war wound, which made him impotent. As
a result of his injuries, Feyerabend used painkillers, but was also
interested in non-conventional medical treatment. </p>
<p>In 1945, Feyerabend entered the Weimar Music Academy, where he
studied theater science. He then moved to Vienna in 1946, where he
studied history, sociology, physics, mathematics, and astronomy at the
Institut für Österreichische Geschichtforschnung, part of the
University of Vienna. He also began to take singing lessons again and
was told that he was not a bass but a tenor. Critics compared him to
the Austrian-Czech tenor Leo Slezak (1873 - 1946). "I thought I was
better," said Feyerabend. </p>
<p>In the late 1940s, Feyerabend joined an informal philosophy group,
named the Kraft-Kreis after Viktor Kraft, a member of the old Vienna
Circle. Its meetings took place in Alpbach, a small mountain village
near Brixlegg in the Tyrol. The visiting speakers included Elizabet
Anscombe,<a href="gwright.htm"> Georg Henrik von Wright</a>, and Ludwig
Wittgenstein, who enjoyed the disrespectful attitude and impudent
questions of the students. During his stay in Alpbach, Feyerabend
became acquainted with Karl Popper, a Viennese-born British philosopher
of science and logic, famous for such works as <i>Logik der Forschung </i>(1937) and<i> </i><i>The Open Society and Its Enemies</i> (1945). Before they actually met, Feyerabend had skimmed through Popper's<i> Logik der Forschung</i>,
and had formed a mental image: "he would be tall, thin, serious, slow
and deliberate in his speaking. He was the very opposite."<font size="2"> </font>Popper
deeply influenced Feyerabend's thought, although he turned away from
his rational model of science in the 1960s. He considered Popper's
philosophy as internally inconsistent, in that Popper did not support
methodological pluralism, though he advocated theoretical pluralism.
Moreover, Feyerabend stressed the impossibility of comparing theories. </p>
<p>Feyerabend married his first wife, Edeltrud, a student of ethnology,
in 1948. "We married for practical reasons," Feyerabend explained, "in
the 1940s only married couples could travel together or book a single
room." Between 1949 and 1952, Feyerabend attended various courses and
summer schools in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. After receiving his Ph.D.
in philosophy with the dissertation <i>Zur Theorie der Basissätze </i>(1951),
Feyerabend moved to London, where he attended Popper's lectures and
seminars at the London School of Economics. Upon his return to Vienna
he translated Popper's <i>The Open Society and its Enemies</i>. For a
year, he worked as an assistant to Arthur Pap, and then, in 1955, he
went to Bristol, where he taught philosophy of science and the
philosophy of quantum mechanics. The course weas a disaster, confessed
Feyerabend in his autobiography. In 1956, Feyerabend married Mary
O'Neill, his former student &#8211; "a masterful performance on my part, full
of passion and despair, finally brought her around," Feyerabend said
later. However, soon after the honeymoon was over the marriage started
falling apart, and Mary moved to the second bedroom. </p>
<p>From 1958 to 1990, until his retirement, Feyerabend was a professor
at the University of California in Berkeley. On the wall of his
Berkeley home he hung giant King Kong poster. During these years he
became acquainted with Thomas Kuhn, the writer of <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>
(1960), who first coined the phrase "paradigm shift" Kuhn argued that
scientific progress is not gradual, but crisis in "normal science" is
sometimes resolved by a revolution that replaces the old paradigm with
a new one. The competing paradigms are incommensurable. Feyerabend went
even further and suggested that the new theories are not only
inconsistent with the old theories, but at the same time a
corresponding change takes place in the concepts and the so-called
scientific observation terms. There is, in other words, no permanent
neutral framework of meanings. All methodologies have their limits. "A
scientific revolution which shows the limitation of the theory and
which points out very plainly where it is wrong therefore gives back
empirical content to the theory," Feyerabend wrote in a letter to Kuhn.
"Conclusion: better live in permanent revolution than in the state of
normalcy." </p>
<p>Most of his time in the late 1960s, Feyerabend divided between
Berkeley, London, and Berlin. An internationally highly sought
lecturer, Feyerabend also taught in Auckland, Hamburg, Kassel,
Brighton, and Yale. According to a story, he once ended his lecture at
the London School of Economics by jumping out the window and riding off
on his motorbike. In London, his close friends included Imre Lakatos.
At Popper's house, Lakatos, Feyerabend and other philosophers of
science, who had criticized him, were known as "the Wasps' Nest Club." </p>
      <p><i>Against Method</i>, which first appeared in volume 4 of the <i>Minnesota Studies</i><i>, </i>was
originally meant to be Feyerabend's part of his common enterprise with
Lakatos. However, his colleague died suddenly in 1974, before he could
write his planned reply to the work. Where Marx sought to liberate the
working class from the tyranny of capital, Feyeabend wanted to liberate
scientists from the stultifying effect of "the Laws of Reason."
Feyerabend did not contend, that there is no such thing reason, but the
complexity, vagaries and unpredictableness of human
activity defy the naive and simple-minded rules of rationality. Many of
the arguments had been presented in Feyerabend's earlier papers, and
even as a student Feyerabend had mocked the theories and abstract
concepts of philosophers. Reviewers compared his attitude to that of <a href="kkraus.htm">Karl Kraus</a>. </p>

<p>From 1980 to 1990, Feyeabed taught during the summers at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zürich. <i>Farewell to Reason</i>
(1987), a collection of essays, dealt with such issues as 'Reason,
Xenophanes and the Homeric Gods,' 'Progress in Philosophy, the Sciences
and the Arts,' 'Galileo and the Tyranny of Truth.' Feyeabend stressed
that "scientists in general may profit from a study of unscientific
methods and points of view and Western civilization as a whole can
learn from the beliefs, habits, institutions of 'primitive' people." <br>
 </p>
<p>In 1989, Feyerabend married Grazia Borrini; they had met already in
1983 at Berkeley, where she had attended his seminar. A brilliant
student of physics, she had given up her promising career in natural
sciences after having seen human misery in India, and devoted herself
to conservation and development. Upon his retirement, Feyerabend lead a
withdrawn life in Switzerland. During this period, Feyerabend wrote his
autobiography, <i>Killing Time</i>, and worked on a book entitled <i>The Conquest of Abundance</i>.
It was intended to show "how specialists and common people reduce the
abundance that surrounds and confuses them, and the consequences of
their actions." Feyerabend did not finish the book. A couple of weeks
after writing the last words of his autobiography, a tumor began to
affect the pain center in his brain.&nbsp; Having been accustomed to painkillers, he needed extremely high doses of morphine.  Feyerabend died on February 11, 1994, in Geneva.<br>
 </p>
<p>During his active academic career, Feyerabend's unconventionality,
independence and provocative writings turned him into a legendary
figure. It was known that he did not always prepare his lecture or he
could cancel it at the last minute, because he had something better to
do. It was also (wrongly) claimed, that he had eleven children.
Although Feyerabend's agitative style did not even scratch the surface
of academic etiquette, his anti-foundational mode of thought, arguments
against rationality, and epistemological anarchism stimulated the
postmodernist deconstruction of tradition. On the other hand, before
becoming pope Cardinal Ratzinger mentioned in a talk Feyerabend in
support of his views. </p>
