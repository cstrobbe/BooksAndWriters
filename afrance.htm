<P>Writer, critic, one of the major figures of French literature in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Anatole France was awarded the Nobel Prize for 
Literature in 1921. In the 1920 France's writings were put on 
the Index of Forbidden Books of the Roman Catholic Church. His skepticism appears already in his early 
works, but later the hostility toward bourgeois values led him to 
support French Communist Party.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread."</B> (from <I>The Red Lily</I>, 1894) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Anatole France was born Jacques Anatole Fran&ccedil;ois Thibault in Paris. At early age France acquired a love for books and 
reading. His father was a bookseller, 
who called his shop the 'Librarie de France' – from this the future writer
took his surname. France was educated at the Coll&eacute;ge Stanislaus, where he was a mediocre student. During this period France adopted his lifelong anti-clericalism and later constantly mocked the church and religious doctrines in his books. On the whole France's early years, which he depicted in <I>My Friend's Book </I>(1885), were happy. After failing his baccalaureate examination several times, France finally passed it at the age of twenty. In the 1860s he was for a time an assistant to his father, then he was a cataloguer and publisher's assistant at Bacheline-Deflorenne and at Lemerre. He also worked as a teacher.</P>

<P>When his father retired, France took a series of jobs as an editorial
assistant. He became member of the Parnassian group of poets, Gautier,
Catulle, Mendes and others, and built himself a high reputation in the literature circles. During the Franco-Prussian War, France served
briefly in the army, and witnessed the bloodbath at the Paris
Commune in 1871. </P>

<P>In 1875 the newspaper <I>Le Temps</I> commissioned France to write
a series of critical articles on contemporary writers. The next year he started
his weekly column, which were published until 1892 and collected in four volumes under the title <EM>La vie litt&eacute;raire</EM>. 
In 1876 France was appointed with the help of the leading Parnassian poet Leconte de Lisle (1818-1894) an assistant librarian for the French Senate, a post he held fourteen years. Leconte de Lisle encouraged France to publish his first collection of poems, <EM>Les Po&egrave;mes dor&eacute;s</EM> (1873). France's first collection of stories appeared in 1879.</P>

<P>As a novelist France made his breakthrough with <I>The Crime
of Sylvestre Bonnard</I> (1881). Like his other works, it looked back to the 18th century as a golden age. Its protagonist, skeptical old scholar Sylvester Bonnard, was the first of series of fictional characters, who embody France's own personality. The novel was praised for its elegant prose and irony and won the author a prize from the French Academy.</P>

<P>In 1877 France married Val&eacute;rie Gu&eacute;rin de Sauville. The marriage ended in divorce in 1893, several years after France's liaison with Mme Arman de Caillavet (Leontine Lippmann), a patron of arts and the great love of the author. This period inspired France's Christian fantasy about beauty and wisdom, THA&Iuml;S (1890), closely related to <A href="../../../flaubert.htm">Gustave Flaubert</A>'s <I>The Temptation of St. Anthony</I>. <EM>Le Lys rouge</EM> (1894), a <I>roman 
&agrave; clef</I> dealing with the relationship, gained a huge success. </P>

<P>Between the years 1897 and 1901 France wrote four novels under the title
<I>Contemporary History</I>, a fictional account of Belle Epoque. The
first volume introduced an other important France persona, monsieur Bergeret, a provisional schoolteacher. <I>The Queen P&eacute;dauque</I>
(1893) introduced Jerome Coignard, whom France used as his
vehicle for moral ponderings and advocate for tolerance in <I>The Opinions of Mr. Jerome Coignard</I> (1893). During the 1890s and early 1900s France argued for social reforms and attacked the shortcomings of contemporary society and the church. In 1888 he was appointed literary critic of the importrant newspaper <I>Le Temps</I>. </P>
<P>France participated in the famous Dreyfus case with other writers, in front of them <A href="../../../ezola.htm">&Eacute;mile Zola</A> 
with his famous article <I>J'Accuse</I> (1898). France discussed the affair
in the fourth volume of <I>Contemporary History</I>, entitled <I>
Monsieur Bergeret in Paris</I> (1901). He was the first to sign 
&Eacute;mile Zola's manifesto, condemning the false indictment for treason
of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish army captain, which had been made to
protect high army officials from the scandal of exposed corruption. After the Dreyfus case in the mid-1890s France's ironic views of contemporary society became even more poignant and disillusioned.</P>

<P>France resigned his library job at the Senate in 1890, and was 
elected to the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise in 1896. He presided at the 
salon of Armand de Caillavet until her death in 1910. The last fifteen
years of France's life were shadowed by personal difficulties, some of
which he created himself. His daughter Suzanne died in 1917, his
mistress Mme Arman, whom he started to deceive with other women as early
as 1904, became seriously ill and died in 1910. He deceived his
housekeeper, Emma Laprevotte, whom he later married, and an American
woman whom he had deserted, killed herself in 1911. </P>


<P>Among Frace's major later works is <I>Penquin Island</I> (1908), in which
humanity's evolutionary course and the history of France is allegorized satirically through the transformation of penguins into humans – after the animals have been baptized in error by the nearsighted Abbot Mael. The two-volume biography, <I>The Life of Joan of Arc</I> (1908), was poorly received - Catholics criticized its realistic portrayal of Joan and historians had much to say about its historical accuracy. <I>The Gods Are Athirst</I> (1912) was a historical novel about the French Revolution. In <I>The Revolt of Angels</I> (1914) France used the familiar theme of religious conflict from Milton's <I>Paradise Lost</I>. The revolt of fallen angels breaks out again, when a guardian angel, Arcade, is converted to free thought by Lucretius' summary of Epicurean philosophy <I>De rerum natura</I>. The work, a strong protest against violence and tyranny, was the author's last interesting novel. </P>

<P>France died on October 12, 1924, in Tours, where he had moved ten
years earlier. His funeral was attended by the highest ranking members of 
the French government. The poet Paul Val&eacute;ry succeeded to Anatole France's chair and delivered an unconventional address upon his predecessor. In stead of the usual complimentary obituary, he made an attack: "He perfected the art of brushing lightly over the most serious ideas and problems. Nothing in his books gives the least difficulty unless it be the wonder itself of encountering none." </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"Anatole France was essentially a rationalist: he did not deny the incongruities and incoherences of experience, but he attempted to write about them, at least, in a simple, logical and harmonious style. Paul Val&eacute;ry has set himself, on the contrary, the task of reproducing by his very language all the complexities and confusions of our interacting sensations and ideas. The phenomena with which France usually deals are the events of life as it is lived in the world; with Val&eacute;ry the object of interest is the iolated or ideal human mind, brooding on its own contradictions or admiring its own flights." </B>(Edmund Wilson in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Axel's Castle</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1931) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
