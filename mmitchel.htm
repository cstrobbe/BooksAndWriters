      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American author of the
novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> Gone With the Wind</span>
(1936), story about the Civil War and Reconstruction, as seen from the
Southern point of view. The book was adapted into a highly
popular film in 1939, starring Clark Gable as Rhett Butler and Vivien
Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara. At the novel's opening in 1861, Scarlett is a
young girl. During the story, she experiences the destruction of the
Old South, as well as three marriages and motherhood. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful,
but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton
twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features
of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones
of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of
chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel,
starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends.
Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling
oblique line in her magnolia-white skin &#8211; that skin so prized by
Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens
against hot Georgia sun."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Gone with
the Wind</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Margaret Mitchell was born in Atlanta. Her mother, Maybelle
Mitchell, was a suffragist and father, Eugene Mitchell, a prominent
lawyer and president of the Atlanta Historical Society. Mitchell grew
up listening to stories about old Atlanta, and the battles the
Confederate Army had fought there during the American Civil War. At the
age of fifteen, she wrote in her journal: "If I were a boy, I would try
for West Point, if I could make it, or well I'd be a prize fighter &#8211;
anything for the thrills." Mitchell graduated from the local Washington
Seminary and started to study medicine at Smith College in 1918. She
had adopted her mother's feminist leanings, which clashed with her
father's conservatism &#8211; in the new surroundings, she lived fully the
Jazz age. She wrote in an article, 'Dancers Now Drown Out Even the
Cowbell', published in the <i>Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine</i>: "In
vain, the leader the jazz band may burst blood vessels in his efforts
to make himself heard above the din of the "Double Shuffle" and the
"Fandango Stamp," the newest dances introduced to Atlanta's younger
set. Formerly we had a vast respect for the amount of noise a jazz band
could produce. Now we see it is utterly eclipsed." After performing an
Apache dance in a hotel in 1921, she was blackballed from the Junior
League. </p>
      <p>When Mitchell's mother died in 1919, she returned to home to
keep house for her father and brother. In 1922, she married Berrien
"Red" Upshaw . The disastrous marriage was climaxed by spousal rape and
was annulled 1924. Mitchell launched her career as a journalist under
the name Peggy Mitchell, writing articles, interviews, sketches, and
book reviews for the Atlanta <i>Journal.</i> Four years later, she
resigned after an ankle injury. Her second husband, John Robert Marsh,
an advertising manager, encouraged Mitchell in her writing aspirations.
From 1926 to 1929, she wrote <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. The outcome, a
thousand page novel, was published by the Macmillan Publishing Company
in 1936. The retail price of the book was $3.00. </p>
      <p>Mitchell's work broke sales records, its scope and vision was
compared with <a href="ltolstoi.htm">Tolstoy</a>'s <i>War and Peace</i>,
the <i>New Yorker </i>praised it, and the poet and critic John Crowe
Ransom admired "the architectural persistence behind the big work", but
criticized it as overly Southern, particularly in its treatment of
Reconstruction. Malcolm Cowley's disdain in his review originated
partly from the view, that Mitchell had written a bestseller. John
Peale Bishop dismissed it as merely "one more of those 1000 page
novels, competent but neither very good nor very sound." Not
surprisingly, <i>Gone with the Wind</i> was awarded the Pulitzer Prize
in 1937. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Death and taxes and childbirth!
There's never any convenient time for any of them."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Gone with the Wind</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>The protagonist of the novel is Scarlett O'Hara, a spoilt
Southern belle, who loves Ashley Wilkes. However, the reader is soon
assured that the most important man in her life will be the strong and
shrewd Rhett Butler, in many respects a typical Victorian hero. Ashley
marries Melanie Hamilton and Scarlett marries Melanie's brother
Charles, but she is soon widowed. Surviving the siege and burning of
Atlanta, Scarlett makes her way back through the lines to the O'Hara
plantation. Then she marries Frank Kennedy, her sister's fiancé, to
save Tara, her home. Frank is also killed, and Scarlett finally marries
Rhett, who has made a fortune from the war. They have a daughter,
Eugenia Victoria "Bonnie Blue" Butler, who dies tragically in an
accident. Always on the move, Rhett decides to leave her, and when she
asks, "what shall I do," he answers with the famous words, "My dear, I
don't give a damn." </p>
      <p>Until the publication of <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, <a href="lwallace.htm">Lew Wallace</a>'s<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ben-Hur</span> (1880) had been the best-selling American novel. Although the <i></i>work brought Mitchell fame and
a tremendous fortune, it seems to have brought little joy. Chased by
the press and public, the author and her husband lived modestly and
traveled rarely. Also questions about the book's literary status and
racism, historical view and depiction of the Klu Klux Klan, which had
much similarities with D.W. Griffith's film <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>
(1915), led to critical neglect, which continued well in the 1960s.
Griffith's film was based on the Reverend Thomas Dixon's racist play;
the author was a great admirer of Mitchell and wanted to write a study
of her novel. In Atlanta, the Klan kept a high profile and had it
national headquarters in the 1920s on the same street, where Mitchell
lived.</p>
      <p>Mitchell sold the film rights to the producer David O.
Selznick for $50.000, and later received another $50.000. The old sets of the 1925 <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span>, starring Ramon Novarro, were burned while shooting the Atlanta sequence. The film
premiered on December 15, 1939. Mitchell did not take any part in the
motion picture adaptation, but attended the premiere in Atlanta,
overcoming her shyness. The film won ten Academy Awards, among them
best picture. However, all reviews were not positive. Otis Ferguson
wrote in the <i>New Republic</i> (April 22, 1940): "It moves, just as
I suspected it would, and it is in color, just as I heard it was, and
the Civil War gets very civil indeed and there is a wonderful bonfire
and there are also young love and balls and plantations and practically
everything... They threw in many good things, and everything else but a
towel, and they got them in line and added them all up to one of the
world's imposing cancellations." In England, the film and the book were
highly popular during World War II &#8211; perhaps partly because of the
theme of survival and reconstruction. After the war, the film conquered
the rest of the Europe, giving many women comfort and strength in their
everyday problems. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'I'll think of it all to-morrow,
at Tara. I can stand it then. To-morrow, I'll think of some way to get
him back. After all, to-morrow is another day.'" </b>(Scarlett in </font><i><font size="2">Gone with the Wind</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
      <p>During World War, II Mitchell was a volunteer selling war
bonds and volunteer for the American Red Cross. She was named honorary
citizen of Vimoutiers, France, in 1949, for helping the city obtain
American aid after WW II. Mitchell died in Atlanta on August 16, 1949 &#8211;
she was accidentally struck by a speeding car while crossing Peachtree
Street. Authorized sequel for <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, entitled <i>Scarlett</i>
and written by Alexandra Ripley, appeared in 1992. In the story
Scarlett journeys to Ireland with her children and meets again Rhett
Butler. <span style="font-style: italic;">Lost Laysen</span>, a lost
novella by Mitchell, written when she was 16, and given to her close
friend, was published in 1995. The romantic story was set on a South
Pacific island. </p>
