<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American science fiction writer,
whose
imaginative treatment of clichés of the genre &#8211; time travel, the
existence of alternative worlds &#8211; has influenced deeply popular
culture.
For most of his career, Dick lived in poverty, although he was prolific
and wrote 112 short stories and over 30 novels. Things got even worse
when
he ruined his health by heavy use of psychedelics. In March 1974 the
writer claimed
to have been contacted by an extraterrestrial force, a "beam of pink
light" theoretically originating from a satellite he came to call
VALIS: Vast Active Living Intelligence System. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He would die, and presently they
would realize their mistake. Perhaps at some other time, when there was
no war, men might not act this way, hurrying an individual to his death
because they were afraid. Everyone was frightened, everyone was willing
to sacrifice the individual because of the group fear."</b> (from the
short story </font><font size="2">'Imposter'</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Philip K. Dick was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of
Joseph Edgar Dick, a Federal Government employee, and Dorothy Kindred.
His twin sister Jane died just a few weeks after the birth, and his
parents divorced when he was four. The family moved to California when
he was young. He attended Berkeley High School and studied from 1945 to
1946 at the University of California at Berkeley. He operated a record
store and worked as a disk jockey for the KSMO radio station. During
these years Dick began to write science fiction stories and sold his
first tale in 1952 to <i>Planet Stories</i>. One of Dick's tales from
this period, 'Paycheck', was filmed in 2003 by John Woo, starring Ben
Affleck and Uma Thurman. Dick also composed over half-a-dozen
mainstream novels without much success. Frustrated by this inattention
he turned to science fiction, a genre which he found ideal for his
philosophical speculations. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Hendricks glanced down. The boy
was strange, saying very little. Withdrawn. But that was the way they
were, the children who had survived. Quiet. Stoic. A strange kind of
fatalism gripped them. Nothing came as a surprise. They accepted
anything that came along. There was no longer any normal, any natural
course of things, moral or physical, for them to expect. Custom, habit,
all the determining forces of learning were gone; only brute experience
remained." </b>(from the short story </font><font size="2">'Second
Variety'</font><font size="2">, 1953) </font></blockquote>
<p>At the age of 27, Dick finally found a publisher. Between the
years 1955 and 1970 he wrote an average of two paperback novels a year
and more than one hundred short stories in such magazines as <i>Galaxy</i>,
<i>Amazing</i>, <i>Fantasy</i> and <i>Science Fiction</i>, and <i>Worlds
of If</i>. Among his publishers was Ace Books. However, he also had
time to romantic affairs, he read books from the Bhagavad-Gita to <a href="cjung.htm">Carl Jung</a>, and spent time in the company of
beatniks and hippies. Dick's first published novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">Solar Lottery</span> (1955). It was set on
an Earth of the twenty-third century where democracy is replaced by
lottery which decides people's place in society. Eventually lottery is
revealed as a front for secret rulers of the world. With his second
wife, Kleo, he moved to west Marin , where he met Anne Rubenstein, the
widow of a San Francisco poet. They married in 1959 and divorced five
years later. However, during this period Dick wrote some of his best
novels. "He was quite different with each person," Anne R. Dick
recalled in an interview. "He had this enormous gift of empathy, and he
used it to woo and please and control." </p>
<p>As a writer Dick gained first recognition with <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man in the High Castle</span> (1962),
an alternate universe story and a novel within the novel, where Germany
and Japan have won the World War II and jointly occupy the United
States. A disillusioned writer, Hawthorne Abendse, has produced a novel
speculating what would happen if the Allies had <i>won</i> the war.
I-Ching exists in this reality, too, and reveals that it is not the
real world. Mr Tagomi of the Japanese Trade Mission, consults his I
Ching constantly, and is transported into our reality. <span style="font-style: italic;">Martian Time-Slip</span> (1964) was set in
forgotten Mars, where scarce water supplies are controlled by the head
of the plumbers' union. The Bleekmen are hated aliens, with whom the
colonists try to live alongside. An autistic Martian boy, Manfered
Steiner, controls the future, he can "make it come out the worst
possible way because that's what seems natural to him, that's how he
sees reality." </p>
<p> The characters of <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</span> (1965) are at the mercy of a
cruel demiurge. A man returns from a distant galaxy with a new drug,
Chew-Z, that allows people to slip into vast virtual-reality worlds of
their own devising. But there are side effects with the drug: Paul
Eldritch can enter into everyone's private reality. Also another drug,
Can-D, is in in wide use, it gives dreams of world where all is
permitted. At the end of the novel Dick made his own choice: "I saw
enough in the future not to ever give up, even if I'm the only one who
doesn't succumb, who's still keeping the old way alive, the pre-Palmer
Eldritch way. It's nothing more than faith in powers implanted in me
from the start which I can &#8211; in the end &#8211; draw on and beat him with." <span style="font-style: italic;">Ubik</span> (1969) the dead come back to
invade the realities of the living. <span style="font-style: italic;">Flow
My Tears, The Policeman Said</span> (1974) was also adapted into stage
by Linda Hartinian in New York and won the John W. Campbell Memorial
Award. <span style="font-style: italic;">A Scanner Darkly</span>
(1977) followed the decline of a high-tech undercover agent, Bob
Arctor, and drew a disillusioned picture of a future drug culture. At
the centre of the story is a highly volatile drug called Substance D &#8211;
or Death. </p>
<p>Most of Dick's fiction was set in California. He draw ideas
from Buddhism, Kabbalism, Gnosticism, Taoism, used the typical science
fiction elements with robots, space ships, ESP, and extraterrestrials.
Often the viewpoint switches between several characters. In his article
'Man, Android and Machine' Dick wrote about sly and cruel creatures
among us, whose "handshake is the grip of death, and their smile has
the coldness of the grave." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Science Fiction at Large</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by
Peter Nicholls, 1976) </font>With his paranoid view of reality, Dick's
work has revealed the threads behind technological inventions. </p>
<p>Dick's fear of political or social repression was not mere
illusion: the writer was under scrutiny by the FBI and Air Force
intelligence for his connection to the American Communist party and his
opposition to the Vietnam War. Several of his novels dealt with theme
of alternate world and manipulation of the reality. In the late 1960s
and especially 1970s the drug aspect and theology began to dominate the
narration. After a break-in at his house in San Rafael, Dick went to
Vancouver for a period. Dick began to believe in 1974 that inside him
was a part a reborn ancient personage, Simon Magus, the Gnostic. Dick
was married five times and had three children. His papers are collected
at the California State University in Fullerton. Dick's posthumous
reputation has not shown signs of decline. </p>
<p>The traumatic encounter with the 'beam of pink light', led
Dick to write a diary known as the 'Exegesis'. He continued his
self-examination in the trilogy <span style="font-style: italic;">Valis</span>
(1981), an analysis of a man who is mad and another who is not, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Divine Invasion</span> (1981), and<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</span>
(1982). Dick died of a stroke on March 2, 1982, just a few months
before the film <i>Blade Runner</i>, based on his <span style="font-style: italic;">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</span>
(1968), was released. The blockbuster film <i>Total Recal</i> from
1990 was based on the story 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale' and
also led to a cable TV series. In the story many humans have left the
planet. Rick Deckard hunts androids who have been imported to the
planet from Mars. His chief wish to be able to afford to purchase and
care for an artificial sheep. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"For Dick, the real question was
not whether mankind's creations would turn against us. He seems to have
believed that the existence of nuclear weapons proved they already had.
Most of his novels take place in a world rising out of the ashes of
nuclear war. His main fascination was the likelihood that technology
would lead to the disappearance of the very frontier between what
mankind creates and what mankind is."</b> (</font><font size="2">Richard
Bernstein in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">November 3, 1991) </font></blockquote>
<p><i>Blade Runner</i> was directed by Ridley Scott, starring
Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauger, and Daryl Hannah. Scott had achieved fame
with <i>Alien </i>(1979) and stated before his new project that he
had not read the novel. Dick was afraid that the director would make a
movie with the spirit of "eat lead, robot!" in which he was wrong in
this particular case. Dick did not expect much from Hollywood and told
in an interview in 1980: "You would have to kill me and prop me up in
the seat of my car with a smile printed on my face to get me to go near
Hollywood." <i>Blade Runner </i>was set in Los Angeles AD 2019, where
a licenced-to-kill policeman tracks down and destroys a group of
intelligent robots who have returned to Earth. But is the police also
an android? The film did not do well at the box office, and the studio
insisted on a happy ending. Directors original cut, which different
ending and without much voice-over narration, was released in 1991.
Dick's novel covers one "marathon" day in the life of Rick Deckard. The
second plot, removed from the film, deals with John Isidore, who seeks
a messiah called Mercer and falls in love with an outlaw android. In
wilderness with Mercer Deckard learns to love an electronic toad, but
Isidore learns that Mercer is a fraud.<b> </b></p>
<p><i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> was Philip K.
Dick's reworking of his at that time unpublished novel, <i>We Can
Built You </i>(1972), about a schizophrenic woman who builds androids
because they, like herself, cannot feel love or empathy... Patricia
Warrick observed that the novel "evolved from his insight that a man
takes on the very qualities of the evil he fears and hates when he goes
to war with his enemy to destroy the evil. When man fights and kills,
he destroys himself spiritually."'<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Novels into Film</font></i><font size="2"> by John C. Tibbets and James M. Welsh, 1999)</font> Other
film adaptations include <i>Confessions d'un Barjo</i> (1993), dir. by
Jerome Bolvin, <i>Screamers </i>(1995), directed by by Chriastian
Duduay, based on the short story 'Second Variety', <i>Impostor</i>
(2002), dir. by Gary Fleder, starring Gary Sinise, Madeleine Stowe,
Vincent D'onofrio, and <i>Minority Report</i> (2002), directed by
Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise. Spielberg's intelligent
adaptation of Dick's short story with the same title from 1956 dealt
with the author's favorite themes &#8211; free will and the nature of
reality. Cruise plays John Anderton, a member of an élite squad known
as Pre-Crime, which tries to prevent murders by arresting people before
they commit the crime. Anderton lives a double-life and due his family
tragedy he is soon hunted as a potential murderer. </p>
