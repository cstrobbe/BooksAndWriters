<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American writer, an eccentric 
whose Paris home was a salon for the Cubist and experimental artist
and writers, among them Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque,


&nbsp;Juan Gris, <a href="fsfitzg.htm">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="shanders.htm">Sherwood Anderson</a> and <a href="hemingwa.htm">Ernest
Hemingway</a>.
Stein, a brilliant conversationalist, became a legend with her Roman
senator haircut and verbal facility. Against all odds, she survived the
persecution of sexual minorities and Jews during the German occupation
of France in World War II.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Most of us balk at her soporific
rigmaroles, her echolaliac incantations, her half-witted-sounding
catalogues on numbers; most of us read her less and less. Yet,
remembering especially her early work, we are still always aware of her
presence in the background of contemporary literature &#8211; and we picture
her as the great pyramidal Buddha of Jo Davidson's statue of her,
eternally and placidly ruminating the gradual developments of the
process of being, registering the vibrations of a psychological country
like some august human seismograph whose charts we haven't the training
to read." </b>(Edmund Wilson in <i>Axel's Castle</i>, 1931) </font></blockquote>
<p>Gertrude Stein was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, of educated
German-Jewish immigrants. Her father, Daniel Stein, was a
traction-company executive, who had become wealthy through his
investments in street railroads and real estate. His business took the
family for four years to Vienna and Paris, when Stein was a child. In
1879 the family returned to America. With her parents, she made
subsequently several cultural trips to Europe. After the death of her
mother and father, Stein and two of her siblings lived with her
mother's family in Baltimore. </p>
<p>In 1893 Stein entered Harvard Annex (now Radcliffe College) in
Cambridge. She studied psychology under William James (1842-1910) and
experimented with automatic writing under his direction. James also
visited Stein in Paris in 1908. After studies at Johns Hopkins medical
school, where she specialized in brain anatomy, Gertrude Stein moved to
Paris, without taking the M.D. degree. She lived there from 1903 with
her brother Leo, and from 1914 with her life companion, <a href="toklas.htm">Alice B. Toklas</a>,
an accomplished cook for the salon's guests at the 27 Rue de Fleurus
flat, near Luxembourg Gardens. Her salon attracted intellectuals and
artists to discuss new ideas in art and politics. In the atmosphere of
creative energy, Stein wanted to produce modern literary version of the
new art<i></i>. In addition, she and her brother started to collect
early works by such contemporary painters as Matisse and Picasso, who
later described her as his only woman friend. Picasso met her first
time at an informal art gallery established by Clovis Sagot, a former
clown. He also painted a portrait of Stein in a brownish-gray
monochrome. "Masculine, in her voice, in all her walk," described
Picasso's lover Fernande Bellevallée her. "Fat, short, massive,
beautiful head, strong, with noble features, accentuated regular,
intelligent eyes." </p>
<p>Stein's first novel, Q.E.D. (1903), remained unpublished until after her death<font face="Symbol">-</font>perhaps because of its intimate, lesbian nature. As a writer Stein made her debut with <em>Three Lives</em>
(1909), clearly influenced by the Jameses, novelist Henry and
psychologist William. Stein's book was based on a reworking of a late
Flaubert text called <i>Trois Contes.</i> Stein also tried to connect theories of Cubism to literature, as in the essay 
<em>Composition as Explanation</em> (1926), which was based on her
lectures at Cambridge and Oxford. After differences emerged between the
Cubists and the post-Impressionists, Stein sided with the former while
her brother Leo championed the latter. Leo, who was left on the shadow
of his sister, once bursted: "She's basically stupid and I'm basically
intelligent." In her book about Picasso (1938) Stein recalled that in
1909 the artist showed her some photographs of a Spanish village to
demonstrate how Cubist in reality they appeared. According to Stein,
Picasso's paintings, such as 'Horta de Ebro' and 'Maison sur la
colline' were almost exactly like the photographs. </p>
<p>Her modernist literary style Stein lauched with <em>The Making of Americans</em>,
a family history and history of whole humanity. It was written between
1906 and 1908 but not published until 1925. Stein tried to translate in
it Cubism's abstraction and disruption of perspective into a prose form
and present an object or an experience from every angle simultaneously.
The effect was reinforced by minimal use of punctuation<font face="Symbol">-</font>"... if writing should go on what had colons and semi-colons to do with it, what had commas to do with it" <font size="2">(from 'Poetry and Grammar', in </font><i><font size="2">Lectures in America</font></i><font size="2">, 1935)</font>.
As a result, her sentences grew longer and longer. Automatic writing, a
technique favored by the Dadaists and Surrealists, also inspired her.</p>
<p>From the United States Stein's friend Mabel Dodge wrote in 1912 with
enthusiasm about the Armory Show, calling it "the most important public
event that has ever come off since the signing of the Declaration of
Independence". The show opened in February 1913 and presented to the
American public modern, revolutionary art from post-Impressionism to
Cubism and Matisse. One of its most notorious exhibits was Marcel
Duchamp's <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i>. Dodge's article, which compared Stein's writing to Picasso's Cubism, appeared in the magazine <i>Art and Decoration</i>. Although Stein met Dodge only a few times, their correspondence lasted over 20 years. </p>
<p>The poetry collection <em>Tender Buttons</em>&nbsp;(1914) was a
series of still live studies, such as 'A Chair', 'A Box', 'Roastbeef',
'End of Summer' and 'Apple'. Each of these is characterized by
unexpected phrases. Her aim was to search ways to name things, "that
would not invent names, but mean names without naming them." Thus
'Apple' reads "Apple plum, carpet steak, seed clam, coloured wine, calm
seen, cold cream, best shake, potato and no gold work with pet, a green
seen is called bake and change sweet is bready, a little piece please."
</p>
<p>When England declared war on Germany, Stein was visiting the
philosopher Alfred North Whitehead in England, with her lover Toklas.
After a brief trip to Majorca in 1915, they returned to Paris, joining
the American Fund For French Wounded. She and Toklas received the
French government's Medaille de la Reconnaissance Française in 1922.
After the war Paris gained fame as a city of "the lost generation", and
replaced Vienna as the cultural center of avant-garde art, music and
literature. </p>

<p>'Miss Furr and Miss Skeene', originally published in <em>Geography and Plays</em>&nbsp;
(1922), told of two women who live together. Within deliberately
limited lexicon, Stein played with the meaning of the word "gay", but
its underground meaning became more widely known when <i>Vanity Fair</i> reprinted the story in 1923. </p>
<p>In 1934 Stein travelled to New York. Her opera about Spanish saints, <em>Four Saints in Three Acts</em>,
music composed by Virgil Thomson, had a huge success with an all-black
cast on Broadway. The opera run for sixty performances. Originally
Thomson did not conceive the score with black performers in mind, but
after seeing Jimmy Daniels perform at a Harlem club, the matter was
settled. The procection was co-ordinated by John Houseman, who later
cooperated with Orson Welles. Thomson's second opera, <em>The Mother of Us&nbsp;All</em>&nbsp;(1947),
was also based on Stein's text. Stein toured America, taught for
several weeks at the University of Chicago, became a lifelong friend of
Thornton Wilder, returned to France next year. In 'Poetry and Grammar',
originally one of the lectures she gave, Stein published her most
famous statement: "A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>A kind of right-wing anarchist, Stein hated Roosevelt and the New
Deal. When many American writers and artists "went Left", Stein did not
take a stand against the Nazi menace in her writings, but suggested to
the Nobel committee that the Peace Prize should be given to Adolf
Hitler. The proposal was rejected. In the thirties and forties she was
a close friend of the collaborationist Bernard Faÿ, the director of the
Bibliothèque national. Toklas and Stein were both Jews, but they
remained in France during World War II, living under the protection
of&nbsp;Faÿ in various country houses. </p><p>Mainly interested in the indivudual, Stein
advocated in her war writings renewing American individuality. "America
is my country and Paris is my home town and it is as it has come to
be," Stein had once said. "After all anybody is as their land and air
is. Anybody is as the sky is low or high, the air heavy or clean and
anybody is as there is wind or no wind there. It is that which makes
them and the arts they make and the work they do and the way they eat
and the way they drink and the way they learn and everything" <font size="2">(from 'An American and France,' 1936). </font>In
December 1944&nbsp;Stein returned to Paris. Faÿ, who helped them to
survive the occupation, was sentenced after the war to life
imprisonment at hard labor. Stein and Toklas campaigned for his
release. Faÿ&nbsp;escaped from a prison hospital to Switzerland. Toklas
sold a Picasso print to help him.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>We cannot retrace our steps, going forward may be the </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">same as going backwards. We cannot retrace our steps, </font><br>
<font size="2">retrace our steps. All my long life, all my long life, we do not </font><br>
<font size="2">retrace our steps, all my long life, but. </font><br>
<font size="2">(A silence a long silence) </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Mother of Us All</font></i><font size="2">, concluding aria) </font></blockquote>
<p>Stein's best known work,<em> The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</em>, is actually her own autobiography. Her later memoirs were<em> Everybody's Autobiography</em> (1937) and <em>Wars I Have Seen</em>
(1945). The last years of her live Stein suffered from cancer. She died
on 27 July 1946 at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.
Toklas was at the bedside; she lived on until 1967. Her memoirs, <i>What is Remembered</i>,
appeared in 1963. Although Stein's works were highly modernistic and
experimental, she also had a strong influence on such popular writer as
Ernest Hemingway, who combined her use of repetitive patterns with
vernacular speech. </p>
