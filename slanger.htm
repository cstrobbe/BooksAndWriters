<p>American philosopher and educatior, whose most widely read and discussed book is 
<i>Philosophy in a New Key</i> (1942), a systematic theory of art. This
Harvard bestseller became a standard text in numerous undergraduate
philosophy classes. Susanne Langer work is not easy to summarize, but
one of her major ideas was that works of art are expressive forms, or
"iconic symbols" of emotions. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the fundamental notion of symbolization&nbsp;</b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><b><font size="2"> mystical, practical, or mathematical, it makes no difference&nbsp;</font></b><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><b><font size="2">
we have the keynote of all humanistic problems. In it lies a new
conception of 'mentality,' that may illumine questions of life and
consciousness, instead of obscuring them as traditional 'scientific
methods' have done."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Philosophy in a New Key</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Susanne Katherina Knauth Langer  was born in New York City, the daughter of Antonio Knauth, a well-to-do lawyer, 
and Else M. (Uhlich) Knauth. Her parents had immigrated to the U.S. from Germany and settled eventually 
in Manhattan's Upper West Side. At home they spoke German and Langer herself never lost her German accent. </p>
<p>Langer was educated at a private school. At home she learned to play the piano and cello quite well. Later 
music had also a central role in her philosophical system. After receiving her B.A. in 1920 from Radcliffe 
College, Langer went to Europe, where she studied at the University of Vienna in 1921-22. She then returned 
to Radcliffe, where she earned a Ph.D. in 1926 with her dissertation dealing with logical analysis of meaning. 
In 1921 she married William L. Langer, a professor of history at Harvard; they had had two sons. While giving 
a lecture in 1938, William Langer had a sudden panic attack and was unable to speak. Although speaking in public was
an ordeal for him during the next two decades and his chronic stage fright 
was never resolved,  he continued as a teacher and lecturer and had an outstanding career as a America's most 
distinguished historian of Europe. In the late 1930s, Langer and her husband began to drift apart 
and eventually they divorced in 1942. William Langer married Rowena Morse Nelson in 1943. 

</p><p>At Radcliffe Langer studied  under the eminent mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, who wrote
 the prefatory note to her book <i>The Practice of Philosophy</i>
(1930). From 1927 to 1942 Langer was a tutor in Philosophy at
Radcliffe. After working as an assistant professor of philosophy at the
University of Delaware, she was a lecturer at Columbia University.
Langer was a visiting professor at New York University, Northwestern
University, Evanston, Illinois, Ohio State University, Columbus,
University of Washington, Seattle, and University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor. In 1954 she was appointed professor of philosophy at Connecticut
College in New London. She was also a member of the faculty. In 1961
she became professor emerita and reserch scholar in philosophy. Langer
was elected in 1960 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She
held also honorary degrees from several American colleges and
universities. In 1950 she received Radcliffe Alumnae Achievement Medal.
In spite of her fame, Langer remained at the edge of contemporary
academic philosophy. </p>
<p>Langer's first book was a collection of fairy tales, <i>The Cruise of the Little Dipper</i> (1923). It was 
illustrated by Helen Sewell, to whom she dedicated one of her later work, <i>Problems in Art</i> (1957), based on her lectures. </p>
<p><i>Philosophy in a New Key,</i> a survey symbolism, became a
best-seller. Langer's earlier absorption into symbolic logic is seen in
her attempt to create a rational basis for aesthetics. The work was
much influenced by <a href="cassir.htm">Ernst Cassirer</a>, whose <i>Sprache und Mythos</i> from 1925 Langer translated into English.  <i>Feeling and Form</i> (1953) was written on a Rockefeller Foundation grant. It developed further the ideas of <i>Philosophy in a New Key</i>, and expanded her system of aesthetics from music to the other fields of arts, painting, poetry, dance, etc. </p>
<p>Like Cassirer, Langer argued that man is essentially a symbol-using animal. Symbolic thought is deeply rooted 
in the human nature &#8211; it is the keynote to questions of life and consciousness, all humanistic problems. "Art 
is the creation of forms symbolic of human feeling," Langer defined. She distinguishes between the 
open "presentational" symbols of art and "discursive" symbols of language, which cannot 
reflect directly the subjective aspect of experience. Langer's view of language is not far from Ludwig 
Wittgenstein's logical theory developed in his <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> (1922), but when 
Wittgenstein stopped on the threshold of the unsayable, Langer argued that "music articulates 
forms which language cannot set forth" &#8211; it shows what cannot be said. </p>
<p>Works of art do not directly express the artist's experienced
emotions, but rather an "idea" of emotion. Artists create virtual
objects, illusions. Thus music creates an auditory apparation of time,
"virtual time," in painting "virtual space" is the primary illusion,
poets create appearances of events, persons, emotional reactions,
places etc, "poetic semblances." Langer argues that musical forms bear
a close logical resemblance to the forms of human feelings. Music is a
"presentational symbol" of psychic process and its tonal structures
bear a close logical similarity to the forms of feeling, "forms of
growth and of attenuation, flowing and stowing, conflict and
resolution, speed, arrest, terrific excitement, calm, or subtle
activation and dreamy lapses." The symbol and the object symbolized
have a common logical form. </p>
<p>Langer also distinguishes art as symbol &#8211; the work of art as an indivisible whole &#8211; from symbols in art, which are 
elements of the work and often have a literal meaning. Langer's unconventional use of the term "symbol" 
has been criticized by a number of philosophers, George Dickie included, but Monroe C. Beardley has noted in his 
book <i>Aesthetics from Classical Greece to the Present</i> (1966), that Langer's general concept of 
art as symbol and its development "is carried through with great sensitivity and concreteness." </p>
<p>After receiving a research grant from the Edgar Kaufmann Charitable Trust, Langer wrote the three-volume <i>Mind: 
An Essay on Human Feeling</i>
(1967-1982), her last book, dealing with "actual living form as
biologist find it... and the actual phenomena of feeling." Part of the
year Langer lived in an old New England farmhouse in Old Lyme,
Connecticut, where she could work in peace and quietness. By the
publication of the third volume, Langer was 87. The conclusion of the
essay was abrogated due to her poor eyesight. Langer died in Old Lyme,
on July 17, 1985. </p>
