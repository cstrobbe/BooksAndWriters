<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific English writer, who published
colorful novels set in unknown regions and lost kingdoms of Africa, or
some other corner of the world: Iceland, Constantinople, Mexico,
Ancient Egypt. Haggard's best-known work is the romantic adventure tale
      <span style="font-style: italic;">King Solomon's Mines</span>
(1885), which was inspired by <a href="rlsteven.htm">Robert Louis
Stevenson</a>'s famous <i>Treasure Island</i>.
Haggard also was an agricultural reformer and a faithful servant of the
British Empire. However, his depiction of other cultures has been
considered more complex than was common in contemporary popular
romances.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Welcome, white men from the
stars," he
said; "this is a different sight from what your eyes gazed on by the
light of last night's moon, but it is not so good a sight. Girls are
pleasant, and were it not for such as these" (and he pointed round him)
"we should none of us be here to- day; but men are better. Kisses and
the tender words of women are sweet, but the sound of the clashing of
men's spears, and the smell of men's blood, are sweeter far! Would ye
have wives from among our people, white men? If so, choose the fairest
here, and ye shall have them, as many as ye will;" and he paused for an
answer.' </b></font><font size="2">(from <i>King Solomon's Mines</i>)
        </font></blockquote>
      <p>Henry Rider Haggard was born in West Bradenham Hall, Norfolk,
the
eight son of
William Haggard, a barrister and a country squire, and Ella (Doventon)
Haggard, an amateur writer. In his childhood, the young Henry Rider was
seen as the family
dunce by his father. Haggard was not sent to a good public school like
his brothers, but he was educated at a London day-school,
although privately, and Ipswich Grammar School. At eighteen he fell in
love with Mary Elizabeth "Lilly" Jackson. She married a few years later
Frank Archer, a banker who was caught in
an embezzlement and deserted her. <br>
      </p>
      <p>After failing the army
entrance, Haggard went in 1875 to Natal as a secretary to Sir Henry
Bulwer, Governor
of Natal colony. In he joined the staff of the special
commissioner.
Next year he became Master and Registrar of the High Court in
the Transvaal. For the rest of his life Haggard viewed with
understanding the British colonial policy, sharing in this the
attitudes of his friend <a href="kipling.htm">Rudyard Kipling</a>. On
the other hand, he also traveled widely and saw the dangers of European
intrusion. Thus in the end of <i>King Solomon's Mines</i> Haggard left
the lost land of the Kukuanas to continue its own separate development.
      </p>
      <p>During his years in Africa, Haggard got acquainted with the
Zulu
culture. Especially he admired the individual prowess of their
warriors: "When death comes, he meets it without fear, and goes to the
spirits of his fathers boldly, as a warrior should." Although Haggard
himself had been brought up to believe in the superiority of European
culture and the Christian religion, he did not condemn the polygamic
system of the Zulus, writing that "the Zulu women are much attached to
the custom, nor would they as a general rule consent to marry a man who
only proposed taking one wife." Haggard himself had an affair with a
married woman, Johanna Catherine Ford (née Lehmkuhl); she gave birth to
a child who died. <br>
      </p>
      <p> Psychoanalytic interpretations of Haggard's novels have paid
much attention to his female characters. Among his devoted reader was <a href="cjung.htm">Carl Jung</a>, who used the novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> She</span> (1887) as an example of <i>anima</i>.
According to Jung, the anima is an archetypical form, expressing the
fact that a man has a minority of female genes. Haggard's Queen Ayesha
is an unmistakable anima type &#8211; the ultimate guide and mediator to the
inner world. The idea has also connections with the oservations of <a href="jfrazer.htm">James Frazer</a> in his classical study <i>The
Golden Bough</i>.
Also Haggard's idea of a journey into the "darkest Africa," which turns
into a spiritual search, has been used my a number of writers,
including Joseph Conrad in <i>Heart of Darkness</i> (1902). </p>
      <p>The narrator of the hallucinatory <i>She</i> is Ludwig Horace
Holly.
The story depicts an adventurer, Leo Vincey, who receives a mysterious
legacy from his father. He goes to Africa to search the truth behind
the death of an ancestor, Kallikrates. He was an Egyptian priest slain
by an ancient sorceress She-Who-Must-Be Oboyed, queen Ayesha, a
2000-year-old ruler of the Lost World of Kôr. With his friends Leo
travels through dangerous regions and reaches catacombs of the Kingdom
of Kôr. There they encounter She, the white Queen of the Amahagger
people. "I could clearly distinguish, however, that the swathed
mummy-like form before me was that of a tall and lovely woman, instinct
with beauty in every part, and also with a certain snake-like grace
which I had never seen anything to equal before." She tells that her
name is Ayesha. "My empire is of thye imagination," she says. Holly
tries to teach her doctrines of Christianity but she answers: "The
religions come and the religions pass, and civilizations come and pass,
and naught endures but the world and human nature." She saves the life
of Leo who is dying <i>&#8211;</i> he was wounded in a fight with cannibals.
Ayesha sees in him Kallikrates. She promises to make him live forever
if they walk together into a pillar of flame. Ayesha enters the Fire of
Life at the heart of an volcano, and emerges from it
immeasurably old. She dies and asks Leo to remember her in her eternal
youth and beauty. "'Kallikrates,' she said in husky, trembling notes.
'Forget me not, Kallikrates. Have pity on my shame; I die not. I shall
come again, and shall once more be beautiful, I swear it &#8211; it is
true!'" Ayesha disintegrates, she is swept back to nothingness. The
story was followed by two sequels, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ayesha&nbsp;</span>
(1905),
in which Haggards asked, "Who and what was Ayesha, nay - what <i>is </i>Ayesha?"
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Wisdom's Daughter</span> (1923).</p>
      <p>After Haggard returned to England, he married in 1880 a
Norfolk
heiress, Mariana Louisa Margitson. They moved to Transvaal to Haggard's
ostrich farm. When Transvaal had to be ceded to the Dutch, they went
back to England, where Haggard continued his law studies. The death of
his son in 1891 was a deep blow for him. Haggard was admitted to the
bar in 1884, but showed little interest in practicing his profession &#8211;
he had other plans. </p>
      <p>After retiring to a Norfolk
country house, Haggard devoted himself into writing. He had earlier
published
a study of contemporary African history. His first books, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dawn</span> (1884) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Witch's Tale</span> (1884), were
undistinguished. According to a story, when R.L. Stevenson's <i>Treasure
Island</i>
appeared in book form in 1883, Haggard did not think much of it, and
made a five-shilling bet with his brother, that he could write better
one. The outcome, created in six weeks, was <i>King Solomon's Mines</i>,
a story of a group of treasure hunters searching legendary diamond mine
in a lost land. In the story Sir Henry Curtis, Captain John Good and
the veteran hunter Allan Quatermain, accompanied by Umbopa, their
native servant, set off to reveal the fate of Curtis's missing brother
&#8211; he has gone to look for the treasure of King Solomon in the land of
Kukuanas. They cross terrifying deserts, nearly freeze in the
mountains, and after a long journey they reach their destination.
Umbopa turns out to be a king, and he wins the villainous King
Twala, who dies in the combat with Curtis. The adventurers find
Solomon's mines, but are left to die in an underground vault by Gagool,
the horrific witch-doctor. After an escape they find Curtis's brother
and return to the civilization. </p>
      <p>The adventure tale became a sensation and Haggard's book has
been in print ever since. Haggard repeated his success with three
novels set in Africa <i>&#8211; She</i>,<span style="font-style: italic;">
Jess</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Allan Quatermain</span>,
all published in 1887. In <i>Allan Quatermain</i> the heroes from <i>King
Solomon's Mines</i>,
Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good, return to Africa disillusioned
with Western culture. Accompanied by Allan Quatermain they journey to
the lost land of Zu-Vendis, where Curtis becomes a king and Quatermain
dies. However, Quatermain appeared again in several other novels. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Allan and the&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ice-Gods</span>
(1927) the hero ingests a hallucinogenic drug and finds his mind
transported to the body of a prehistoric caveman. The author's fantasy
and myth-making later inspired several film directors. <i>Allan
Quatermain</i> (1987), directed by Gary Nelson, was a follow up to
1985's <i>King Solomon's Mines</i>
(1985), directed J. Lee-Thompson and starring Richard Chamberlain and
Sharon Stone. The favorite adventure novel has been filmed half a dozen
times, but none of the films have captured the spirit of Haggard's
original work. </p>
      <p>At the age of thirty-four, Haggard had become a household
name. He
published one to three books a year, in which the setting ranged from
Iceland to the South Seas. Haggard also tried his hand in several forms
of the novel: psychological <span style="font-style: italic;">(Mr
Meeson's Will</span>), historical (<span style="font-style: italic;">Cleopatra</span>)
and fantastic (<span style="font-style: italic;">Stella Fregelius</span>).
During his career, he wrote over 40 books. Many of his titles referred
to a female character or attribute <i>&#8211;</i> <span style="font-style: italic;">Montezuma's Daughter</span> (1894), <span style="font-style: italic;">Pearl Maiden</span> (1903), <span style="font-style: italic;">Queen Sheba's Ring</span> (1910), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Virgin of the Sun</span>
(1922). Although the Victorian age was the first Golden Age of the
ghost story, Haggard's sole attempt in this genre was 'Only a Dream,'
published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Smith and the Pharaohs</span>
(1920), a collection of short stories. With the editor and historian
Andrew Lang he wrote a sequel to Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The World's Desire</span> (1890). <span style="font-style: italic;">Eric Brighteyes </span>(1891) was
Haggard's excursion into the Norse saga. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"And now that time which she
foresaw has
come, and Heaven knows that I have thought of her, poor dear. Ah! those
footsteps of one dead that will echo through our lives, those woman's
footprints on the marble flooring which will not be stamped out. Most
of us have heard and seen them at some time or other, and I hear and
see them very plainly tonight. Poor dead wife, I wonder if there are
any doors in the land where you have gone through which you can creep
out to look at me tonight? I hope that there are none. Death must
indeed be a hell if the dead can see and feel and take measure of the
forgetful faithlessness of their beloved."</b> (from 'Only a Dream') </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1895 Haggard stood unsuccessfully for parliament for East
Norfolk. Between the years 1912 and 1917 he travelled extensively as a
member of the Dominions Royal Commission. Haggard was an expert on
agricultural and social conditions in England and on colonial
migration. His books on farming, such as<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Farmer's Year Book</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Rural England</span>,
were based on long journeys through the country and thoughtful
research.
For his non-fiction, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Poor and the Land </span>(1905), and for his government services,
Haggard was knighted in 1912. In 1919 he was
created Knight Commander of the British Empire. Haggard died in London,
on May 14, 1925. He left behind four completed novels. Three of
Haggard's siblings <i>&#8211;</i> Andrew, Edward, and Eleanora <i>&#8211;</i>
also published fiction, Eleanora under her married title as Baroness
Albert D'Anethan. </p>
      <p> Like his friend <a href="kipling.htm">Rudyard Kipling</a>,
who
celebrated the heroism of British colonial soldiers, Haggard believed
in the British Empire. His works are full of action in colorful
locations. There his protagonists find exotic, hidden societies, and
encounter many dangers and characters with strange powers. In this his
works anticipated <a href="erburrou.htm">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>'s
Tarzan books, or the John Carter stories set in Mars, in which the lost
world idea was applied to science fiction. Haggard's own mythological
world can also be seen as a precursor of <a href="lovecraf.htm">H.P.
Lovecraft</a>'s 'Cthulhu Mythos' stories. </p>
      <p>Although Haggard's novels first were written for adults,
several of
them belong now to the juvenile literature. Some of Haggard's opinions,
especially his
belief of a Jewish world wide conspiracy, have shadowed his later
reputation and otherwise open-minded approach to foreign cultures.
Moreover, the Haggard bloodline included Jewish and Indian relations.
Haggard's diaries, published in 1980, reveal his curiosity to a wide
variety of subjects. His fascination with the Zulu
culture, based on knowledge of history and traditions, can be seen in
his portraits of Umbopa, the rightful king of the land of Kukuanas in <i>King
Solomon's
Mines,</i> and the heroic Umslopogaas in <i>Allan Quatermain</i>, as
well in the
Zulu trilogy <span style="font-style: italic;">Marie</span> (1912), <span style="font-style: italic;">Child of Storm</span> (1913), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Finished</span> (1917). Also in <i>Montezuma's
Daughter</i>,
set in Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest, Haggard showed
sympathy for a threatened culture. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Although married to another, he lived for years close to the
woman he had always loved, Lilly Archer, née Jackson. Secrets of
Haggard's private life have revealed that behind the mask of a
respected Victorian gentleman
was a more complex personality than generally has been known. </p>
