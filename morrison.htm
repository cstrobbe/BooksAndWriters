<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American rock singer and rock lyric who
achieved after his death a cult position among fans. Morrison wished to
be accepted as a serious artist, and he published such collections of
poetry as<i> An American Prayer</i> (1970) and <i>The Lords </i><i>and
The New Creatures </i>(1971). The song lyrics Morrison wrote for The
Doors much reflected the tensions of the time &#8211; drug culture, the
antiwar movement, avant-garde art. With his early death Morrison has
been seen as a voluntary victim of the destructive forces in pop
culture. However, he was not ignorat about the consequences of fame and
his position as an idol. Morrison once confessed that "We're more
interested in the dark side of life, the evil thing, the night time." </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2">"This is the end, </font><font size="2">beautiful friend. </font><br>
        <font size="2">It hurts to set you free, <br>
But you'll never follow me. <br>
The end of laughter and soft lies. <br>
The end of nights we tried to die. <br>
This is the... end."</font></b></blockquote>
      <p>James Douglas Morrison was born in Melbourne, Florida, on
December 8, 1943. His father, George &#8220;Steve&#8221; Morrison, was a U.S. Navy
admiral, born in Georgia in 1920. In 1942, after graduating from the
Naval Academy, he had married Clara (Clarke) Morrison, the daughter of
a lawyer. In 1946 he returned from the Pacific and during the following
years the family moved according to his numerous postings. Jim was
their eldest son. When he began performing in public, he broke with his
father and mother and never saw them again. George Morrison died in
2008. </p>
      <p>Morrison was early interested in literature, he excelled at
school, and he had an IQ of 149. Morrison studied theatre arts at the
University of California. With his fellow student Ray Manzarek,
keyboardist, John Densmore, drummer, and Robbie Kriger, guitarist, he
formed a group which was in 1965 christened The Doors. They never added
a bass player to their group. Its name was taken from <a href="ahuxley.htm">Aldous Huxley</a>'s book on mescaline, <i>The
Doors of Perception</i>, which quoted <a href="wblake.htm">William
Blake</a>'s poem ("If the doors of perception were cleansed / All
things would appear infinite"). All the members of the band read much,
not only Morrison. Their first album, <i>The Doors</i> (1967), mixed
performances from <a href="brecht.htm">Bertolt Brecht</a>/Kurt Weil's
'Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)' to Willie Dixon's 'Back Door Man'. It also
included such Doors classics as 'Break on Through' (to the Other Side)'
and 'The End'. The lyrics Morrison wrote in 1965 dominated the first
two Doors albums. In July 1967 the band had its first single chart
success with 'Light My Fire'. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Between childhood, boyhood, </b></font><b><br>

        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Wilderness</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font></blockquote>
      <p> Like in the late 1950s when the <a href="kerouac.htm">beatniks
      </a>tried to unite jazz and poetry, Morrison found from music a
channel to project his poetry, and add to it a theatrical aspect. Thus
improvising and unpredictableness was a part of the band's show on
stage. The mythical Lizard King, Morrison's alter ego, appeared first
in the best-selling record <i>Waiting for the Sun</i> (1968) in a poem
that was printed inside the record jacked. I was entitled 'The
Celebration of the Lizard King'. Part of the lyrics were used in 'Not
to Touch the Earth' and the complete 'Celebration' appeared on record <i>Absolutely
Live</i> (1970). </p>
      <p> Morrison's drinking, exhibitionistic performances, and
drug-taking badly affected his singing and input at recordings<font size="2">. </font>"Let's just say I was testing the bounds of
reality," he confessed in 1969 in Los Angeles. "I was curious to see
what would happen. That's all it was: just curiosity." In Miami in 1969
the audience thought it saw Jim's "snake" &#8211; he was charged with
exposing himself on stage, in full view of 10.000 people. The police
did not arrest him on the spot, for fear that it would cause a riot.
Next year Morrison was sentenced 8 months' hard labor and a $500 fine
for "profanity" and "indecent exposure", but he remained free while the
sentence was appealed against. <i>The Soft Parade </i>(1969), which
experimented with brass sections, was received with mixed emotions but
it had a hit single, 'Touch me'. </p>
      <p>After Miami everything changed and Morrison put his leather
pants in closet. He grew a beard, started to take distance to his fans,
and devote more time with projects outside the band. John Densmore has
later told in an interview, that although he knew Jim well, there was
so much about him that he could not find out. Possessed by his inner
visions and urge to write and create music, Morrison also had troubles
to explain his aims. He also felt that his time was running short: "O
great creator of being, grant us one more hour / to perform our art and
perfect our lives." </p>
      <p>In April 1970 <i>Morrison Hotel </i>hit the lists in the
U.S. and England. It was hailed as a major comeback. One song on it,
'Queen of the Highway', was dedicated Pamela Courson, his common-law
wife, who called herself Pamela Morrison. Jim called Pamela his "cosmic
mate". Morrison had also an affair with Linda Ashcroft from 1967 to
1971. With Patricia Kennealy, a rock critic, he had romance which
started in 1969; supposedly they were joined in a Wiccan ceromony,
known as a Handfasting. Morrison did not take the ritual seriously. </p>
      <p>On his 27th birthday, Morrison made the recordings at
Elektra's LA studio of his poetry, which later formed the basis of <i>An
American Prayer</i>. The Doors played their last concert with Morrison
in New Orleans. It was a disaster &#8211; Morrison smashed the microphone
into the stage, threw the stand into the crowd and slumped down. </p>
      <p>After finishing sessions for a new album, <i>L.A. Woman</i>,
Morrison escaped to Paris, where he hoped to follow literary career.
"See me change," he sang. He never came back from Paris. <br>
</p>
      <p>Allen Ginsberg's <span style="font-style: italic;">Howl!</span>
had a major influence on Morrison's writings. He also had listened
Ginsberg recite his poems and once chatted with him in a Jefferson Airplane
concert. Morrison's first
book, <i>The Lords and the New Creatures</i>, was published by Simon
and Schuster in 1971. It went into paperback after selling 15.000 in
hardback. An earlier book, <i>An American Prayer</i>, was privately
printed in 1970, but not made widely available until 1978. On 3 July
1971 Morrison was found death in his bathtub. He had regurgitated a
small amount of blood on the night of July 2, but claimed he felt fine.
Recently had consulted a local doctor concerning a respitory problem. </p>

      <p>Morrison was buried at Pére Lachaise cemetary in Paris, which
houses remains of many famous artists, statesmen and legendaries from
Edith Piaf to Oscar Wilde. In 1990 his graffitti-covered headstone was
stolen. Pamela Courson Morrison, died in Hollywood of heroin overdose
on April 25, 1974. In 1979 Francis Ford Coppola used The Doors'
performance of 'The End' in his Vietnam War film, <i>Apocalypse Now</i>,
and in 1991 director Oliver Stone made the film biography <i>The Doors</i>,
starring Val Kilmer. <i>Wilderness: The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison</i>
was published in 1989. It was compiled from the Morrison literary
estate by his friends. </p>
