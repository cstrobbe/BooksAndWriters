<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American novelist who also worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood. Hammett's best known books include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Maltese Falcon</span>
(1930), filmed three times. It introduced detective Sam Spade who is
investigating the murder of his colleague, detective Archer. Spade
finds himself involved with an odd assortment of characters, all
searching for a black statue of a bird. Among them are the gorgeous
redhead Brigid O'Shaughnessy, her employer, Fat Man Casper Gutman, Joel
Cairo, an agent of Gutman, and Wilmer Cook, a nervous, trigger-happy
bodyguard.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Samuel Spade's jaw was long and bony,
his chin a jutting V under the more flexible V of his mouth. His
nostrils curved back to make another smaller V. His yellow-grey eyes
were horizontal. The V motif was picked up again by thickish brows
rising outward from twin creases above a hooked nose, and his pale
brown hair grew down &#8211; from high flat temples &#8211; in a point on his
forehead. He looked rather pleasantly like a blond satan."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Maltese Falcon</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="rchandle.htm">Raymond Chandler</a> Hammett represented
the early realistic vein in detective stories. His tough heroes
confront violence with full knowledge of its corrupting potential. In
his novels Hammett painted a mean picture of the American society,
where greed, brutality, and treachery are the major driving forces
behind human actions.</p>
<p>Dashiell Hammett was born in St. Mary's County, Maryland, the son of
Richard Hammett, a farmer and politician. Hammett's mother, Annie Bond
Dashiell, was trained as a nurse, but was at home most of the time
looking after her three children. The family moved to Philadelphia, and
then to Baltimore. Hammett studied at the Baltimore Polytechnic
Institute but left school at the age of 14 to help support the family.
He worked as a newsboy, freight clerk, labourer, messenger, stevedore,
and advertising manager before joining the Baltimore office of the
Pinkerton Detective Agency as an operator. In Butte, Montana, he was
offered money to kill the IWWW labour organizer Frank Little, who was
later lynched. After the murder, Hammett's political views became more
radical and he resigned from Pinkerton's first time. </p>
<p>During World War I Hammett served a sergeant in an ambulance corps.
At that time the worldwide Spanish influenza epidemic spread fast, and
especially in military installations. Hammett contracted tuberculosis.
"I have always had good health until I contracted influenza,
complicated by bronchial pneumonia treatment," Hammett told his doctor
in 1919. He spent the rest of the war in hospital, and for much of his
life suffered from ill health. He rejoined the agency and worked then
intermittently to earn extra money &#8211; Hammett's pension was small and he
now had his own family to support. Most of Hammett's income during
1922-1926 came from writing advertising copy for a San Francisco
jewelry store. At this time the investigator known as Continental Op
was introduced in the author's stories.</p>
<p>Hammett's first short story appeared in the magazine <i>Black Mask </i>on 1 October 1923, and his fiction writing career as novelist ended in 1934. In <i>Black Mask</i> Hammett became along with <a href="gardner.htm">Erle Stanley Gardner</a>
one of its most popular writers. Under the pseudonym Peter Collinson,
Hammett introduced a short, overweight, unnamed detective employed by
the San Francisco branch of the Continental Detective Agency, who
became known as The Continental Op. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the three dozen stories between
1929 and 1930, featuring the tough and dedicated Op, Hammett gave shape
to the first believable detective hero in American fiction. Drawing on
his Pinkerton experiences, Hammett created a private eye, whose methods
of detection are completely convincing, and whose personality has more
than one dimension. Op stories also appeared in hardcover form.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Red Harvest</span> (1929) was a loosely constructed story about corruption and gangsters, set in 'Poisonville', and in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dain Curse</span> (1929) Op unravels a mystery involving jewel theft, religious cults, a family curse, a bombing, and a ghost. </p>

<p>However, in 1929 Hammett turned his attention to a new private eye,
Sam Spade, who made his initial appearance in Black Mask in September
1929. Next year the work appeared in book form. Hammett's language was
unsentimental, journalistic; moral judgments were left to the reader.
The first-person narration of the Op stories is left behind and Hammett
views the detective protagonist in the book from the outside. A
beautiful woman, Brigid O'Shaughnessy, comes to the office of Spade and
his partner Miles Archer. She asks them to trail a Floyd Thursby.
Archer is murdered. His wife was seeking a divorce to marry Spade. Joel
Cairo offers Spade a reward for the recovery of a statuette, the
'Maltese Falcon'. Also Casper Gutman, a fat man, seeks it, with the
help of Wilmer, an evil young man. An imitation in lead is found and
Spade calls for the police to arrest Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer. Brigid,
who has been involved in the quest for the falcon, confesses that she
killed Archer. Spade doesn't protect her from the consequences, but
turns her in. "Listen. When a man's partner's killed, he's supposed to
do something about it. It doesn't make any difference what you thought
of him. He was your partner and you're supposed to do something about
it."<font size="2"> (Bogart in </font><i><font size="2">The Maltese Falcon</font></i><font size="2">). </font>This philosophy also marked Hammett's attitudes when he was questioned about his Communist contacts &#8211; he did not reveal them. </p>
<p>In<i> The Maltese Falcon</i> Spade became the personification of the
American private eye, thanks in no small degree to Humphrey Bogart's
portrayal of him in the 1941 screen adaptation of the novel. However,
Hollywood had already found Hammett's work much earlier on. <i>Roadhouse Nights</i>, directed by Hobart Henley, was based on Hammett's <i>Red Harvest</i>, and released by Paramount in 1930. <i>The Maltese Falcon </i>was filmed for the first time in 1931 and then in 1936 under the title <i>Satan Met a Lady</i>,
directed by William Dieterle and starring Bette Davis. The falcon was
changed into a gem-filled ram's horn. John Huston's adaptation from
1941 is the most famous. "But we were all having such a good time
together on Falcon that, night after shooting, Bogie, Peter Lorre, Ward
Bond, Mary Astor and I would go over to the Lakeside Country Club. We'd
have a few drinks, then a buffet supper, and stay on till midnight. We
all thought we were doing something good, but no one had any idea that<i> The Maltese Falcon</i> would be a great success and eventually take its place as a film classic."<font size="2"> (John Huston in </font><i><font size="2">An Open Book</font></i><font size="2">, 1981) </font></p>
<p>In 1943 Hammett had screenplay credits for the adaptation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Watch On Rhine</span>
by Lillian Hellman. She had become Hammett's companion in the 1930s.
Hammett was first married to nurse Josephine Dolan, whom he met in the
Cushman Institute in the early 1920s. When Hammett was transferred to
the hospital at Camp Kearney near San Diego, he started to write to her
regularly. "This is the first time I ever felt that way about a woman;
perhaps it's the first time I have ever really loved a woman. That
sounds funny but it may be the truth." <font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> Selected Letters of Dashiell Hammett 1921-1960</font></i><font size="2">, edited by Richard Layman with Julie M. Rivett, 2001) </font>Hammett
and Josephine were married in 1921. <br>
</p>
      <p>After the birth of his second
daughter, Hammett's illness partly ended his family life &#8211; doctors
warned Josephine of the risk of infection, and she took a house north
of San Francisco, where Hammett visited during weekends. Formally they
divorced in 1937. Josephine left her work as a nurse and Hammett sent
his family money, more or less regularly. Reciprocally Josephine sent
him her picture, in which she did not smile. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Ned Beaumont stood up. He picked up his
overcoat. He took his cap out of his overcoat pocket and, holding it in
one hand, his overcoat over the other arm, said seriously: 'You'll be
sorry.' The he walked out in a dignified manner. The Kid's rasping
laughter and Lee's shriller hooting followed him out."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Glass Key</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Glass Key</span> (1930), about
munincipal politics at its lowest, was apparently Hammett's favorite
among his novels. The central character, Ned Beaumont, was partly a
self-portrait: a tall, thin, tuberculosis-ridden gambler and heavy
drinker. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Thin Man</span> (1934),
Hammett's last novel, presented Nick Charles, a former detective who
had married a rich woman, Nora Charles. Her character was based on <a href="lhellman.htm">Lillian Hellman</a>.
The book gained a commercial success and inspired a series of
adaptations for film, radio, and TV. With Alex Raymond, the creator and illustrator of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Flash Gordon</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Rip Kirby</span>, Hammett cooperated in 1934 on <span style="font-style: italic;">Secret Agent X-9</span>,
a comic strip. The character had no name, and Hammett did not clearly
define, if the Agent X-9 was a spy, a detective, or a G-man. <br>
</p>
      <p>Hammett's earnings from his books and their spin-offs allowed
him to continue drinking and womanizing. After signing an agreement
with MGM, he wrote at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles the
first draft for <span style="font-style: italic;">After the Thin Man: The Thin Man Sequel</span>. Directed by   W.S. Van Dyke and William Powell and Myrna Lot starring again, it was released with excellent reviews in December 1936. <span style="font-style: italic;">Another Thin Man </span>was
released in November 1938. The studio rejected Hammett's idea for a
fourth Nick and Nora Charles movie, and cancealed his contract. Hunt
Stromberg produced three more <span style="font-style: italic;">Thin Man</span> movies; the screenplays were not written by Hammett.&nbsp;  <br>
      </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Well, Hammett and I had a good time together. Most of it, not all of it. We were amused by each other."</b> (Lillian Hellman in Playwright at Work, ed.  </font><i><font size="2">George Plimpton</font></i><font size="2">, 2000) </font></blockquote>
<p>In the 1930s Hammett became politically active. He joined the
Communist Party and was a fierce opponent of Nazism. However, when
Hemingway and a number of other writers went to Spain to help the
Republicans in the Civil War (1936-39), Hammett remained in the U.S.,
but helped veterans after their return from the war. at that time
Hellman's star was rising. Hammett himself was drinking heavily and had
problems with his writing, but his support was crucial for Hellman's
own career. She had success as a playwright, travelled in Spain, and
had an affair with John Melby, a diplomat. <br>
</p>
      <p>During World War II
tubercular Hammett served three years in the US Army, editing a
newspaper for the troops in the Aleutian Islands. This was perhaps the
last, relatively happy period in his life. In 1948 he was vice-chairman
of the Civil Rights Congress, an organization that the Attorney General
and F.B.I. deemed subversive. He tried to start writing again, hired a
secretary, but managed only to produce some notes. </p>

<p>For his political beliefs Hammett became a target during McCarthy's
anti-Communist crusade. Before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee,
headed by the Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, he invoked the Fifth
Amandment when asked if he was then or had been a member of the
Communist party. Rather than testify at the trial of four communists
accused of conspiracy, he went to prison in 1951 for five months. In
addition, Hammett was blacklisted and when Internal Revenue Service
claimed that he owed a huge amount in tax deficiencies, the federal
government attacked his income. For a while the State Department kept
his books away from the shelves of American libraries overseas.
However, President Eisenhower told a news conference that he thought
"someone got frightened" and he would not himself have removed the
books. </p>
<p>The rest of his life Hammett lived in and around New York, teaching
creative writing in Jefferson School of Social Science from 1946 to
1956. He rented a small house in Katonah, where books piled on chairs,
shelfs, and the floor, and his desk was full of unanswered mail.
Lillian Hellman cared for him in her Park Avenue apartment from 1956.
She wasn't afraid of contracting tuberculosis, but was aware of
Hammett's venereal diseases he had on occasion. Hammett died penniless
of lung cancer on January 10, 1961. "Hammett refused all medication,
all aid from nurses and doctors, in some kind of mysterious wariness,"
recalled Hellman in an acticle<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">The New York Review of Books</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">March 3, 1966).</font></p>
