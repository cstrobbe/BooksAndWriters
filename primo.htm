<p>Italian-Jewish writer and chemist, who first gained fame with his autobiographical story <span style="font-style: italic;">Se questo è un uomo</span>
(1947, If This is a Man) of survival in Nazi concentration camps. For
the last forty years of his life Levi devoted himself to attempting to
deal with the fact that he was not killed in Auschwitz. "The worst
survived, that is, the fittest; the best all died," he said. Levi also
published poetry, science fiction, essays, and short stories. In 1987,
at the age of 67, he killed himself. Italo Calvino called Levi "one of
the most important and gifted writers of our time." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Consider whether this is a man, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Who labours in the mud </font><br>
<font size="2">Who knows no peace </font><br>
<font size="2">Who fights for a crust of bread </font><br>
<font size="2">Who dies at a yes or a no. </font><br>

<font size="2">As a frog in winter. </font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'Shemá', <i>Collected Poems</i>, 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>Primo Levi was born in Turin into a Jewish middle-class family, the
son of Cesare Levi, an engineer, and Ester "Rina" Luzzati; she had been
his secretary. His grandmother Bimba was a baroness. She and her entire
family had been made barons by Napoleon, because they had supported him
economically. As a youth Levi knew very little about Jewishness, but
Mussolini's anti-Semitic policy soon taught Levi that it was not ''a
cheerful little anomaly'' in a Catholic country. <br>
</p>
      <p>An underdeveloped, quiet boy, Levi was derided at school for
his size. Through cycling and mountain climbing he acquired friends,
but according to a biography he did not have any sexual experience
before meeting his wife, Lucia, in 1946. Just before the Fascist racial
law of 1938 forbade Jews access to academic status, Levi started his
chemistry studies at the University of Turin. He graduated first in his
class in 1941, the year after Italy had entered World War II as an ally
of Germany. During the war Levi wrote for the resistance magazine <i>Giustizia e Libertà</i>. </p>

<p>After the collapse of Mussolini's regime, he tried to contact a partisan group in the north of Italy. 
Levi was captured in December 1943. "I was twenty-four," Levi wrote in  <i>If This Is a Man</i>,
"with little wisdom, no experience and a decided tendency ... to live
in an unrealistic world of my own, a world inhabited by civilized
Cartesian phantoms, by sincere male and bloodless female friendships."
He was first interned in a transit camp in Fòssoli, and then, two
months later, deported to the camp of Moniwitz-Auschwitz. The number
174517 was tattooed on his left forearm. </p>
<p>From the railroad convoy of 650 people, fifteen men and nine women
survived. Levi worked at one of three I.G. Farben laboratories and was
spared the gas chambers. The company made synthetic rubber for the Nazi
war machine. As a chemist he knew he could safely eat cotton wool and
drink paraffin. A non-Jewish guest worker secretly gave him extra
helpings of soup. To his friend Jean Samuel he taught Italian by
quoting Dante; eating and translating Dante were both keys to survival.
Dante remained a constant point of reference throughout Levi's writing.
From the Ulysses episode of <i>Inferno</i> he chose a passage, which
dealt with the crucial question "What is a man?" Levi's superior in the
laboratory, Dr. Ferdinand Mayer, gave him a pair of leather shoes. </p>
<p>Liberated by the Soviets in January 1945, Levi returned to Turin in
October. He took up his work as a chemist, living in a stately old
building that his family had occupied for three generations. In 1961
Levi became the general manager of a factory producing paints. He
retired in 1977 to become a full-time writer. With Hety Schmitt-Maas,
whose husband had been a chemist for I.G. Farben, Levi corresponded
almost 20 years. She also helped Levi to track down Dr. Meyer and sent
him German books and newspaper clippings on Nazism. </p>
<p>His prison recollections Levi wrote in the form of a memoir, <i>Se questo è un uomo</i>,
which documented how the camp deprived prisoners of their identity and
finally annihilated them. When the major publisher Einaudi rejected the
work, it was published by a small house. Ten years later it was
reprinted in an enlarged edition. In Italy the book sold over half a
million copies, was translated into eight languages and adapted for the
theater and radio. Part of the book's impact was based on Levi's sober
and precise style. In spite of the brutality to which he was subjected
Levi described the terrible events objectively like an observing
scientist, but also noted with compassion the heroism in the suffering.</p>
<p>Its sequel, <span style="font-style: italic;">La tregua</span>
(1963), portrayed Levi's wanderings in war-torn eastern Europe in
Poland, Belorussia, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania. During the
journey Levi meets a gallery of colorful, rootless companions in
misfortune, among them Mordo Nahum, a Greek, from whom Levi learns that
in war you must first think of shoes, then the food. Without shoes you
can't go after food. Levi returns home on the last pages of his
account, but he has a continual nightmare in which his present life
turns out to be a mere illusion and he wakes up with Auschwitz's
morning call: "Wstawac". But Levi also uses his experiences as a basis
for philosophical meditations, which connects the book to Jorge
Semprún's<i> L'écriture ou la vie</i> (1994, Literature or Life), dealing with the return to life after the camp.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is not at all an idle matter trying to define what a human being is."</b></font></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">La chiave a stella</span> (1978,
The Monkey's Wrench) presented vivid stories told by Libertini
Faussone, a construction worker and self-educated philosopher. The
writer-chemist listens to him, and records his experiences in different
parts of the world. "All kids dream of going into the jungle or the
desert of Malaya, and I also had those dreams, only I like to have my
dreams come true; otherwise they're like some disease you carry around
with you all your life, or like the scar of an operation that, whenever
the weather turns damp, it starts aching again." <br>
</p>
      <p>Among Levi's other works is <span style="font-style: italic;">Il sistema periodico</span>
(The Periodic Table, 1975), which uses the Russian chemist Mendeleyev's
periodical table of elements as the basis of autobiographical
meditations. Its 21 pieces are each named after a chemical element.
"Every element brings a kind of 'click' for me," Levi wrote. "It
triggers a memory." 'Argon' is a homage to the author's Jewish
ancestors. 'Vanadium' represents Levi's uncanny encounter with a former
official in Auschwitz, Dr. Müller, who was the chief of the laboratory,
and 'Zinc', a boring metal, explorers the fascist myth of racial
purity. <span style="font-style: italic;">Se non ora, quando?</span>
(1982, If Not Now, When?) combined the emergence of Jewish
consciousness and documentation of action taken on the Russian front by
partisan Jewish groups against retreating Nazi forces. A group of
Jewish partisans moves toward Palestine, blows up trains, and rescues
victims of concentration camps. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Two years before the war began, the bell
rope broke. It snapped near the top; the stairs were rotten; the bell
ringer was an old man, and he was afraid to climb up there and put in a
new rope. So after he announced the time by shooting a hunting rifle
into the air; one shot, or two or three or four, That went on till the
Germans came. They took his gun away from him, and the village was left
without any time." </b>(from</font><i><font size="2"> If Not Now, When?</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Levi died in Turin on April 11, 1987. His death was apparently a suicide <font face="Symbol">-</font>
Levi hurled himself down the central stairwell of his home building.
Before and after Auschwitz Levi had suffered from depression, but his
death was interpreted as a sign that he had not triumphed over his
horrible experiences.</p>
      <p>In a lecture in 1979 Levi had expressed his deeply pessimistic
view of humanity, seeing life as terrible. The last work he completed
was the essay collection <span style="font-style: italic;">I sommersi e i salvati</span>
(1986), where Levi returned to his belief in the historical uniqueness
of the Holocaust. He asked how much of the camp is alive and well in
our time, and how long it will remain in our memories. Levi points out
that anti-Semitism was part of German culture, not merely a Nazi
invention, and sees a paradoxical analogy between victim and oppressor.
In the camp system also the oppressed unconsciously strove to identify
with their oppressor. Useless violence dehumanises both guards and
prisoners. "Before dying the victim must be degraded, so that the
murderer will be less burdened by guilt," he stated. </p>
