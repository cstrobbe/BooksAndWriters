<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Writer, official and bureaucrat, the outstanding English poet before <a href="shakespe.htm">William 
Shakespeare</a>. Geoffrey Chaucer is remembered as the author of <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,
which ranks as one of the greatest epic works
of world literature. Chaucer made a crucial contribution to English
literature in writing in English at a time when much court poetry was
still composed in Anglo-Norman or Latin. Although he spent one of two
brief periods of disfavor, Chaucer lived the whole of his life close
the centers of English power. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'My lige lady, generally,' quod he, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">'Wommen desiren to have sovereynetee </font><br>
<font size="2">As wel over hir housbond as hir love.' </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Canterbury Tales</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Geoffrey Chaucer was born in London. His name was of French origin
and meant shoemaker. Chaucer was the son of a prosperous wine merchant
and deputy to the kings's butler, and his wife Agnes. Little is known
of his early education, but his works show that he could read French,
Latin, and Italian. The exists no memoirs of Chaucer, but <i>Canterbury Tales</i> perhaps gives a sight of the writer: </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Thou lookest as thou woulds find an hare, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">For ever upon the ground I see thee stare. </font><br>
<font size="2">Approache near, and looke merrily. </font><br>
<font size="2">Now ware you, sire, and let this man have space. </font><br>
<font size="2">He in the waist is shapen as well as I; </font><br>
<font size="2">This were a puppet in an arm, to embrace </font><br>
<font size="2">For any woman, small, and fair of face. </font><br>
<font size="2">He seemeth elvish by his countenance, </font><br>
<font size="2">For unto no wight doth he dalliance."</font></b><font size="2"></font></blockquote>
<p>Chaucer&#8217;s career in the royal service began in 1357, when he was
appointed to the household of Elizabeth, Countess of Ulster, and her
husband Prince Lionel. In 1359-1360 Chaucer went to France with Edward
III's army during the Hundred Years' War. He was captured in the
Ardennes and returned to England after the treaty of Brétigny in 1360.
It it said that during this period he translated from the French the
allegory <i>Romaunt of the Rose</i>, which was his first literary
work. Chaucer was so valued as a skilled professional soldier that his
ransom, £16, then a tidy sum, was paid by his friends and King Edward.
There is no certain information of his life from 1361 until c.1366,
when he perhaps married Philippa Roet, the sister of John Gaunt's
future wife, and one of Queen Philippa's ladies. Philippa apparently
gave him two sons, 'little Lewis', to whom Chaucer addressed <i>A Treatise on the Astrolabe</i>
(1391), and Thomas, who was later highly successful in public service.
Philippa died in 1387 and Chaucer enjoyed Gaunt's patronage throughout
his life. He was in the King's service, held a number of positions at
court, and spent some time in Spain. </p>
<p>Between 1367 and 1378 Chaucer made several journeys abroad on
diplomatic and commercial missions. It is possible that he met Giovanni
Boccaccio or Petrarch in pre-Renaissance Italy in 1372-73. And it is
said that the example of Dante gave him the idea of writing in the
vulgar English rather than in the court French of the day. In 1374 he
became a government official at the port of London, holding the post of
Comptroller of the Customs and Subside of Wools, Skins, and Tanned
Hides. During that time he was charged with rape, but his guilt or
innocence has never been determined. In 1380 he paid Cecile Champaigne
for withdrawing the suit. <br>
</p>
      <p>Chaucer lost his employment and his rent-free home  in 1385. He then moved
to Kent where he was appointed as justice of the peace. Chaucer was
also elected to Parliament. This was a period of great creativity for
him, during which he produced most of his best poetry, among others <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> (c. 1385), based on a love story by Boccaccio. </p>

<p>When his wife died, according to records, Chaucer was sued for debt.
Several of his friends were executed by the Merciless Parliament. In
1389 Richard II regained control and Chaucer reentered the service of
the crown as Clerk of the King's Works, to upkeep and repair
governmental buildings in and out of London. Later in the 1390s he
received royal gifts and pensions. Chaucer seems to have been in
attendance (1395-96) on Henry Bolingbroke, John of Gaunt's son, who
deposed Richard II in 1399 and who, as Henry IV, increased Chaucer's
annuity. </p>
<p>The last years of his life Chaucer lived at Greenwich, "an Inne of Shrews," as the Host calls it in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,
referring perhaps to the occasion when he was held up or mugged there,
not once but twice in the same day. According to tradition, Chaucer
died in London on October 25, 1400. He did not leave a will and it has
been speculated that he was murdered. The regime of Thomas Arundel,
Archbishop of Canterbury, did not accept attacks on the clergy and the
ideas of the Lollards, who wanted to return to the apostolic poverty.
Chaucer himself had friends who supported the reformist movement.
Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey, in the part of the church
which afterwards came to be called Poet's Corner. Virtually all the
surviving manuscripts of his work date from the fifteenth century. A
monument was erected to him in 1555. </p>
<p>Chaucer took his narrative inspiration for his works from several sources, such as the <i>Romance

of the Rose</i> by Guillaume de Loris, <a href="ovidius.htm">Ovid</a>'s poems, and such Italian authors as <a href="dante.htm">Dante</a>, <a href="petrarca.htm">Petrarch</a>,
and Boccaccio. Their works he may have read during his travels in
Italy. Chaucer remained still entirely individual poet, gradually
developing his personal style and techniques. He must have heard a
number of tales in his life time, it was the most common entertainment
in the period of Black Death, popular unrest, serfdom, peasant revolts,
foreign and local wars. </p>
<p>His first narrative poem, <i>The Book of the Duchess</i>, was
probably written shortly after the death of Blanche, Duchess of
Lancaster, first wife of John Gaunt, in September 1369. It was based
largely on French sources, particularly the Toman de la Rose and
several works of Guillaume de Machaut. His next important work, <i>The House of Fame</i>, was written between 1374 and 1385, and draw on the works of Ovid, Vergil, and Dante. Soon afterward Chaucer translated the <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> by Boethius, and wrote the poem <i>Parliament of Birds</i>. No copies have survived of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Book of the Leoun</span>.<br>
  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><font size="2">"This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo, </font><br>
<font size="2">And we been pilgrymes, passing to and fro. </font><br>
<font size="2">Deet is an ende of every worldly soore." </font></b></p>

</blockquote>
 
<p>Chaucer's writing developed from a period of French influence in the
late 1360s, through his 'middle period' of both French and Italian
Influences, to the last period. Chaucer did not begin working on the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>
until he was in his early 40s. The book, which was left unfinished when
the author died, has a framing narrative like much medieval literature.
It depicts a pilgrimage by some 30 people, who are going on a spring
day in April to the shrine of the martyr, St. Thomas à Becket. En route
to and from Canterbury they amuse themselves by telling stories.
Chaucer himself knew well the road and its inns. Harry Bailly, the
innkeeper, promises a free meal for the best storyteller. Chaucer's own
narration, called 'The Tale of Sir Thopas', is interrupted by Bailly,
who thunders "Namoore of this, for Goddes dignitee,' claiming that the
"rymyng is nat worth a toord!" <br>
</p>
      <p>When Dante's journey in <i>The Divine Comedy </i>ended in
spiritual purification, Chaucer's pilgrims learn about the weakness of
human nature, women's mastery over men, and how a canon cheated a
priest. In the so-called 'Retraction', which comes after the Parson's
Tale has been concluded, Chaucer regrets having written "many a song
and many a leccherous lay". However, Chaucer do not deny that "the
period of pilgrimage" could not end with blessedness. The rather
democratic band of pilgrims consists of unprivileded and aristocrats <font face="Symbol">-</font>
there is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant,
a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. It must be remembered, that
Chaucer himself did not belong even the minor nobility, but from his
youth he was used to associate with highly influential people. </p>

<p>Chaucer's innovation was to use such a diverse assembly of
narrators, whose stories are interrupted and interlinked with
interludes in which the characters talk with each other, revealing much
about themselves. His sources included Boccaccio's <i>Teseida</i>, on which he based 'The Knight&#8217;s Tale,' <i>The Wedding of Sir Gawen and Dame Ragnell</i>, and Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>. He never mentions <i>Decamerone</i>,
which he perhaps never read thoroughly. The rhyming verse was written
in what is called Middle English, an old form of the language that
differs from the English used today, but Chaucer's style and techniques
were imitated through centuries. Shakespeare borrowed his plot for the
drama <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, John Dryen and <a href="apope.htm">Alexander Pope</a> modernized some of his tales. <font face="Symbol">-</font>
"He must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature,
because, as it has been truly observed of him, he has taken into the
compass of his <i>Canterbury Tales</i> the various manners and humour (as we now call them) of the whole English nation in his age."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(John Dryden in </font><i><font size="2">Preface to the Fables</font></i><font size="2">, 1700) </font>
