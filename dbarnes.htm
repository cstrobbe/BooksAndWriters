<p>Avant-garde American writer, illustrator, playwright, and a
well-known figure in the literary scenes of Paris and London before
World War II. Barnes' experimental work is characterized by malevolent
characters, dark humour and decadent flavor. Her most famous novel, <i>Nightwood </i>(1936),
a stream-of-consciousness narrative, has become a cult classic. It was
rejected by American publishers, but finally accepted by Faber &amp;
Faber after <a href="tseliot.htm">T.S. Eliot</a>'s recommendations. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Barnes knew most intimately many lesbians, such as the subjects of her in-joke satire, <i>Ladies Almanack</i>, including Natalie Barney, Janet Flanner, and Dolly Wilde, who had absolutely no relationship to the women she described in <i>Nightwood</i>...
Barnes also knew enough to agree with Natalie Barney that Proust's
treatment of flighty lesbians who follow gay male patterns of cruising
and sexual contacts in <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i> was
"improbable." Yet Barnes's treatment in her own novel was not much
different. It attests to the power of literary images over lesbian
writers that, even after criticizing Proust's lies, Barnes called on
her knowledge of lesbians in literature rather than in life in order to
write her own novel."</b> (Lillian Faderman in</font><i><font size="2"> Surpassing the Love of Men</font></i><font size="2">, 1994) </font></blockquote>
<p>Djuna Barnes was born in Cornwall-on-Hudson. Her wealthy and
free-spirited father, Henry Budington ("Wald") Barnes, was an
unsuccessful painter, who ran a farm on Long Island. Elizabeth
(Chappel) Barnes, Djuna's mother, was an English violinist. Djuna was
raised by her mother and her suffragist grandmother, Zadel. She and the
four other children of the family were taught outside the school
system. According to Andrew Field's biography, she could have suffered
some psychosexual abuse at home. In her works, her vision of love
contains an element of incest. On the other hand, this atmosphere of
understated perversity was typical for fin-de-siècle novels. At the age
of eighteen, Barnes was "married" in an informal ceremony to the
fifty-two-year old Perce Faulkner, the brother of Wald Barnes' mistress
Fanny Faulkner. </p>
<p>In 1911 Barnes entered at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn; she also
studied briefly at the Art Students League. After her parents divorced,
she began to work as a journalist and freelance illustrator. Barnes
lived a bohemian life in Greenwich Village and wrote for several New
York newspapers, among them the <i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>. A collection of
her interviews with sporting and artistic celebrities &#8211; such as Diamond
Jim Brady, Florenz Ziegfeld, Frank Harris, and D.W. Griffiths &#8211; was
published posthumously as <i>Interviews</i>. In New York City Patchin Place was Barnes' home at various times. </p>
<p>As a poet, Barnes made her debut in 1915 with <i>The Book of Repulsive Women</i>,
a collection of poetry and drawings. Three of her one-act plays were
produced in the 1919-20 at the Provincetown Playhouse in the Village,
where she worked with <a href="oneill.htm">Eugene O'Neill</a>. Her marriage to the editor Courtenay Lemon lasted only briefly. <br>
 </p>
<p>In 1920 Barnes left for Paris and spent the next twenty years
abroad. She first took a room at 2 rue Perronet, and after returning
from Berlin in 1922, she lived at Boulevard Saint-Germain on the Left
Bank. By the middle twenties, she had made enough money from her
writing to be able to buy an apartment on the rue Saint-Romain. Also
the English poet Mina Loy lived in the building late in the decade. <br>
</p>
      <p>Barnes interviewed expatriate writers and artists for
several magazines and became acquainted with Gertrude Stein, F. Scott
Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, and T.S. Eliot. James Joyce's experiments with
language fascinated Barnes and she declared that after <i>Ulysses</i>, it was fruitless for anyone else to try to write. Peggy Guggenheim, her patron, was one of <i>Nightwood</i>'s
dedicatees. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>It is not gentleness but mad despair </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">That sets us kissing mouths, O Khalidine, </font><br>
<font size="2">Your mouth and mine, and one sweet mouth unseen </font><br>
<font size="2">We call our soul... </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Six Songs of Khalidine', in <i>A Book</i>, 1923) </font></blockquote>
<p>Barnes' second collection of poems and drawings, <i>A Book</i>, came out in 1923. In the early 1920s, Barnes started to drink heavily. 
She had a couple nervous breakdowns and was hospitalized several times in New York. Barnes lived with the Missouri sculptor 
and silverpoint artist Thelma Wood; they parted in December 1931.  
"I am not lesbian. I only love Thelma," she once said to Ottoline Morrell (1873-1938), 
a well-known patron of the arts and friend of such writers as  T.S. Eliot, Siegfried Sassoon and
Virginia Woolf. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1928 Barnes published anonymously the <i>Ladies Almanack</i>,
an erotic pastiche of lesbian life. It was arranged by month and was
illustrated with the author's own drawings. Barnes used the style of
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries added with neologism and
Joycean wordplays. The lesbian "saint" of the story, Dame Evangeline
Musset, was allegedly modeled on the notorious Natalie Barney, who had
a literary salon in Paris. "... she had been developed in the Womb of
her most gentle Mother to be a Boy, when therefore, she came forth an
Inch or so less than this, she paid no Heed to the Error, but donning a
Vest of a superb Blister and Tooling, a Belcher for tippet and a pair
of hip-boots with a scarlet channel (for it was a most wet wading) she
took her Whip in her hand, calling her Pups about her, and so set out
upon the Road of Destiny..." Barnes' friend Robert Mc Almon had the
book printed in Paris. <i>Ladies Almanack</i> was banned by the US customs. </p>

<p>Barnes's <i>Ryder </i>(1928), a family chronicle, is more or less
autobiographical. The satirical novel, which denounced patriarchal
language and authority, imitated the style of Shakespeare, Chaucer, and
the Bible. "Let thy lips choose no prayer that is not on the lips of
thy congregation, for though it is not given to all men to pray alike,
nor blame alike, it is not shown thee to know the difference in these
matters. Therefore when thou dost ask for the mercy of God, do thou ask
it as thy neighbour seems to ask it. And when thou art pitiful, be
pitiful like thy sister and thy brother." </p>
<p><i>Nightwood</i>, Barnes' second novel and her masterpiece, was
about the doomed homosexual and heterosexual loves of five damned
characters. Barnes spent more than six years writing this work, during
which time the manuscript was turned down by a half a dozen major U.S.
publishing houses, before being accepted by Faber &amp; Faber in London
and in the United States by Harcourt Brace. In the background of the
story was the author's nine-year love affair with Thelma Wood on the
left bank artists' colony of Montparnasse. <br>
</p>
      <p>Barnes' style is poetic and
there is not much plot. A central character is Dr.&nbsp;
Matthew-Mighty-Grain-of-Salt-Dante-O'Connor, a transvestite and
raconteur, who is not a licenced practitioner and who takes the role of
poetic guide to the underworld. Barnes dedicated the book to Peggy
Guggenheim and John Ferrar Holms. T.S. Eliot wrote in his introduction
that to "say that <i>Nightwood</i> will appeal primarily to readers of
poetry does not mean that it is not a novel, but that it is so good a
novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate
it. Miss Barnes's prose has the prose rhythm that is prose style, and
the musical pattern which is not that of verse." Dylan Thomas hailed
Barnes' modernist masterpiece as "one of the three great prose books
ever written by a woman." <br>
 </p>

<p><i>Nightwood </i>is set in Paris of the inter-war period but it
starts from the year 1880 when Hedvig Volkbein &#8211; a Viennese woman &#8211;
gives birth to a child, Felix, and dies. His father, Guido Volkbein, a
Jew of Italian descent, had died earlier. Felix calls himself Baron
Volkbein, and marries Robin Vote, a young American girl. Nora Flood,
the heroine and victim of the tale, goes through her anguished lesbian
relationship with Robin. She wanders into Nora's life and out again,
and her absence becomes "an aputation that Nora could not renounce."
Robin is a shadowy figure &#8211; "I never did have a really clear idea of
her at any time," says Felix. Her destiny is to destroy those who come
close to her. "A man is another person &#8211; a woman is yourself," Nora
observes, "caught as you turn in panic; on her mouth you kiss your own.
If she is taken you cry that you have been robbed of yourself."
O'Connor, Nora's spiritual adviser and a transvestite doctor, collects
confessions of the people around him and states: "Pray to the good God;
she will keep you. Personally I call her 'she' because of the way she
made me; it somehow balances the mistake." The narrative ends with an
encounter between Nora's dog and Robin, they cry together for their
loss of Nora. "A man is whole only when he takes into account his
shadow as well as himself," Barnes wrote, reflecting <a href="cjung.htm">C.G. Jung</a>'s ideas. </p>
<p>After <i>Nightwood</i> Barnes produced only one major work, a surrealist verse play, <i>The Antiphon</i>
(1958), written in a highly artificial style. Again the subject was
incestuous family relationships; the father, Titus Higby Hobbs, who
claims to be an instrument of God, has raped his daughter, Miranda.
Also her brothers have violated her. "Slap her rump, and stand her on
four feet! / That's her best position!" says one of the brothers. At
the end Miranda is killed by Augusta, her mother, who shouts: "You are
to blame, to blame, you are to blame &#8211;". T.S. Eliot, Barnes' editor at
Faber and Faber, recommended changes to be made in the text. The play
was staged in 1962 in Stockholm, translated by Karl Ragnar Gierow and
the Swedish U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, who died in an
airplane crash in 1961. </p>
<p>In 1931 Barnes went to England, where she spent much time as the
guest of Peggy Guggenheim. At the outbreak of World War II Barnes
returned to Greenwich Village. In 1943 some of her works was exhibited
at Art of This Century. In 1961 she was elected to the National
Institute of Arts and Letters. "Growing old is just a matter of
throwing life away back; so you finally forgive even those that you
have not begun to forget." <font size="-1">(from <i>Nightwood</i>)</font>
Barnes lived out of the spotlight in her apartment on 5 Patchin Place,
until her death on June 18 (?), 1982. In spite of being a central
author of "Sapphic modernism" and feminists' interest in Barnes' work
in the 1970s and 1980s, she is still called the unknown legend of
American literature. </p>
