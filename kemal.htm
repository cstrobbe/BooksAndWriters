<p>Prolific Turkish novelist, short-story writer, and essayist, one of the last great traditional storytellers, whose novel <span style="font-style: italic;">&#304;nce Memed</span>
(1955, Memed, My Hawk) made him world famous. The book, which had
several sequels, depicts a conflict between poor tenant farmers and
rural landwoners, the Aghas. This struggle creates a young hero, a kind
of mixture of Jesse James and Che Guevara, who becomes a famous outlaw
and a legend of South Anatolia. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">People have
always created their own worlds of myths and dreams, perpetuating their
lives in those imaginary worlds. At times of duress, they have created
more such worlds, which have given them haven and facilitated their
lives. In their transition from one darkness to another, having
acquired the consciousness of death, they have realized their lives and
the joy of living in the world of myths and dreams they have created."</font></b><font size="2"> (Yashar Kemal in his </font><font size="2">acceptance speech</font><font size="2"> of the 1997 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, tr.&nbsp; Talat Salt Halman) </font></blockquote>
<p>Yasar Kemal was born Yasar Kemal Gökçeli in Adana, in autumn 1922,
into a family of well-to-do landlords. His parents came originally from
the shores of Lake Van, on the eastern frontiers of Turkey. After a
long trek on foot, they settled on the South Anatolian plain of
Cilicia, a region populated by big landowners, poor peasants, and the
Kurds. This rocky and hot landscape of the Taurus
Mountains&nbsp;served&nbsp;as the background&nbsp;for several of
Kemal's stories.&nbsp; </p><p>At the time of Yasar's birth,
his&nbsp;father Sadi Kemal was already 50, his mother Nigar was only
17. Her family descended from the Kizikan tribe.&nbsp;Nigar's brother
Mayro was a famous outlaw, who led a short but adventurous life. He was
killed when he was 25. Mayro&nbsp;provided the model&nbsp;for Kemal's
rebellious heroes. </p><p>Kemal lost his right eye early in his
childhood in a accident. When Kemal was five he saw his
father&nbsp;killed by his adoptive son Yusuf&nbsp;while praying at the
mosque.&nbsp; Due to this traumatic experience, he developed a stutter,
but&nbsp;eventually managed to&nbsp;cure himself&nbsp;by chanting folk
songs.&nbsp;To her mother's disappointment, he refused to kill Yusuf as
a revenge. <br><br>Kemal grew up in the small village of Hemite. He
started to attend a school at the age of nine in a neighborhood
village, and later went to stay with relatives who lived in Kadirli.
His first poems Kemal wrote at the age of eight. His parents spoke
Kurdish, but they had also learned to speak Turkish. The children spoke
mainly in Turkish. </p>
<p>After studying two years at a secondary school, Kemal ended his
formal education. His four sisters died and Kemal was left alone to
take care of his mother. In his teens and twenties Kemal worked in odd
jobs. He was a cottonpicker, farmhand, construction foreman, clerk,
cobbler's helper, and substitute teacher. For a period he was employed
by the city library Adana. He read voraciously, and became acquainted
with Greek classics, and Stendhal, Cervantes and Chechov. During these
years&nbsp;Kemal adopted knowledge in Turkish folklore, too. Following
the military service, he worked for a gas company. His first book,
published in 1943, was a compilation of folk elegies, which he had
collected in his region. Kemal also wrote short stories and published
poems in a local magazine in Adana and small magazines elsewhere. </p>
<p>Kemal's experiences among peasants and workers made him a devoted
defender of the underprivileged. After saving enough money, he bought a
typewriter and started to work as a public petition writer. In 1950
Kemal was arrested on charges of disseminating Communist propaganda but
he was acquitted at the trial that took place a few months later.
However, it was not the last time Kemal would be held in prison. Early
in his career he had joined the Turkish Workers' party and was
subsequently branded as a Communist he was harassed by landowners and
police. When his colleague, the famous poet <a href="hikmet.htm">Nazim Hikmet</a>,
escaped to the Soviet Union after political persecution, Kemal chose
France his second home country. Later Kemal's works were translated
into French by Hikmet's widow. In the late 1970s, the Kemals moved to
Sweden, where they spent two years. During this period he wrote The <i>Sea-Crossed Fisherman</i> (1978), <i>The Birds Have Also Gone</i> (1978), and the first part of his autobiography, <i>Kimsecik</i> (1980). All these works described Istanbul. </p>
<p>In 1952 Kemal married Thilda Serrero, they had one son. Before
settling permanently in Istanbul in 1951, Kemal had visited the city
only a few times. The first time was when he participated in a swimming
contest. His specialty was the 1500 meter freestyle. </p><p>Upon&nbsp;joining the staff of the leading Istanbul daily, <i>Cumhuriyet,</i>&nbsp;he
took the pseudonym Yasar Kemal (literally, Kemal the Survivor or Kemal
who lives).&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming&nbsp;a columnist and
special-feature writer, he worked as a roving reporter. One of his most
famous article series was about the homeless children living in the
streets of the city. </p>
<p>Kemal left <i>Cumhuriyet</i> in 1962&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> actually he was fired most probably due to his political activities <font face="Symbol">-</font> and devoted himself entirely to writing. He edited the Marxist weekly<i> Ant</i>
and was a member of the Central Committee of Turkish Labour Party. When
he was imprisoned in 1966, the British Socialist Member of Parliament
Lena Jeger pleaded for his release in the <i>Guardian</i>. Again in 1971 he was held in prison <font face="Symbol">-</font> this time twenty-six days <font face="Symbol">-</font>
for political views. His wife Thilda was in prison for a much longer
time. In 1995 Kemal was imprisoned for an article that condemned the
government's oppression of the Kurdish minority, and offered support to
the Kurdish Workers' Party. After Thilda's death in 2001, Kemal married
Ayse Semiha Baban, a lecturer at Bilgi University in Istanbul. </p>
<p>Kemal's first and best-known novel, <i>Memed my Hawk</i>, was set on the Chukurova plain, Kemal's world of drama and tales, which has been compared to <a href="faulkner.htm">William Faulkner</a>'s Yoknapatawpha County and <a href="marquez.htm">Gabriel García Márquez</a>'s
Macondo. However, Kemal can also be linked to the tradition of social
realism and its great practitioners, such as Honoré de Balzac,
Stendhal, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Sholokhov. "Traditionally and
temperamentally," Kemal has said, "I feel drawn to the art of Homer and
Cervantes." </p>

<p>The protagonist of <i>Memed my Hawk</i>, Ince Memed, runs away from
his village's tyrannical ruler Abdi Agha as a boy, but he is soon found
and beaten. On the road to escape, he coins a new name for himself,
Kara Mistik. Later in his youth he tries to escape to the
mountains with his beloved Hatche, whom the Agha has promised to his
nephew. Surrounded in their hiding place, Memed kills the nephew but
manages only to wound the landlord. He joins a group of bandits, Hatche
is imprisoned, and Memed's mother dies. Again Memed tries to kill his
archenemy who is pulling all strings to crush Memed, already a
legendary figure. After visiting the prison, where Hatche is being
held, Memed arranges her escape. She gives birth to their son, but dies
in a shooting with the police. A prisoner of his own fame, Memed is not
able to accept amnesty he has been offered, but chooses instead
revenge and disappears into tales. <br>
</p>
      <p>Although Memed,
the Anatolian Robin Hood, is the hero, the real winners
are the poor peasants, who refuse his rebellious individualism, but
learn to fight against injustice together.&nbsp; Coincidentally, this was
also the conclusion of Akira Kurosawa's famous film <i>Seven Samurai </i>(1954). However, Kemal do not end his novel with an&nbsp; uplifting message about hope.
The collective spirit of the villagers fades away when Abdi Agha turns
out to be still alive. It took Kemal 39 years to finish the story of
Memed. In the fourth volume, which came out in 1987, the hero was 25,
Kemal over 60.&nbsp; </p>

<p><i>Memed my Hawk, </i>translated into English in 1961 by Edouard Roditi, was a bestseller. From Kemal's second novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Orta Direk</span> (1963, The Wind from the Plain), the author's wife Thilda Kemal translated several of his major works into English. <i>The Wind from the Plain</i>, a story of a peasant family traveling in search of work, is considered one of Kemal's best works. <span style="font-style: italic;">Üç Anadolu Efsanesi</span> (1967) <span style="font-style: italic;">A&#287;r&#305;da&#287;&#305; Efsanesi</span> (1970, The Legend of Ararat), and <i>Binbo&#287;alar Efsanesi </i>(1971,
The Legend of the Thousand Bulls) were based on Turkey's folk-tales. In
the 1970s Kemal also wrote about the coastal towns in <span style="font-style: italic;">Al Gözüm Seyreyle Salih</span> (1976, The Saga of a Seagull), a poetic story of a boy who tries to save a seagull with a broken wing, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ku&#351;lar da Gitti</span> (1978, The Birds Have Also Gone), set in a fishing village.&nbsp; <em>Salman the Solitary</em> (1980), about rivalry and jealousy between two brothers, was based on the death of Kemal's father. </p>
<p>Kemal's several awards include the Varlik Prize (1956), the Ilhan
Iskender Award (1966), the Internatonal Theatre Festival price (1966),
the Madarali award (1973), the Foreign book proze (1979), Cono del Duca
prize (1982), the Sedet Simavi Foundation award (1985), and the Peace
Prize of the German Book Trade (1997). After his colleague <a href="pamuk.htm">Orhan Pamuk</a>
won the Nobel Prize in literature in 2006, Kemal sent his
congratulations, saying, "I'm so happy that you got the award that you
had deserved. I believe that you will write new novels with the same
passion." </p>
