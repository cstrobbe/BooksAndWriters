<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American anthropologist, author, lecturer,
one of the most influential female thinkers in the social sciences.
Margaret Mead was a celebrity as well as an intellectual, who wrote
academic and popular books. However, some
doubts have arisen about her famous <span style="font-style: italic;">Coming
in Age in Samoa</span> (1928),
but otherwise Mead is respected as a major scientist in anthropology.
Her other works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Male and
Female&nbsp;</span> (1949), <span style="font-style: italic;">An
Anthropologist at Work&nbsp;</span> (1959), a study of her colleague
Ruth Benedict, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Rap on Race</span>
(1971) with <a href="/jbaldwin.htm">James Baldwin</a>, and memoirs<span style="font-style: italic;"> Blackberry Winter</span> (1972). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As the traveler who has once been
from home is wiser than he who has never left his own doorstep, so a
knowledge of one other culture should sharpen our ability to scrutinize
more steadily, to appreciate more lovingly, our own." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Coming of Age in Samoa</font></i><font size="2">, 1928) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Margaret
Mead was born in Philadelphia into a Quaker family.
The family tradition was strong in the social sciences. Her father,
Edward Sherwood Mead, was a professor of economics at the University of
Pennsylvania, and mother, Emily (Fogg) Mead, a sociologist. In her
early childhood, before she knew what the words meant, Mead learned to
say, "My father majored in economics and minored in sociology and my
mother majored in sociology ad minored in economics." In 1919 she
entered DePauw University but transferred after a year to Barnard
College, where she took a course in anthropology with Professor Franz
Boas (1858-1942) and his assistant, Dr. Ruth Benedict; she was fifteen
years older and a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at Columbia
University.</p>
      <p>According
to Margaret Caffey's biography about Ruth Benedict,
Mead became eventually Benedict's intimate friend. They met in Rome in
1926 after Mead returned to Europe from her first fieldwork trip in
Samoa. Benedict was five feet eight inches tall, had a large and
athletic body. At that time her hair was cut shor; she resembled an
Amazon. Mead was feminine in appearance. "I never played the male role
in any relationship," she once said. <br>
</p>
      <p>Mead's first marriage
with Luther S. Cressman, a minister and archaeologist, ended in 1928.
In the same year she married Dr. Reo F. Fortune, a New Zealand
anthropologist, with whom she published <span style="font-style: italic;">Growing Up in New Guinea</span> (1930). It
compared observations of Pacific Island life with contemporary American
educational system. Without accepting promiscuity Mead suggested that
in modern society sex attitudes might be more relaxed. </p>

      <p>Mead received her Ph.D. in 1929 from Columbia University. She
carried out a number of field studies in the Pacific. Edward Mead once
had said her, "It's a pity you aren't a boy; you'd have gone far." Her
first field trip Mead made in 1925-26 to the island of Tau, in Samoa.
There she studied the development of girls in that society, and
published the results in <i>Coming of Age in Samoa</i>. In the study
she investigated adolescence lovemaking, and demonstrated that the
transition of Samoan young girls into adult women went apparently
without emotional crises. The result was contrasted with that of
American girls. Mead suggested, that Americans could learn things from
the Samoans about rising children. An Australian researcher,
Derek Freeman, claimed in his book <i>Margaret Mead and Samoa</i>
(1983), that she had ignored biological factors in favor of a theory of
cultural determination of sex roles. Jane Howard in her biography of
Margaret Mead (1984) tells that she characterized the men of the
Arapesh people of New Guinea as gentle and unaggressive while her
co-worker Reo F. Fortune recorded that many old men "claimed one or
more war homicides to his credit." </p>
      <p>On her other expeditions Mead made field studies in the
Admiralty Islands, New Guinea, and Bali. From 1926 Mead held a position
at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. She remained a
member of the staff for the rest of her career, retiring as a curator
emeritus of ethnology in 1969. Mead was a visiting lecturer at Vassar
College (1939-41), a lecturer at Columbia University (1947-51), and
from 1954 to 1978 she was an adjunct professor of anthropology at
Columbia. From 1969 to 1971 Mead served as a professor of anthropology and a
chairman of the Division of Social Sciences at Fordham University. She
also held a number of visiting professorships. At the age of 72, she
was elected to the presidency of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. </p>
      <p>In 1936 Mead went with her third husband, the English
anthropologist Gregory Bateson, to Bali to do field work. After about
fifteen years, they divorced, but the period was probably the richest
in her life. "American women are good mothers," she once said, "but
they make poor wives; Americans are very poor at being attentive to
anybody else." In their Bali years they took and annotated 25,000
photographs. Catherine Bateson, their daughter and only child, born in
1939, become the target of her parent's enthusiastic observations &#8211; her
birth was filmed and her childhood was scrupulously recorded. <span style="font-style: italic;">Balinese Character </span>appeared in
1942 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Growth and Culture</span>,
written with the collaboration of Frances Cooke Macgregor, in 1951. </p>
      
      <p>During World War II Mead served as an executive secretary of
the committee on food habits of the National Research Council. She
wrote pamphlets for the Office of War Information. After the war Mead
published <i>Male and Female: A Study of the Sexes in a Changing World</i>,
which made use of her observations of people in the South Pacific and
the East Indies. "We know of no culture that has said, articulately,
that there is no difference between men and women except in the way
they contribute to the creation of the next generation." <font size="2">(from
      <i>Male and Female</i>, 1948) </font>Partly Mead wanted to prove
that although there are certain differences between sexes &#8211; connected
with impregnation, giving birth and nursing &#8211; they shouldn't be
considered restrictions. In the last chapter Mead defended women's
right to develop their talents. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Mead also tentatively presented the
supposition that men have a subtle superiority in natural sciences,
mathematics, and instrumental music compared to women, who are more
skillful in humanities in which they can use intuition. <span style="font-style: italic;">Themes in French Culture</span> (1954) was
an attempt to apply anthropological mythology to the study of Western
society. It was written with Rhoda Budendey Métraux, a younger
colleague with whom Mead shared a house in Greenwich Village for many
years. </p>

      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">Mead's
anthropology had many other red, white and blue- blooded virtues. One
was the common anthropological conceit, out of which she made a career,
to the effect that the ultimate value of studying other cultures was
the use we could make of them to reconstruct our own </font></b><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><b><font size="2"><font size="-1"> </font>a heady kind of
intellectual imperialism, as if the final meaning of others' lives was
their significance for us."</font></b><font size="2"> (</font><font size="2">Marshall Sahlins in </font><i><font size="2">The New York
Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">August 26,
1984) </font></blockquote>
      <p>With
her publications, lectures on women's rights, child
rearing and education and other social issues Mead became something of
a guru, a larger than life character, who, in spite of her
5-foot-2-inch figure, was always the center of attention wherever she
went. Noteworthy, before Mildred Crary initiated a serious campaign to
launch Mead as a presidential candidate, David Cort wrote in 1963 a
satirical article&nbsp; or <span style="font-style: italic;">Monocle</span>,
titled 'Margaret Mead for President,' in which he put words in Mead's
mouth as to her assessment of the childhood experiences of the various
potential Republican candidates from Richard Nixon to Nelson
Rockefeller. Mead&nbsp; never had high hopes for the candidacy because
she had been married and divorced three times. The FBI kept a file on
Mead. Some of her anthropological colleagues were subjected&nbsp; to
intensive interrogation from the FBI. In the article 'What Makes the
Soviet Character' (Natural History, 1951) Mead argued that "If a
hundred Russian babies chosen at random were exchanged for a hundred
American babies chosen at random, we assume that the Soviet-born babies
would grow up to be indistinguishable from other children reared in the
United States, and the American-born babies would be indistinguishable
from other Soviet-reared children." Shortly after President Kennedy
took office, he invited her to White House to discuss on the subject of
the Russian character. <br>
</p>
      <p>Among Mead's several awards is Unesco's Kalinga Prize. Its other
receivers include <a href="/bkurten.htm">Björn Kurtén</a>, George
Gamow, Fred Hoyle, Julian Huxley, Konrad Lorenz, and <a href="/brussell.htm">Bertrand Russell</a>. One of her central themes
in speeches and writings was that while cultural factors are
fundamental determinants of behavior, they are themselves open to
influences and capable of improvement. Mead's memoirs, <span style="font-style: italic;">Blackberry Winter</span>, came out in
1972. She died of cancer in New York on November 15, 1978. From her 39
books, she wrote 15 in collaboration. Mead also was Ruth Benedict's
(1887-1948) literary executor and published in 1959 an anthology, <i>An
Anthropologist at Wor</i>k, based on her colleague's letters, diaries,
and other writings. Mead's daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson Kassarjian,
became an anthropologist and dean of social sciences at Raza Shah Civar
University in Iran. Valuable first-hand information of Margaret Mead is
to be found in her work <i>With a Daughter's Eye: Letters From the
Field, 1925-1975</i> (1984). </p>
