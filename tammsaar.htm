<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Estonian writer, whose novel <em>Tõde ja õigus</em>
I-V (1926-33) is considered one of the major works of Estonian
literature. Tammsaare's social epic captured the evolution of Estonia
from tsarist province to independent state. It was based partly on the
author's own life and centered on the contrast between the urban
bourgeoisie and hard-working peasantry. The protagonist, Indrek Paas,
moves from a farm to a city, witnesses revolutionary upheavals, tries
to find peace in marriage and the bourgeois life-style, but returns
disappointed to his roots for a new start. Although a realist at heart,
Tammsaare also wrote artistic fairy tales and used allegorical fantasy
in his stories. In his popular novel <i>The Misadventures of the New Satan</i> (1939) he combined rural Estonian life with Biblical themes, mythology and folklore. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"... The very first spring, when the
prison was built, a nightingale began to sing in an alder-tree in front
of the prison-house. </font><br>
<font size="2">This was at once reported to the King by his faithful henchmen. </font><br>
<font size="2">"What is the burden of the song?" the King asked. </font><br>
<font size="2">"Love and freedom, Your Majesty," answered the henchmen, bowing to the ground. </font><br>
<font size="2">For a moment the wise King was deep in thought. They they heard him say: </font><br>
<font size="2">"Life is captivity, and it would be wrong to sing of
freedom. Life is vengeance, and it would be a crime to glorify love. I,
your king, do not know what freedom is, for I am a slave of slaves. I,
your master, do not know what love is, for I have only obligations.
Therefore, take my fiercest falcon and set it on the nightingale." </font><br>
</b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Miniatures</font></i><font size="2">, 1977) </font></blockquote>
<p>Anton Tammsaare was born in Albu, the son of a farmer. His father,
Peeter Hansen, bought on hire purchase a stony and swampy farm, and
decided to make it prosper, in spite of an ongoing quarrel with his
neighbor, Jakob Sikenberg. Tammsaare came from a poor background, but
he managed to collect enough money for his education in Tartu with the
help of his family and by working in different jobs. </p><p>In 1903 Tammsaare graduated from high school and published his first book, <span class="ft"><em>Vanad ja noored</em></span>.
After working as a journalist in Tallinn with such cultural and
political figures as K. Päts, M. Martna, Eduard Vilder and H.
Pöögelman, he entered the University of Tartu, where he studied law.
Tammsaare's studies were interrupted by tuberculosis in 1911. He spent
over a year in a sanatorium in the Caucasus&nbsp;&#8211; his only journey
abroad&nbsp;&#8211; and the following six years in his brother's farm in
Koitjärve, reading works of Cervantes, Shakespeare and Homer. From
Koitjärve he found the name vargamäe, central in his novel <i>Tõde ja õigus</i>.</p>
<p>In 1918, when Estonia became independent, Tammsaare had moved to
Tallinn. He lived the next 20 years with his family in a house situated
between Köhler Street and Koidula Street. Käthe Weltman, whom he
married, was a determined woman. She, before the writer knew about it,
had announced their marriage in a newspaper advertisement. In Tallinn
Tammsaare wrote the works which have gained a permanent place in
Estonian literature. Although he took his subjects from the history and
life of the Estonian people, his novels have deep connections with the
ideas of Henri Bergson, Jung and Freud, and such writers as Knut
Hamsun, André Gide, D.H. Lawrence and <a href="fesillan.htm">F.E. Sillanpää</a>. </p>
<p>Tammsaare's early works are characterized by rural "poetic" realism.
He continued the literary tradition of Vilde and Kitzberg, but he was
interested as well in the psychology of his characters. Some of his
stories also reflected the atmosphere of the revolutionary year of
1905. During his second period from 1908 to 1919 he wrote several short
urban novels and collections of miniatures. In <em>Poiss ja liblik</em> (1915, The Boy and the Butterfly) Tammsaare was clearly influenced by Oscar Wilde.</p>

<p>Tammsaare's works from the 1920s explore moral concerns. In his drama <em>Juudit </em>(1921) the heroine kills Holofernes 
for selfish motives. Unlike the heroine in the Bible, Tammsaare's Judith hides her true motives under patriotic phrases &#8211; 
she wants to become the ancestress of a new dynasty, and kills Holofernes in revenge when the famous general rejects her.<em>&nbsp;Kõrboja peremees</em>
 (1922) was set in the rural milieu especially close to his heart. The love story of a young man 
from the country and an educated young woman ends tragically. </p>

<p>According to Tammsaare, the first volume of <i>Tõde ja õigus</i> (truth and justice) depicts man's 
struggle with the earth, the second with God, the third with society, the fourth with himself &#8211; the fifth ends with 
resignation. Tammsaare's view was skeptical, in general he saw things as a natural scientist would, his approach 
being biological rather than psychological. Although the work was deeply rooted in Estonian life, it dealt with 
many contemporary literary and philosophical issues. With<i> Tõde ja õigus </i>Tammsaare gained a reputation 
as one of the most original thinkers and novelists in northern Europe. The last two volumes especially contained more 
reasoning on the struggle for truth and justice than autobiographical material. </p>
<p>In <i>Tõde ja õigus</i> Tammsaare draws an ironic portrait of urban intellectuals who have absorbed bourgeois 
mores and abandoned their moral principles. The novel was written in a time which saw the rise of dictators &#8211; Hitler, Stalin, 
Mussolini&nbsp;&#8211; and the decline of truth and justice. Indrek, the protagonist, is not a man of action, but through his 
life story Tammsaare examines the same humanistic ideals of the early 20th century as Romain Roland, Thomas Mann and 
John Galsworthy do in their works. In the first part Indrek is actually a minor character, while the protagonist is his 
father, Andres Paas wiht his first wife Krõõt, who dies after giving birth to their first son. Anders, who 
wants to defend what he considers right, eventually loses his vision of right and wrong, and manages to cheat his 
archenemy, Pearu. </p><p>In the second part Indrek enters a private school in a town, actually Tartu, although Tammsaare 
doesn't mention its name. Indrek falls in love with Ramilda, the daughter of the school director. She dies of 
tuberculosis and Indrek is expelled from the school after writing an atheistic article. In the third part Indrek 
participates in the revolutionary events of 1905 but is terrified by its frenzy. The fourth part is set in 
independent Estonia. Indrek has married Karin; they have two children. After he finds out that Karin has 
been unfaithful, he nearly kills her. Indrek is released on probation. Karin dies in a traffic accident. 
In the fifth part Indrek returns to his native village. </p>
<p>In the 1930s Tammsaare published such neo-realistic novels as <em>Elu ja armastus</em> (1934) and&nbsp;<span class="ft"><em>Ma armastasin sakslast</em> </span>(1935). The play <em>Kuningal on külm</em> (1936) was about an old king who suffered from cold, and warned, in the form of a 
religious idol (a double-headed calf ), of the threats posed by anti-democratic movements. His last and most widely 
read work was<em> Põrgupõhja uus vanapagan</em> (1939, The Misadventures of the New Satan), a satirical novel about 
the Satan who becomes a farmer to win a bet with St. Peter. But even with his superhuman physical strength the Satan 
has problems with a world full of demagogy and hypocrisy. </p>
<blockquote><p><font size="2"><strong>"The Satan started to leave, but then he turned, looked at his friend St. Peter 
and said sadly:&nbsp;<br></strong>&#8211;</font><font size="2"><strong>&nbsp;I feel that I have lived in vain on the earth.&nbsp;</strong></font><br>
<font size="2">&#8211; <strong>But now you have at least hope." </strong></font><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Misadventures of the New Satan</font></i><font size="2">, 1939) </font></p></blockquote>
<p>Tammsaare was able to read in six foreign languages; Shakespeare and
Goethe in particular influenced him deeply. He also translated works
from writers such as Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy,
Joseph Conrad. In addition to his work as a novelist, he was for many
decades a prolific publicist and essayist. Tammsaare died on March 1,
1940, in Tallinn. Although he was celebrated as a national writer,
Tammsaare avoided all publicity, and when his 50th birthday was
celebrated at the Estonia theatre, Tammsaare never appeared on the
scene. </p>
