      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Controversial Zimbabwean novelist,
poet,
dramatist, and short-story writer. Marechera's works are highly
autobiographical, dealing with rootless characters struggling against
poverty, abuse, and oppression. The author died at the age of
thirty-five, and left behind a large number of unpublished literary
works. Turning his back to the traditions of realism, Marechera sought
to express subjective visions with fragmented language, without linear
or chronological order. In Zimbabwe, his style was labelled as "alien
to Africa". </p>

      <p>Dambudzo Marechera was born in Vengere Township ghetto, near
Rusape, into a troubled family. When Marechera was thirteen his father,
Isaac, who was a trucker, died after being struck by a passing military
car. This accident influenced had a profound impact on Marechera. For
several days he refused to speak and invented the story that his father
had been killed by "the Rhodesian Light Infantry". His mother, Masvotwa
Venezia Marechera, was a domestic, who turned to prostitution to earn
money for the family. Some years later Marechera, his mother, and his
siblings were evicted from their home. "What did it mean that father
was dead? What did it mean not to have a home?" Marechera recalled
later on. "It was the beginning of my physical and mental insecurity &#8211;
I began to stammer horribly. It was terrible. Even speech, language,
was deserting me." Marachera's brother, Michael, told in an interview
that their mother carried a family curse, and when she was forced to
pass the curse on to one of her children, she chose Dambudzo. </p>
      <p>Marechera attended various mission schools. A brilliant
student, he received scholarships to continue his education. However,
due to his independent character, Marechera had difficulties with the
educational system. He entered in 1972 the University of Rhodesia where
he studied English literature and published two small volumes of
poetry. While at the university he also lost his virginity and
contracted gonorrhea. In 1973 he was expelled with some 150 other
students as a result of protesting against racial discrimination on the
campus. Marechera had also conducted a solo protest march against the
government of Ian Smith. Marechera fled to Botswana, and then to
England where he gained political asylum. </p>
      <p>Although Marechera's grades had been rather poor, his
professors at the University recommended his a scholarship to Oxford.
He studied from 1974 through 1976 at the New College, where he found
out, that education was not much respected. In reaction to the
indifference of his tutors, he tried to burn down the college. Because
of his anti-social behavior, Marechera was given the option of either
submitting to voluntary psychiatric treatment or being expelled. He
chose to withdraw, and face the life which led to poverty and several
charges for petty crimes. </p>
      <p>Marechera's early experiences in the ghetto, the struggle to
survive, gangs, and the abuse of white schoolboys, established the
nihilistic basis for his fiction. While at Oxford, Marechera wrote his
first book of short stories, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
House of Hunger</span>. It was published by
Heinemann in 1978 in the African Writers Series (AWS), after Marechera
had spent two rootless years in London, hanging out with Rastafarians,
sometimes living on the streets, and writing. On the previous year
Marechera had narrowly escaped deportation with the help of James
Currey, editor in charge of the AWS. Marechera had been charged with
theft and jailed for three months for illegal possession of marijuana.
"Yes, I am in a mess and need friends quickly," he said to Currey. "And
perhaps tobacco and a more competent solicitor." Possibly also his
interest in the German the German Baader-Meinhof Group contributed to
his being regarded as a suspicious person. When he went together with
Currey but without travel documents to West Berlin, to attend a
cultural festival, he was given standing ovations by the audience. </p>
      <p>The vividly written autobiographical work focused primarily on
a black township. In the title novel the protagonist tries hopelessly
avoid oncoming destruction. "The Slow Sound of His Feet" was a
dreamlike exploration of stuttering and incest. <i>The House of Hunger</i>
was awarded the Guardian fiction prize in 1979. At the prize ceremony
at the Theatre Royal he displayed his gratitude by tossing saucers at
the chandeliers and a chair across the room, apparently aimed at the
literary editor of the newspaper. </p>
      <p>Marechera briefly became a writer-in-residence at the
University of Sheffield. He wrote articles, stories, and reviews, and
received writing grants from the Arts Council. In 1980 Marechera
published <span style="font-style: italic;">Black Sunlight</span>,
which was initially banned in Zimbabwe for
obscenity and blasphemy. However, the ban was lifted after an appeal.
Marechera's surrealistic, unstructured, nihilistic book drew parallels
between the political transformation in Zimbabwe and the transformation
of the self. Marechera's analysis of the independence process was
satirical: his characters eventually are destroyed in their fight.
Explaining once the absence of chronological order in his works,
Marechera said that history is rather "a psychological condition in
which our senses are constantly bombarded by unresolved or provisional
images." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"For a black writer, the language
is very racist; you have to have harrowing fights and hair-rising panga
duels with the language before you can make it do all that you want it
to do..." </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Marechera returned to the newly-liberated Zimbabwe in 1982,
after eight years in exile, but he become soon disgusted with the
condition of the country. In the long poem, 'Throne of Bayonets',
written shortly after his return, Machera embraced his outsiderness and
his role as a social outcast: "Wandering thro' the chartered streets of
Harare / Deaf to the prostitute's pitiful shrieks / Blind to
malnutrition's glazed look; / Finding in the blackrain no shelter / but
plain dull resignation: / "A process / of positive / Affirmation.""
Machera helped Christ Austin's filming of <i>The House of Hunger</i>,
but left the project. His third book,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Mindblast; or, The Definitive Buddy</span>,
came out in 1984. It
was the last to be published during his lifetime and expressed his
disillusionment with Mugabe's government. Marechera was arrested the
very day his book appeared and held in a police cell for six days by
the Central Intelligence Organization. <i>Mindblast</i> consisted of
three plays, two stories, some poetry, and a memoir of the author's
attempt to get together another book. Marechera spent his final years
with friends, often dead drunk, sleeping on their floors, and wandering
on the streets. An army colonel attacked him in a men's toilet.
Considerable periods of time he camped out in Harare's Cecil Square. In
1982 he was invited to a writer's festival in Berlin, and was jailed
for nine hours because he did not have a passport. He was fired from a
teaching job at People's College, and in 1984 he was arrested during
the Zimbabwe Book Fair. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"My whole life has been an attempt
to make myself a skeleton in my own cupboard." </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Marechera died of an AIDS-related pulmonary disorder on August
18, 1987. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Black Insider</span>,
which had themes similar to <i>Black
Sunlight</i>, was published posthumously in 1990. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cemetery of Mind</span>, the
first comprehensive collection of Marechera's poems, appeared in 1994.
Of Marechera's position in Zimbabwean literature, the first minister of
education after independence, Dzingai Mutumbuka, once said: "His work
gives illuminating insights into the struggle for sanity in a situation
full of contradictions, where there was a severe dislocation of moral
and social norms which, for the young academic, resulted in the
fragmentation of family and community life and of ideals and visions,
or to quote T.S. Eliot in The Wasteland, "A heap of broken images."" </p>
