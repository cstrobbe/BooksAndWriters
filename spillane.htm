<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>


<p>American thriller writer, master of "hard boiled" style peppered
with sex and sadism. Spillane is best-known for his private detective
Mike Hammer,
who appeared in his first published book <span style="font-style: italic;">I, the Jury</span>
(1947). The hardback edition did not sell well, but the paperback
became a world-wide phenomenon. In the character of Hammer, the most
chauvinist avenger among classical private eyes, Spillane created a
dark counterpart to the knightly Philip Marlowe. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The biggest part of the joke is the
punch line, so the biggest part of a book should be the punch line, the
ending. People don't read a book to get to the middle, they read a book
to get to the end and hope that the ending justifies all the time they
spent reading it. So what I do is, I get my ending and, knowing what my
ending is going to be, then I write to the end and have the fun of
knowing where I'm going but not how I'm going to get there."</b> (Spillane in </font><i><font size="2">Speaking of Murder</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Ed Gorman and Martin H. Greenberg, 1998) </font></blockquote>

<p>Frank Morrison Spillane was born in Brooklyn, New York, the only child of John J. Spillane, 
a bartender, and Catherine A Spillane. Noteworthy, in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Twisted Thing</span>
(1966) Mike Hammer mentions his father; he was the one who comforted
him when he hurt himself. In his youth Spillane read such writers as
Alexandre Dumas and Anthony Hope, and was also fascinated by comic
books. He graduated in 1935 from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn,
and then attended briefly Fort Hays State College in Kansas, but
dropped out, and moved back to New York. Spillane worked as a
lifegueard at Breezt Point, Queens, and in the 1940s he sold ties at
Gimbles department stores. </p>
<p>Spillane began his writing career in the mid-1930s. His first
stories were published mostly in comic books and pulp magazines. He
developed Mike Danger, a private detective, and wrote among others for <i>Captain America</i>, <i>Captain Marvel</i>, and <i>The Human Torch</i>.
During WW II Spillane served as a flying instructor for the U.S. Army
Air Force in Mississippi and Florida; he never got overseas. In 1945 he
married his first wife, Mary Ann Pierce, in Greenwood, Mississippi.
They had four children. Achieving the rank of captain by the time, he
left the service, and returned in 1946 to New York. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Spillane writes with speed, and the
rough-hewn poetry of his narrator creates a fantasy city, a NewYork of
myth and dream, populated by the same character types as those found in
the work of Daly, Hammett, and Chandler - good girls, black widows,
thugs, frustrated cops, gang lords, corrupt society leaders - but
delivered with a unique fever-dream fervor."</b> (Max Allan Collins in </font><i><font size="2">Mystery &amp; Suspence Writers</font></i><font size="2">, vol. 2, ed. by Robin W. Winks, 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p><i>I, the Jury</i> was written in only nine days. When the
manuscript was passed to Editor in Chief Nicholaus Wreden at E.P.
Dutton &amp; Co., he said: "It isn't in the best of taste, but it will
sell." Spillane told that he wanted an advance of $1,000 so he could
build a four-room cinderblock house in upstate New York for himself and
his young wife. The house was later named Little Bohenia. As a Signet
paperback,<i> I, the Jury</i> 
      became such success that Spillane quickly produced six more Hammer novels, 
      five of them published between 1950 and 1952. <em>      
          
  The Long Wait<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></em> (1951)
sold 3 million copies in a single week in 1952. Spillane himself posed
for the dust wrapper photographs of Hammer novels and starred in the
film version of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Girl Hunters</span> (1962). At home he usually wore T-shirts or tight wool 
      sweaters and close-fitting blue jeans. He also refused to wear a necktie 
      and boasted in the 1950s, that he still owns only one suit. When the 
      British producer/director Victor Saville wanted to bring<em> I, the 
      Jury</em>
to the screen, Spillane insisted that they meet under the clock at
the Pennsylvania Railway Station, not in some office. From there they continued
to a bar on Third Avenue to make a deal. </p>
<p>"Crime novels are a good way to make money," Spillane once stated. However, the sixth Hammer novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Twisted Thing</span>,
did not appear until 1966. The friends of this ferocious detective
included his secretary Velda, a dark-haired beauty, who is the tough
soul mate of Mike, and Captain Pat Chambers of the New York Police
Department. In the first novel Hammer investigates the brutal murder of
his best friend. Eventually he discovers that his girl friend, the
beautiful but bad Charlotte Manning, a lady psychiatrist, is the
murderer. At the end of the story, she performs a strip tease in order
to dissuade the angry Hammer from killing her. When he shoots her,
Manning asks, "How c-could you?" and he replies, "It was easy" <font face="Symbol">-</font> one of the most famous last lines in popular fiction. </p>
<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Vengeance is Mine!</span>
(1950) Hammer is tormented by the memory of Charlotte and vows never to
kill another woman, until a murderous doppelgänger of her is revealed
to be a transvestite. The theme of crime and punishment <font face="Symbol">-</font> Hammer acting as the tool of some ancient God <font face="Symbol">-</font>
continued in the following novels. Hammer often hears noises in his
head, sometimes like the plunging pistons in a gasolinen engine, or
kettledrums, or bells. In <span style="font-style: italic;">One Lonely Night </span>(1951)
a Judge argues that Hammer enjoys killing, which makes his as bad as
those he kills. However, when it's a question of the Communist menace,
Hammer swaps his .45 for a Tommy gun. </p>
<p>A beautiful woman, Berga Torn, clad only in a trenchcoat, stops Hammer's sportscar on a lonely road in <span style="font-style: italic;">Kiss Me Deadly</span> (1952).
She has escaped from a sanitarium, where she was referred by Dr.
Soberin. However, her chasers beat Hammer, torture and kill her. Hammer
starts to investigate the case, Velda is kidnapped by the Mob but
Hammer rescues her. He finds out that Lily Carver is Soberin's mistress
and has used him to get a metal box containing $2 million in heroin.
Hammer gets his revenge &#8211; he kills her &#8211; but is left in the end in a
burning house, trying to get away from the flames. The novel started
Spillane's nine-year silence as a novelist. The hiatus ended with <span style="font-style: italic;">The Deep</span>, a story of a tough guy, who returns to his old neighborhood &#8211; revealing in the end of the story that he is a cop now.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Why should one of the most popular
authors of the twentieth century need defending? Easy, as Mike Hammer
might say: his subject matter and his approach were so hard-hitting, so
individual, that Spillane repelled the more proper and staid among the
Literary Establishment (and the Establishment in general, including Dr.
Frederic Wertham and Parents Magazine and other unpointed arbiters of
public morality.). And it has taken time, and changing mores </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><font size="2"><b>
plus the natural PR knack of Spillane himself, with such disarming
tactics as funny self-parody beer commercials and the writing of
award-winning children's books - to give him his rightful place as the
living giant among mystery writers." </b>( 'Mecca Spillane' by Max Allan Collins, in </font><i><font size="2">The Big Book of Noir</font></i><font size="2">, 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p>Spillane told once that he finishes his text in two weeks and do not
revise anything he has written. He used a standard typewriter, and
often he could go on for five or six pages without changing a single
word. "Hell, I'n not an author, I'm a writer," he said. "I've got to
make a living, somehow. I'm not writing just for fun. I'm not trying to
educate the people. I'm just trying to entertain. If they put their
money in the hat, that's all I want." Although critics tried to
belittle the author's achievements from the beginning, Spillane had
such defenders as Ayn Rand, who has said, that "Spillane gives me the
feeling of hearing a military band in a public park." To his critics
Spillane answered, "but it's good garbage." On a list complied in 1967
of all the best-selling books published in America between 1895 and
1965, seven of the top twenty-nine were written by Spillane. Especially
during the height of anti-Communist paranoia, Hammer's unyielding,
patriotic character comforted many American readers. </p>
<p>Spillane stopped writing full-length novels for many years after
conversion to the Jehovah's Witnesses in 1952, and between 1973 and
1989, when he advertised Miller Lite beer. Spillane said that he was
first attracted to the Witnesses by a member who proved him that
Darwin's theory of the Evolution was in error. In the early 1950s
Spillane became involved with a circus and did some trampoline work as
well as being shot out of a cannon. Hammer was brought back with<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Girl Hunters</span>,
in which the hero is still haunted by the memory of Charlotte. The book
was followed by four more titles. Spillane's second wife, the actress
Sherri Malinou, served as the model for several of the later Hammer
book covers. </p>
<p>Spillane's only other series character, Tiger Mann, was inspired by
James Bond boom. Mann works for an espionage organization funded by a
radical right-wing billionare. The character was first introduced in
novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Day of the Gun</span> (1964). In his longest and most ambitious novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Erection Set</span>, Spillane followed in the footsteps of Harold Robbins and <a href="iwallace.htm">Irving Wallace</a>. </p>
<p>In 1983 Spillane married Jane Rodgers Johnson, a former Miss South
Carolina, and twenty-eight years his junior. In 1995 the Mystery
Writers of America finally presented him the Grand Master award.
Spillane returned to comic books in the mid-1990s by co-creating a
futuristic Mike Danger. Although he did not do the script writing,
Spillane has completed a draft of a Mike Danger science fiction novel.
Spillane also wrote two books for children. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Day the Sea Rolled Back</span> (1979) earned him a Junior Literary Guild Award. Most of Spillane's short fiction was produced in the 1950s and published in <i>Manhunt</i> and such men's magazines as <i>Cavalier</i> and <i>Male</i>. </p>
<p>The unbeatable Hammer survived to the 1990s, outliving William Crane, Philip Marlowe, Mike Shayne, and Lew Archer. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Black Alley</span>
(1996) he wakes up from a coma and tracks down a missing $89 billion.
Times have changed, and Spillane reveals his tough-guy's fondness for
Wagner (1813-1883), the German opera composer, whose music had a strong
appeal to the Nazis. Today, however, Wagner's music is almost
unreservedly accepted without political overtones. In an interview at
the age of 83, Spillane mentioned that he still writes and has finished
a couple of adventure stories. The last novel about Hammer was under
work. Spillane died in July 2006, at the age of 88. </p>

use of the first-person style influenced Spillane. One of his most
quoted line is, "Detective Satan Hall dropped to one knee and fired
