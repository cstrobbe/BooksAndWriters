      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Italian scholar, poet,
and
humanist, a major force in the development of the Renaissance. Petrarch
is perhaps most famous for his poems addressed to Laura, an idealized
beloved whom he met in 1327 and who died in 1348. Attempts have been
made to identify her, but all that is known is that Petrarch met Laura
in Avignon, where he had entered the household of an influential
cardinal. She is generally believed to have been the 19-year-old wife
of Hugues de Sade. Petrarch saw her first time in the church of Saint
Claire. According to several modern scholars, it is possible that Laura
was a fictional character. However, she was a more realistically
presented female character than in the conventional songs of the
troubadours or in the literature of courtly love. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In my youth I was blessed with an
agile,
active body, though not particularly strong; and while I cannot boast
of being very handsome, I was good-looking enough in my younger days. I
had a clear complexion, between light and dark, lively eyes, and for
many years sharp vision, which, however, unexpectedly deserted me when
I passed my sixtieth birthday, and forced me, reluctantly, to resort to
the use of glasses. Although I had always been perfectly healthy, old
age assailed me with its usual array of discomforts." </b>(in 'Letter
to Posterity') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Francis Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca) was born in Arezzo, the
son of
a notary, but he spend his early childhood in a village near Florence.
His father, Ser Petracco, was expelled from Florence by the Black
Guelfs, who had seized power. Also <a href="dante.htm">Dante</a>, born
in Florence, became at the same year a victim of political reprisals.
Petrarch spent much of his early life at Avignon, where Pope Clement V
had moved in 1309, and in Carpentras, a little town east of Avignon. He
studied at Montpellier (1319-23) and moved to Bologna, where he studied
law in 1323-25. Petrarch was primarily interested in writing and Latin
literature, sharing this passion with his friend Giovanni Boccaccio
(1313-1375), the writer of <i>Decameron</i>.</p>
      <p>When his father died in 1326, Petrach returned to Avignon,
where he
worked in different clerical offices. The turning point in his life was
April 6 1327, when he saw Laura in the church of Sainte-Claire
d'Avignon. She became the queen of his poetry. "To be able to say how
much you love is to love but little," Petrarch wrote in 'To Laura in
Death'. Petrarch did not feel at home in Avignon but while staying
there he composed numerous sonnets which acquired popularity. </p>
      <p>As a scholar and poet, Petrarch soon grew famous, and in 1341
he was
crowned as a poet laureate in Rome. He was subsequently charged with
various diplomatic missions. The latter part of his life he spent in
wandering from city to city in northern Italy as an international
celebrity. At Vaucluse, about fifteen miles from Avignon, where he had
transferred his books, he wrote among others <em>Bucolicum Carmen</em>
(1345-47) and <em>De Vita Solitaria</em>&nbsp; (1345-47). </p>
      <p>In search for old Latin classics and manuscripts, he travelled
through France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The manuscripts he brought
to Venice, dreaming that they would one day form core of a new
Alexandrian Library, were forgotten in a damp palazzo, where they
crumbled into dust. In 1337 Petrarach visited Rome for the first time.
Disappointed, he wrote: "Where<i> </i>are the numerous constructions
erected by Agrippa, of which only the Pantheon remains? Where are the
splendorous palaces of the emperors?" The great Rome described in the
old books did not exists. After recovering from the shock, he started
see in every step "something to exite the tongue and the
intellect".&nbsp;Wandering through the ruins, Petrarch tried to
recreate the topography of the city. In spite of making mistakes in his
research,&nbsp;he is considered a&nbsp;more realiabe&nbsp;observer than
his contemporaries. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Petrarch settled about 1367 in Padua, where he passed his
remaining
years in religious exercises. He died in Arquà in the Euganean Hills on
July 18, 1374. According to Domenico Arentino, his death was occasioned
by apoplexy. He was found in his library, with his head reclining on a
book. To Boccaccio Petrarch bequeathed a small sum of money for a new
cloak. Boccaccio surved Petrarch but a year. In 1630 his monument
outside the parish church of Arquà was violated by thieves,
who&nbsp;stole some of his bones in order to sell them. </p>
      <p>Petrarch was regarded as the greatest scholar of his age, who
combined interest in classical culture and Christianity and left deep
influence
on literature throughout Western Europe. The majority of his works
Petrarch wrote in Latin, although his sonnets and canzoni&nbsp;composed
in Italy were equally influential. Petrarch was known as a devoted
student of antiquity, who had a passion for finding and commenting on
the works of the ancients. In his letter to posterity he confessed that
he always disliked his own age: "I would have preferred to have been
born in any other time than our own." But the recovery of the past
should not lead to the imitation of the style of Virgil and Cicero: "I
much prefer that my own style be my own," he said, "uncultivated and
rude, but made to fit, as a garment, to the measure of my mind, rather
than to someone else's, which may be more elegant, ambitious, and
adorned. . . ."<br>
      </p>
      <p>A prolific correspondent, he wrote many important letters, and
his
critical spirit made him a founder of Renaissance humanism. Among
Petrarch's Latin works are <em>De Virilis Illustribus</em>, a kind of
version of Plutarch's <i>Comparative Biograpies</i>, and the epic poem
      <em>Africa</em>,
which has Scipio Africanus as its hero. During the reign of Mussolini,
&nbsp;a new interest arose in the poem, when the Fascist regime began
to recreate a "Roman" Empire through the conquest of Ethiopia. Figures
like Leopardi and Petrarch were presented as prophets of&nbsp; Italian
national greatness and would-be supporters of the regime. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>The dialogue <em>Secretum</em>,
was a debate with St. Augustine. Petrarch&nbsp;ignored
Augustine's&nbsp;hostility towards&nbsp;pagan culture, in favor of his
references to classical pagan literature. Rejecting the prevailing
blind faith in&nbsp;scholastic authorities, he&nbsp;argued that one
should not "accept everything without criticism" because it is a sign
of intellectual laziness and dullness. Other noteworthy works include <em>Rerum
Memorandarum Libri</em>, an incomplete treatise on the cardinal
virtues, <em>De Remediis&nbsp;Utriusque Fortunae</em>, Petrarch's most
popular Latin prose work, <em>Itinerarium</em>, a guide book to the
Holy Land, and <em>De sui ipsius et multorum ignorantia</em>, against
Aristotelians. </p>

      <p>Petrarch wrote and revised his sonnets during the years
between 1327 and 1374. <em>Canzoniere </em>(Song
Book) was inspired by the Lady whom Petrarch names Laura, chronicling
his first encounter with her at the age of 23. Intoxicated by Laura,
Petrarch&nbsp;wrote of&nbsp;her rare beauty just like the Persian poet
and astronomer Omar Khayyám (1048–1131) wrote of wine. However, his
love was not returned –&nbsp;her presence causes him
unspeakable&nbsp;joy, and on the other hand it creates unendurable
desires. There is no definite information concerning Laura, except that
she is lovely to look at, with golden hair, and her bearing is modest
and dignified. Upon her death, the poet finds that his grief is as
difficult to live with as was his former despair. Later in 'Letter to
Posterity' Petrarch wrote: "In my younger days I struggled constantly
with an overwhelming but pure love affair&nbsp;– my only one, and I
would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but
salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames. I certainly wish I
could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the
flesh, but I would be lying if I did."</p>
