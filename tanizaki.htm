      <p>Japanese novelist, poet, and essayist, who dealt with the
influence of the West on the old cultural heritage of his native
country. After publishing novels written in a fairly orthodox style,
Tanizaki fused traditional Japanese storytelling and experimental
narrative. He emphasized the fabrication as the basis for fiction,
stating that in both his reading and his writing he was "uninterested
in anything but lies." </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2">"I read somewhere the other day
that men who are too fond of the ladies when they're young generally
turn into antique-collectors when they get old. Tea sets and paintings
take the place of sex."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Some Prefer Nettles</font></i><font size="2">, 1928) </font>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Jun'ichir&#333; Tanizaki was born in Nihombashi, in the commercial
district near Tokyo Bay. His family owned a printing press, founded by
Tanizaki's grandfather near the rice merchants' quarter. "Grandfather
was very fond of me, his last grandchild; and sometimes in later years
I suddenly felt I could hear his voice calling my name &#8211; "Jun'ichi,
Jun'ichi," as he had during my earliest years, while he was still
alive. A much-enlarged photograph of him was always prominently
displayed in our house, so I got to know his face well, and could call
it to mind and so encounter Grandfather whenever I wished." Aften
falling on hard times Tanizaki's family had lost much of its former
wealth. Tanizaki worshiped his mother who breast-fed him until he was
6. Despite financial problems, his parents pampered him and took him to
countless theatrical performances, which early gave birth to the
author's passion for drama and the traditional Japanese arts. </p>
      <p> Tanizaki's studies at the university of Tokyo ended in 1910
in shortage of money &#8211; or according to some sources his nonpayment of
fees was an act of rebellion. At the age of 24 he published one of his
best short stories, 'The Tattooer', which show influence of <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, Oscar Wilde and the French
Decadents. Wilde's <i>Portrait of Dorian Gray</i> Tanizaki also
translated. In the story the character of a young woman starts to
change when she has taken a tattoo. When in Wilde's novel the painting
displays the decay of the subject, in Tanizaki's tale the artist's
design is the cause of the woman transformation. The theme of feminine
beauty and moral integrity marked his following stories, among then
'Whirlpool' in which an evil woman poses as a Buddhist saint for an
artist's drawing. </p>
      <blockquote><font color="White" size="2"><b>--</b></font><b><font size="2">...Standing aside, he studied the enormous female spider
tattooed on the girl's back, and as he gazed it, he realized that in
this work he had expressed the essence of his whole life. Now that it
was completed, the artist was aware of a great emptiness. </font><br>
        <font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">'To give
you beauty I have poured my whole soul into this tattoo,' Seikichi
murmured. 'From now on there is not a woman in Japan to rival you!
Never again will you know fear. All men, all men will be your
victims...' </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Tattoo') </font></blockquote>
      <p>The turning point in Tanizaki's life was the great
earthquake in Tokyo region in 1923. His house in the fashionable
residential area was leveled by the quake. Tanizaki left his wife and
child and moved to the Osaka area which was much more old fashioned.
There
he stopped using Western models and started to take interest in
traditional literature, especially the classical Japanese tale <span style="font-style: italic;">Genji monogatari </span>(The Tale of
Genji), which was written by Lady Murasaki Shikibu (c. 980-1030).
Tanizaki put it into modern Japanese three times. </p>
      <p>Tanizaki's first novel from this period, serialized in the
mid-20's, was <span style="font-style: italic;">Chijin no Ai&nbsp;</span>
(1924, Naomi, translated into English in 1985), in which a 28-year-old
engineer, Joji, goes through his love affair with a very young girl,
who is totally immersed into Western culture. This masochistic story
anticipated Nabokov's <i>Lolita</i>, but it also drew on the Pygmalion
theme. "As Japan grows increasingly cosmopolitan, Japanese and
foreigners are eagerly mingling with one another; all sorts of new
doctrines and philosophies are being introduced; and both men and women
are adopting up-to-date Western fashions. No doubt, the times being
what they are, the sort of marital relationship that we've had, unheard
of until now, will begin to turn up on all sides." <font size="2">(from
      </font><i><font size="2">Naomi</font></i><font size="2">)</font>
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Tade kuu mushi</span> (Some
Prefer Nettles, 1928-29) Tanizaki continued the theme of the clash
between traditional values and modern culture and made Tokyo and Osaka
symbols of the conflict. The protagonist, Kaname, considers himself a
man of his time, but eventually abandons the modern world. </p>
      <p>At the time of writing 'Professor Rado' (1925-28), an erotic
story about an eccentric bachelor professor, Tanizaki's second marriage
was ending. Her third wife, Matsuko, become again for the author a
target of worship, as many other women in his life. </p>
      <p>Tanizaki's years of immersion in Japanese history produced
some of his finest works. <i>The Secret History of the Lord of Musashi
      </i>(1935) was set in the the 16th-century civil-war period. In
the story Lady Kikyo set out to revenge the murder of her father and
mutilation of his face. But the culprit is not her won husband, as she
thinks, but her lover, the Lord of Mushashi, whose bizarre sexual
obsession is behind the whole plot. Tanizaki's admiration for old Osaka
is seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sasameyuki</span> (The
Makioka Sisters, 1943-48), a recreation of Osaka family life in the
1930s. The first chapters of the novel appeared during the World War
II, but further publication was stopped by censorship of the military
government. Tanizaki continued writing and published the first part at
his own expense and delivered the copies to his friends. The second
part appeared in 1947 and the third part was first printed in a
serialized form in a magazine. </p>
      <p>Although Tanizaki's used his own wife and her three
sisters-in-law as models &#8211; and the author himself plays a small part in
the middle of the story &#8211; it is not a <i>roman à clef. </i>Tanizaki
wanted to record the vanishing cultural milieu of Osaka, its dialect,
and the daily life of a middle-class family. The story is about four
sisters, who are trying to find a suitable husband for Yukiko, the
third sister. She is a woman of traditional belief and has rejected
several suitors, and remains almost unmarried. Until Yukiko marries,
Taeko, the youngest, the most Westernized, must wait for her turn
according to the social convention. </p>
      <p>His nostalgic love for the traditions and remnants of the
past, even rustic and worn-out, Tanizaki expressed in the essay 'In
Praise of Shadows' (1933-34), first published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Keizai &#333;rai</span>,
a general-interest magazine. Tanizaki juxtaposed Western harsh
clinical light and opaqueness and the ''muddy'' Japanese complexion:
''I would call back at
least for literature this world of shadows we are losing. In the
mansion called literature I would have the eaves deep and the walls
dark, I would push back into the shadows the things that come forward
too clearly, I would strip away the useless decoration.'' Even the
comforts of moders flush toilets do not have appeal to Tanizaki; the
traditional Japanese toilet "is the perfect place to listen to the
chirping of insects or the song of the birds, to view the moon, or to
enjoy any of those poignant moments that mark the change of the
seasons." <br>
 </p>
      <p>Tanizaki's characters are often driven by obsessive erotic
desires. His famous post-war novels include <span style="font-style: italic;">Futen rojin nikki </span>(1962, Diary of
a Mad Old Man), which depicts an aged diarist who is struck down by a
stroke caused by an excess of sexual excitement. He records both his
past desires and his current efforts to bribe his daughter-in-law to
provide sexual favors in return for Western baubles.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Kagi</span> (1956, The Key) was a story
of dying marriage examined through parallel diaries. "If now, for the
first time, my diary becomes chiefly concerned with our sexual life,
will she be able to resist the temptation? By nature she is furtive,
fond of secrets, constantly holding back and pretending ignorance;
worst of all, she regards that as feminine modesty. Even though I have
several hiding places for the key to the locked drawer where I keep
this book, such a woman may well have searched out all of them." The
two protagonists start to use their diaries as a means of communication
by tacitly agreeing to read each other's diaries while outwardly
pretending that they do not. The diaries reveal their problems of
understanding each other and separateness even during the shared
activity of sexual union. <i>The Key </i>was adapted into screen by
Kon Ichikawa in 1959, and later by Tinto Brass.</p>
      <p> Tanizaki was one of Japan's first crime writers. In the short
story 'The Thief' Tanizaki again studied the theme of fabrications and
the truth. The narrator is a young student who is suspected of stealing
from his comrades. "It also struck me that if even the most virtuous
person has criminal tendencies, maybe I wasn't the only one who
imagined the possibility of being a thief." Finally the protagonist
admits his guilt but defends himself that he told the truth in a
roundabout way. </p>
      <p> Several of his stories have been made into films, in Japan
and in other countries. For <i>The Makioka Sisters</i> he received the
Imperial Prize in 1949. His later years Tanizaki lived his mostly in
the Kansai, the area around Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe. Mishima Yukio, from the
younger generation of writers, was an ardent admirer of Tanizaki; they
both were committed aesthetes. Tanizaki died in Yugawara, south of
Tokyo, on July 30, 1965. His childhood memoirs appeared serially in a
Japanese magazine in 1955-56, and were published in English in 1988. </p>
