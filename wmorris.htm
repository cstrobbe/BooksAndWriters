<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English craftsman, poet, and early
socialist,
whose designs generated the Arts and Crafts Movement in the later half
of the1900th century. William Morris encouraged to return to handmade objects
and rejected standard tastes. He was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood and a close friend of the painter-poet <a href="dgrosset.htm">Dante
Gabriel Rossetti</a> and his sister <a href="rossetti.htm">Christina Rossetti</a>,
also a poet. Morris's achievement as a designer has somewhat
overshadowed his other achievements as a writer and socialist
visionary. <br>
</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"If you want a golden rule that will fit
everybody, this is it: Have nothing in your houses that you do not know
to be useful, or believe tom be beautiful."</b> (from 'The Beauty of Life', 1880) </font></blockquote>
<p>William Morris was born in Walthamstow, Greater London, the son of
William Morris, a successful city broker, and Emma Shelton Morris. His
father died young, but his shares in a Devon copper mine keep the
family financially secure. Not having to worry about money was
significant factor that contributed to Morris's casual attitude toward
class distinctions and his own background: "I am a boor and the son of
a boor," he wrote once to a friend. <br>
</p>
      <p>Morris's early childhood near Epping Forest, where he grew up,
was idyllic. He attended Marlborough College in 1848-51, recalling
later that "I think I may fairly say I learned next to nothing there,
for indeed next to nothing was taught". In 1853 he entered Exeter
College, Oxford, where he met Edward Burne-Jones and Charles Faulkner.For a while  Morris toyed with the
idea of taking Holy Orders, but the emotional lure of High Alglicanism
soon faded and he became questionable in doctrinal points. Moreover,
the work of John Ruskin converted him to architecture. After taking his
B.A. in 1856, Morris began to study architecture but he then decided
that his real calling was painting, before poetry took him over.
Morris's early poems were published in <i>The Oxford and 
Cambridge Magazine</i>
&#8211; he also financed the publication. In 1858 Morris worked with
Rossetti, Burne-Jones, and others on the frescoes in the Oxford Union. <br>
      </p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;"> The Defence of Guenevere and other Poems</span>
(1858) contained much of Morris's
best work, including 'The Haystack in the Floods,' 'Concerning Geffray
Teste Noire,' 'Shameful Death' and 'Golden Wings.' They all have
medieval settings &#8211; Morris was obsessed with medieval world. In the
prose fantasy 'The Hollow Land' (1856) an unjust knight enters an
eartly paradise. He departs it, becomes aged, and finally regains the
land through devotion to pictorial art. G.K. Chesterton once remarked
that "If his poems were too like wallpapers, it was because he really
could make wallpapers." <br>
 </p>

<p>In 1859 Morris married Jane Burden and worked as a professional
painter (1857-62). Their home, Red House at Bexley, was designed by
Philip Webb. It was an important landmark in domestic architecture.
Literary fame Morris gained with the romantic narrative <span style="font-style: italic;">The Life and Death of Jason</span>, which came out in 1867, and was based on the story of Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">The Earthy Paradise</span> (1868-70), a kind of re-reading of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Canterbury Tales</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Books of Verse</span> (1870). <span style="font-style: italic;">The Earthy Paradise</span>
became a highly popular. Though Morris was passionate about his work,
he did not take himself too seriously. "If a chap can't compose an epic
poem while he is weaving a tapestry, he had better shut up," he once
said. When Lord Alfred Tennyson died in 1892, Morris was offered the
Poet Laureateship. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p>Morris's visits in Iceland in the 1870s inspired <i>The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Nibelungs</i>
(1876), which is regarded his principal poetic achievement. This period
in Morris's life was marked by marriage problems &#8211; his wife had two long
affairs, one with Rossetti and the other with poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt; Morris was involved with Georgiana Burne-Jones. <font size="-1"></font><br>
 </p>

<p>In the 1860s Morris started revolutionize the art of house
decoration and furniture in England after founding the firm of Morris,
Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. The firm first specialized in providing
stained glass and fittings for churches, but gradually won a cliente
for domestic wares. Morris himself was an energetic craftsman, who
learned to dye for himself, when he decided that the firm should turn
to printing of textiles. His "Daisy" wallpaper, designed in 1862,
became famous &#8211; his wallpapers have never gone out of fashion. Other
sought-after products were tapestries, carpets, stained glass and
stencilled mural decorations etc. "I do not want art for a few, any
more than I want education for a few, or freedom for a few," he once
said. In 1877 he founded the Society for the protection of Ancient
Buildings in protest against the destruction being caused by the
restorers. </p>
<p>Morris defined art as "the expression by man of his pleasure in 
labor."<b> </b>In the Middle Ages art, according to him, artist were plain 
workmen. The things which are today's museum pieces, where common things earlier. 
Art should become this again: "a happiness for the maker and the user." 
Morris derived his art theories partly from Ruskin, who hated contemporary style and 
has said that a railway station could never be architecture. Ruskin advocated free 
schools, free libraries, town planning, smokeless zones, and green belts &#8211; ideas that presupposed social reforms. </p>

<p>The Morris family moved into Kelmscott House at Hammersmith in 1878.
In 1883 he joined the Social Democratic Federation and subsequently
organized the Socialist League, with its own publication,<i> The Commonweal.</i> In 1887 he and George Bernard Shaw led a political demonstration in London. Morris was well known for his temper. When in a rage, he could crush
forks with his teeth and smash holes in plaster walls with his head. <font size="-1">(from 'Idle Idol: William Morris. John Mitchinson celebrates a revolutionary life', <span style="font-style: italic;">The Idler</span>, Issue 41, Summer 2008). </font> </p>
<p>Morris's love for old handsome books and illuminated manuscripts resulted in the 
founding of the Kelmscott Press. It produced from 1891 to 1898 53 titles in 66 volumes, 
among others <i>The Works of <a href="chaucer.htm">Geoffrey Chaucer</a></i>. He also 
designed three typestyles for his press, and translated <a href="virgil.htm">Virgil</a>'s 
<i>Aeneid</i> (1875), <i>Odyssey</i> (1887), and <i>Beowulf</i> (1895). <br>
</p>
      <p>Both <a href="cslewis.htm">C.S. Lewis</a> and<a href="tolkien.htm"> J.R.R. Tolkien</a> have cited Morris's prose romances as inspirational for their own work. <i>The Well at the World's End </i>(1896) was a forerunner of Tolkien's<a href="tolkien.htm"> </a>kind of secondary word fantasy literature. 
The protagonist is Ralph who drinks from the youth-giving and life-prolonging well. 
The utopian romances <i>A Dream of John Ball</i> (1888) and <i>News from Nowhere</i> (1891) 
were first published in serial form in <i>The Commonweal</i>, the newspaper of the 
Socialist League. Both were cast in a dream setting. Erich S. Rabkin dismissed <i>News from 
Nowhere</i> as "a Communist tract" but C.S. Lewis praised Morris's style and 
language. "No mountains in literature are as far away as distant mountains 
in Morris," he wrote about the author's fantasies.  </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The Kelmscott Press reduced the matter
to an absurdity &#8211; as seen from the point of view of brute
serviceability alone &#8211; by issuing books for modern use, edited with the
obsolete spelling, printed in black-letter, and bound in limp vellum
fitted with thongs. As a further characteristic feature which fixes the
economic place of artistic book-making, there is the fact that these
elegant books are, at their best, printed in limited editions. A
limited edition is in effect a guarantee &#8211; somewhat crude, it is true &#8211;
that this book is scarce and that it therefore is costly and lends
pecuniary distinction to its consumer."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Theory of the Leisure Class</font></i><font size="2"> by Thorstein Veblen, 1953, originally published 1899) </font></blockquote>
<p>The narrator of <i>News from Nowhere</i>, William Guest, 
wakes up  in twenty-first-century London, in a radically changed society. The 
socialist revolution has abolished capitalism, money does not play any role in the 
bucolic harmony, there are no factories or industrial waste in the word of artisans, 
which evokes the spirit of the Middle Ages. Because the whole people is the parliament, 
the Houses of Parliament have lost their former function, and they been turned 
into a dung-market. Like Thoreau in <i>Walden, or a Life in the Woods</i> (1854), Morris 
rejects mass society and argues for the ideal of the simple life. </p>
<p>On his death, Morris was widely mourned as "our best man" by his
fellow socialists. His final words were: "I want to get mumbo jumbo out
of the world." Morris's view that the true stimulation to useful labor
must be found in the work itself is still relevant. His designs brought
about a complete revolution in public taste, though he was aware that
only the rich could afford the products of his firm. </p>
