      <p>
Italian poet, novelist and dramatist, military hero, and supporter
fascist political ideas. D'Annunzio combined in his work naturalism,
symbolism, and erotic images, becoming the best interpreter of European
Decadence in post-Risorgimento Italy. His love affairs, relationship
with the world-famous actress Eleanora Duse, heroic adventures during
World War I, and his occupation of Fiume in 1919 made him a legend in
his own time. </p>

      <p>Gabriele D`Annunzio was born in Pescara (Abruzzi), in Central
Italy on the Adriatic coast. This environment provided him with
inspiration for many his books. "On the soles of my shoes, the heels of
my boots I carry the earth of Abruzzi, the mud of my estuary,"
D'Annunzion later said. His father was a wealthy landowner, dealer in
wine and agricultural products, and later mayor of the town &#8211;
originally his name was Francesco Paolo Rapagnetta. At the age of 13 he
had been adopted by his uncle, Antionio D'Annunzio, and he legally
added the 'D'Annunzio' to his name. In 1858 he married Luisa De
Benedictis; they had three daughters and two sons. </p>
      <p>D'Annunzio studied at the Liceo Cicognini in Prato &#8211; the
school was one of the best in Italy at that time. As a poet D'Annunzio
made his debut at the age of sixteen with&nbsp; <span class="st"><em>Primo
vere</em> </span>(1879). The poems were inspired by Giosuè Carducci's <i>Odi
barbare </i>(1877). In 1881 he entered the University of Rome, where
he fully participated in the capital's social and cultural life, and
contributed to newspapers, particularly <i>Fanfulla della Domenica</i>,
      <i>Capitan Francassa,</i> and <i>Cronaca Bizantina</i>. After
D'Annunzio's father was reluctant to give his blessing to his son's
intention to marry his first love, Giselda Zucconi, D'Annunzio broke
with him. It is also generally agreed that in&nbsp;<em>Il trionfo della
morte</em> (1894, The Triumph of Death) D'Annunzio portrayed him as an
incurable womanizer, as he was in real life. </p>
      <p>In 1883 D'Annunzio married Maria Hardouin di Gallese, a duke's
daughter. They had three sons; the marriage ended in 1891. His
unfaithfulness drove her to attempt suicide&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;she threwn
herself from the window of their apartment. During these years
D'Annunzio produced much hack work in order to support the expensive
life style of his titled wife. However, he also published several
important books of lyrics. His last book, <em>Teneo te, Africa</em>,
came out in 1936 in<em><strong> </strong>Tutte Le Opere</em>; the
title of the work, which hailed the Italian conquest of Ethiopia,
referred to the words attributed to Ceasar, ("I have you, Africa!"). </p>
      <p>A new source of inspiration, in the form of Elvira Natalia
Fraternali, came to D'Annunzio's life in 1887. Known better as Barbara
Leoni, she appeared under the pseudonym Vittoria Doni in <em>Elegie
romane</em> (1892), written during their love affair. Barbara was an
accomplished pianist. She had left her husband after a few weeks of
married life; the marriage had left her with a uterine illness. She
died at the age of 86 in poverty in a <em>pensione</em> run by nuns.
D'Annunzio's works in the 1880s,&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Canto novo</em>&nbsp;(1882),
      <span class="st"><em>Terra vergine </em></span>(1882), and <em>Intermezzo
di rime</em> (1883), expressed the sensuous joys of life. His short
stories showed the influence of the popular French writer Guy de
Maupassant. </p>
      <p><em>Il piacere</em> (1889, The Child of Pleasure) was
D'Annunzio's first full-length novel. The story of a snobbish but
weak-willed decadent was a parody of contemporary French 'decadent'
fiction. "Elena was silent, wrapped in a cape of mink, with a veil
covering her face, her hands in a muff. He breathed with delight the
subtle odor of heliotrope emanating from the precious fur, while
feeling her arm over his. They both felt far removed from the world,
alone; but suddenly a black carriage of a prelate passed by or a
herdsman or a group of clerics or beasts." D'Annunzio's next novel, <em>L'innocente</em>
(1898, The Intruder), was a story where an unfaithful husband Tullio
Hermil, forces his chaste wife, Giuliana,&nbsp;into
adultery.&nbsp;Tullio arranges the death of her illegitimate
baby.&nbsp;Feeling no remorse, he thinks: "Man's justice does not touch
me. No earthly tribunal could judge me."&nbsp;</p>
      <p>D'Annunzio's best-known novel,&nbsp; <em>The Triumph of Death</em>,
featured <a href="nietzsch.htm">Nietzschean</a> hero as his next major
novel <em>Le vergini delle rocce</em> (1896). In&nbsp;<em>The Triumph
of Death</em><span class="st">&nbsp;Barbara Leoni&nbsp;served
as&nbsp;the model for the character Ippolita Sanzio, the mistress of
the hero, a writer obsessed with death. At the end he kills himself, by
jumping from a precipice, and takes Ippolita with him. After Barbara,
D'Annunzio began a liaison with the Sicilian Princess Maria Gravina
Gruyllas di Ramacca, the wife of Count Fernando Anguissola di San
Damiano. Their daughter, Eva Renata Adriana, was born in 1893.
D'Annunzio described Gravina's hair in the poem 'La passeggiata' as
dark "as fallen leaves, / but vital and wild like the writhing / snakes
of Gorgon ...." (<em>Il poema paradisiaco</em>, 1893) In
1893&nbsp;D'Annunzio was condemned to five months in prison for
adultery; the sentence was lifted in the next year. </span></p>
      <p><span class="st"></span>The drama <span class="st"><em>La
figlia di Iorio</em></span> (1904, The Daughter of Jorio) gained much
attention and was enthusiastically imitated. The visionary, excited
imagination of the poet, led him to an exaggerated nationalism, and
ultimately, in the 1920s and 1930s, to his support of Mussolini: he saw
the dictator in the light of mythical heroes, who embodied the spirit
of the nation. D'Annunzio's correspondence with Mussolini appeared in
1971.</p>
      <p>In the early 1890s D'Annunzio moved to Naples, where his
novel, <em>The Intruder</em>, was serialized in <i>Il corriere di
Napoli. </i>After a long liaison with the Countess Gravina Auguissola,
D´Annunzio began in 1894 an affair with the actress Eleonora Duse.
Their relationship started after D'Annunzio's journey to the Aegean
islands. Inspired by Duse, he wrote several dramas for her,
including&nbsp;<em>La Gioconda</em> (1899) and <span class="st"><em>Francesca
da Rimini</em> </span>(1901). </p>
      <p>In<i> La Gioconda </i>Lucio Settàla, a sculptor, has
attempted suicide. He is recovering in the home of his wife Silvia,
whom he had abandoned. Lucio's realizes that he is still in love with
his mistress and creative inspiration, La Gioconda. When the two woman
confront, La Gioconda tries to destroy Lucio's masterpiece &#8211; Silvia
saves it but her hands are smashed. Lucio returns to his art and his
mistress. The play was a fiasco. However, Leonardo da Vinci's <i>Mona
Lisa</i> &#8211; or <i>La Gioconda</i> as it was called in Italy &#8211; remained
D'Annunzio's obsession. He had already in 1889 composed a poem on
mysteriously smiling dame, and republished its shortened version in <i>Il
Giornale d'Iltalia</i> after the painting was stolen in 1911. "Ne la
bocca era il sorriso / fulgidissimo e crudele / che il divino Leonardo
/ perseguì / ne le sue tele." Later D'Annunzio claimed that he had seen
the painting before it was smuggled to Italy and wrote a treatment for
a film, 'The Man who stole the Gioconda'.</p>
      <p>In 1897 D'Annunzio was elected to parliament for a three-year
term, aligning himself in the beginning with the extreme right but
moving then to the left. In 1899 D'Annunzio settled in a luxurious
Tuscan villa, La Capponcina. He was defeated in the elections next
year, but continued to live over his income. Accumulating debts forced
D´Annunzio eventually to flee in 1910 to France, in Arcachon near Cap
Ferret. There he began a new career as a writer.&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Le
Martyre de Saint Sébastien</em></span> (1911), a play-with-music, was
made with the French composer Claude Debussy. In its premiere, starring
Ida Rubinstein, the writer Marcel Proust considered Ida's legs were the
most interesting thing about the event. The work is still performed
because of the celebrated music. </p>
      <p>When World War I broke out, D'Annunzio returned to Italy and
started successful career as a military leader. D'Annunzio had yearned
years for war which would change Italy's position as a second-rate
power. He made speeches, wrote articles exhorting his countrymen to
assist the Allied cause, and joined the air force, becoming one of
Italy's most celebrated heroes.&nbsp;In 1916, D'Annunzio lost&nbsp;the
sight of his right eye &#8211; he dashed his head against the forward
machine-gun while making an emergency landing on the sea at Grado. His
prose pieces in <em>Notturno </em>(1921), deciphered by his daughter
Eva Renata,&nbsp;were composed when he was&nbsp;recovering from the
injury and his both eyes were bandaged.&nbsp;After participating in the
Beffa di Buccari, a daring motor torpedo boat attack into Dalmatia, he
was given another bronze medal for valour. In 1919, annoyed that Italy
had lost the town of Fiume, D´Annunzio's troops occupied the town,
where he ruled it as a dictator for eighteen months until 1920. At one
point he declared war against Italy but was finally forced to retreat. </p>
      <p>Although Mussolini was much influenced by the tactics of
D'Annunzio, the writer never held an important post in the Fascist
government. D'Annunzio retired to his home on Lake Garda and spent his
last years writing. In 1924 he was created Prince of Monte Nevoso and
in 1937, following the death of Marconi, he was made president of the
Italian Royal Academy. D'Annunzio died of a stroke at his desk on March
1, 1938. He was given a state funeral by Mussolini. D´Annunzio´s
collected works were published in the 1950s.</p>

      <p>D'Annunzio's <i>fin-de-siècle</i> works are now mostly
forgotten and his plays are rarely performed. His aim at a kind of
aesthetic perfection has been labelled as hollow and unconvincing, but
on the other hand, the poet Eugenio Montale once said, that "not to
have learned anything from him would be a very bad sign." After World
War II his reputation declined in the new literary atmosphere. However,
his life has fascinated several biographers. Among D'Annunzio's more
enduring works is&nbsp; <em>Il fuoco</em> (1900, The Flame of Life),
where the writer portrays himself as Stelio Effrena, a young writer
infatuated with a famous actress. The novel is a fictionalized account
of his love affair with Duse, and created a onsiderable scandal at the
time of its publication. D'Annunzio's and Duse's relationship ended in
1910, when the Marchioness Alessandra di Rudini-Carolotti found an
admirer from the author. </p>
