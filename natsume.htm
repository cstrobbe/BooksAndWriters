<p>Japanese novelist and essayist, a master of psychological fiction. Soseki's 
best-known works include <i>Kokoro</i> (1914), a story about loneliness and 
friendship of a young student and his mentor, referred to as the honorific 
title of "Sensei". Also <i>Botchan</i>
(1906) has been one of the most read novels in Japan. Several of
Soseki's books examined problems of the modernization of his country.
Along with Ogai Mori (1862-1922), Soseki is considered to be the father
of Modernism in Japanese literature. His portrait appeared on the 1000
yen note from 1984 to 2004. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I always called him "Sensei." I shall
therefore refer to him simply as "Sensei," and not by his real name. It
is not because I consider it more discreet, but it is because I find it
more natural that I do so. Whenever the memory of him comes back to me
now, I find that I think of him as "Sensei" still. And with my pen in
hand, I cannot bring myself to write of him in any other way."</b> (from            </font><i><font size="2">Kokoro</font></i><font size="2">, transl. by Edwin McClellan) </font></blockquote>
<p>Natsume Soseki, usually referred to as Soseki, was born Natsume
Kinosuke in Edo (nowadays Tokyo) into a minor samurai family. He was
the last of six childred, born when his father, Natsume Kohe Naokatsu,
was relatively old, fifty-three, and his mother, forty. Soseki's
father, a well-to-do townsman, held the administrative position of <i>nanushi</i>
(war chief). His parents did not want to raise an unwanted child, and
at the age of two, Soseki was placed with a childless couple named
Shiobara. Seven years later Soseki was returned to his real parents.
"They did not pet me as parents do their youngest children," Soseki
recalled. "I remember particularly that my father treated me rather
harshly". His mother died when he was fourteen. Later in his books
Soseki often dealt with the relationship between parents and their
children.<u> </u></p>
<p>Soseki grew up in period of great changes in Japan's culture and
society. Commodore Matthew Perry's arrival in Edo Bay in 1854 had
marked the "opening" of Japan by the West. Soseki's family lost its
former position as a result of the Meiji Restration, which aimed to
create a more centralized and westernized state. Declining interest in
traditional culture was accompanied by the rise of modern Japanese
language.<br>
</p>
      <p>Soseki attended schools in Tokyo. His early career was marked by relative ambivalence toward English. 
"When I was at high school," Soseki once wrote, "my specialty 
was idling; I did very little work." At the age of nineteen, he met the 
writer <a href="/shiki.htm">Masaoka Shiki</a> (1867-1902), who encouraged him 
to write. He also adopted the pen name Soseki, which replaced his given name. 
Ill from tuberculosis, Masaoka convalesced in 1895 at Natsume Soseki's 
two-storied cottage in the city Matsuyama, 
adjoined by a celebrated hot spring resort. Soseki spent there a year as 
a middle-school teacher of English language. 
 
      </p>

<p>Soseki studied English at Tokyo Imperial University. As a student 
he was extremely scrupulous and dutiful, and suffered during this period 
his first nervous breakdown. In 1892 he became a staff member of 
<i>Tetsugaku Zasshi</i>. After graduating in 1893, he  worked as a 
teacher at Tokyo Normal College (1894-1895) and in a middle school in 
Matsuyama. In 1896 he married Kyoko Nakane, the daugter of a high civil servant, and settled in Kumamoto. </p>
<p>Leaving a pregnant wife and daughter,&nbsp; Soseki went to
England in 1900 on a government scholarship. He stayed in London two unhappy, lonely years, in run-down boarding houses. Nevertheless, his time
Soseki spent usefully, writing, reading, and starting to develop a
literary theory in which he tried to combine Japanese tradition with
western psychological approach. Soseki&#8217;s reflections of his stay in
England were published in the <i>Asahi</i> newspaper in 1909. On
returning to Japan, he become professor at the Imperial University,
succeeding the American writer Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904). Soseki
lectured on literary theory and English literature. </p>
<p>Soseki's  first major work was the anecdotal <i>Wagahai wa neko 
de aru</i> (1905, I Am a Cat), 
written from the viewpoint of a former alley cat.  Noteworthy, Soseki 
himself had also a cat.   
Mr. Kushami (Mr. Sneeze) the owner of the  pet,   is a self-ironic portrait 
of the writer. The story, which first appeared in the literary magazine 
<i>Hotoguisu</i> between 1905-06 and was then expanded into a novel, 
gained a huge success. In <i> Botchan </i>, which takes 
place in Matsuyama although the city is not named explicitly,  Soseki 
returned to 
his experiences as a teacher. "Ever since I was a child, my 
inherent recklessness had brought me nothing but trouble,"  reveals 
the bumbling young protagonist in the beginning. His mother favors his 
elder brother and his father never shows him any affection, 
saying "he'll never amount to anything." 
The novel takes its title from the nickname of the narrator, who has a 
rebellious spirit and who is as determinant in his rejection of petty 
pretensions as Huckleberry Finn or Holden Caulfield. All the other major 
characters have a nickname, too, exept Kiyo, who is the devoted maidservant of 
the family; her name in itself means "pure, clean". 



As a type <font face="Symbol">-</font> a misfit <font face="Symbol">-</font> 
Botchan appeared  in different roles in several following novels. In <i>Nowaki </i>(1907) he is a poor young man dying of tuberculosis, in the partly humorous <i>Sanshiro </i>(1908) a shy provincial youth, and in <i>Kofu </i>(1908) a young man who runs away from home. <i>Yume juya </i> (1908, Ten Nights of Dream) consisted of ten poetic 
stories purpoting to be dreams. It has been said, that modern Japanese fantasy 
began with these tales.  </p>
<p>In 1907 Soseki retired from his university post <font face="Symbol">-</font> a decision which shocked his contemporaries. He then worked as the literary of editor of the newspaper <i>Asahi Shimbun</i>. His early works had been satirical and humorous, but from <i>Kofu</i> (1908, The Miner) his tales began to have dark tones, and his attachment to the pre-modern (Edo) period became more evident. </p>
<p>Between 1905 and 1916, Soseki wrote 14 novels.  <i></i>One of his central 
themes was the conflict between individual needs and the demands of society. 
Often his characters suffer from feelings guilt and of alienation after acting 
against the wishes of their family and traditional values. His later stand 
towards these dilemmas Soseki expressed in the slogan <i>sokuten kyoshi</i> 
(following heaven and abandoning self). When the Ministry of Education offered 
him a doctoral degree, he refused to accept the honour. In 'My Individualism', 
a speech delivered to the students of the Gakushuin, an elite academy, 
he said: "... a nationalist morality comes out a very poor second when 
compared with an individualistic morality. Nations have always been 
most punctilious over the niceties of diplomatic language, but not so with 
the morality of their actions." Natsume Soseki died of stomach ulcer 
on December 9, 1916 in Tokyo. His last work, <i>Meian</i>, was left 
unfinished. <i>Michikusa </i>(1915, Grass on the Wayside) was an 
autobiographical work dealing with marriage problems. </p>
<p>Soseki is still widely read and his major works of fiction have been translated into English, some of them several times. <i>Kokoro</i> was first published in serialized form in <i>Asahi</i>. 
Four of his earlier novels had appeared in the literary journal  <i>Hototogisu </i>between 1905 and 1907. 
The important characters in <i>Kokoro</i>,
in which Soseki used multiple narrators, do not have full names. They
are abstractly referred as K, who is Sensei's friend, or Ojosan, Young
Lady, the daughter of a widow who runs a boarding-house. Sensei, a term
of respect, can be translated as a "teacher" or "master". The
characters are representatives of a certain period but at the same time
they are individuals, with distinct personalities. "Kokoro" may be
translated in many ways, from "heart" or "mind", to "soul," "spirit,"
and "intention". Lafcadio Hearn rendered it "the heart of things." </p>
<p>The first two sections are narrated by a young man referred to as
"I". At the beginning of the story he sees the Sensei with a foreigner
on a beach. "I was a bored young man then, and for lack of anything
better to do, I went to the tea house the following day at exactly the
same hour, hoping to see Sensei again." Although the narrator gets to
know Sensei and his wife better, Sensei's cryptic remarks remain an
enigma to him. "But remember, there is guilt in loving," Sensei says
once to him. "And remember too that, in loving, there is something
sacred." (Note: In the Finnish translation, Sensei says, "love is a
crime", not that "... there is quilt in loving".) The second part
focuses on the narrator and his father, who is dying. The narrator has
graduated and his father confesses, "I am glad, not so much for your
sake, as for my own." In the third part Sensei, an embittered
intellectual, tells in a letter about his past and uncovers events that
culminate in K's suicide. To his young friend he writes: "You and I
belong to different eras, and so we think differently. There is nothing
we can do to bridge the gap between us." Sensei has been betrayed by
his relatives, and he betrays K. For decades he has lived as if he were
dead. Eventually Sensei decides to follow the example of General Nogi
Maresuke <font face="Symbol">-</font> General Nogi killed himself in the old samurai fashion  after the death of his master, 
the Emperor Meiji, who reigned from 1868 to 1912. </p>
