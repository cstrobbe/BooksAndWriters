Rain), which drew its material from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
The title refers to the radioactive rain and fallout that fell on
people. </p>

      <p>Ibuse Masuji was born into an old family of independent
farmers; he was the second son of a Hiroshima landowner. His childhood
Ibuse spent in the country, in the village of Kamo in eastern Hiroshima
Prefecture. "When I recall my memories as a child," Ibuse wrote once in
an essay, "they are on the whole not unpleasant, perhaps because they
are so faded". Ikuta, his father, died in 1903; he was distant and
cold, Ibuse has recalled, but had also published a Chinese poem under a
pen name and loved literature. However, he insisted that none of the
children should pursue a career in literature. The real storyteller of
the family was Ibuse's grandfather Tamizaemon, who was a conservative
custodian of traditions and collected antiques, a hobby which Ibuse
later shared. When he wrote a letter to the famous author Mori Ogai
(1862-1922) while still at school, Ogai noted that the brush strokes
were very "like [those of] an old man." <br>
</p>
      <p>After attending Fukuyama Middle
School near Hiroshima, Ibuse moved in 1917 to Tokyo, where he began
studies at Waseda University. During this period he adopted new ideas
from surrealism to Marxism, that swept through Japan. Although he
specialized in French literature, Ibuse became interested in Russian
writers, chiefly in Tolstoy, a favorite of Ibuse's generation, and
Chekhov. Ibuse's close friend at that time was Aoki Nanpachi, who died
suddenly in 1922. Feelings of guilt haunted Ibuse for decades. </p>

      <p>Ibuse left his studies at the university and the Japanese
School of Art without graduating. In the beginning of the 1920s
appeared his early stories, in which he showed influence of the Western
writers he had studied at Waseda University. Ibuse's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yu hei</span>
(1923), did not gain much success. In the late 1920s, when Japan's
perhaps most influential modern critic Kobayashi Hideo praised Ibuse's
talent, saying that his works are "complex and conscioisly constructed
in every detail", his stories started to gain attention. </p>
      <p>The short story 'Koi' (Carp) marked Ibuse's turning to the
more traditional techniques of his homeland. He used the subjective
Japanese "I-novel" mode, in which narrator and author are one. The
rustic countryside of southern Japan inspired his story 'Tangeshitei'
(1931). It depictied two colorful characters, a master and servant, in
a remote mountain valley. Ibuse's wry humor and psychologically
sharp but sympathetic characterization of villagers, peasants, doctors,
fishermen, and other "unchanging people" became the distinguished
traits of his style. Among Ibuse's prewar works were the historic
novella <span style="font-style: italic;">Sazanami gunki</span> (1930-38) about the final defeat of the Heike
clan in the 12th century. <span style="font-style: italic;">Tajinko mura</span> (1939) portrayed the life of a
village. 'The River', a novella completed in 1932, is considered
Ibuse's first longer work of fiction. </p>
      <p>When Japan entered the WW II, Ibuse served in propaganda
units. Along with the Japanese army, he travelled as a war
correspondent through Thailand and Malaya to Singapore. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hana no machi</span>
(1942, City of Flowers) was about Japanese propagandists in occupied
Singapore, where Ibuse spent one year in the offices of the city's
English-language daily the<i> Strait Times</i>, renamed the <i>Shonan
Times</i> under the Japanese administration. He also lectured on
history at a Japanese language and culture school. While <i>City of
Flowers</i> portrayed the relationships between occupiers and
Singaporeans in a jovial manner, Ibuse later said that he stopped
writing in his diary because "a diary kept with military censorship in
mind seemed idiotic. I clearly realized more and more that though
Singapore had falled, the war would not be over." </p>
      <p>Ibuse witnessed the end of the war and annihilation of
Hiroshima in Kamo. Ibuse did not write much during this period, but his
unwilling induction into military service probably inspired his biting
satire of army drills in the story 'Yohai taicho' (1950, Lieutenant
Lookeast). Ibuse's distate of the military also showed in his other
works, such as <i>Black Rain</i>. </p>
      <p>After the war Ibuse started literary collaboration with <a href="dazai.htm">Osamu Dazai</a>, whose suicide in 1948 deepened
Ibuse's views how fragile the life is. Although they eventually drifted
apart, Ibuse was his patron in Tokyo literary circles, tried to
persuade him to stay away from the drugs, and interacted with his
family. In 1944, they were evacuated to the same village. According to
Ibuse, his friend already seemed prepared to die. Ibuse's works from
the 1940s include <span style="font-style: italic;">Jon Manjiro&#772; hyo&#772;ryu&#772;ki </span>(1940, John Manjiro, the
Castaway), which traces the checkered life of the "drifting people."
This historical novel was awarded the Naoki Prize for Literature in
1938. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hyomin Usaburo</span> (1954-55) also dealt with experiences of men
who left Japan and drifted along strange paths during the last years of
the Tokugawa period. In the allegorical short story 'Noriai Jidosha'
(The Charcoal Bus) Ibuse tells about a journey in a bus, five years
after the war. <font size="2"><b>"</b></font>We crossed a bridge over
a dried-up river; beyond the rice fields I could see the slopes of a
barren-looking mountain. As we passed a Shinto shrine by the side of
the road, the conductor removed his cap and wiped the perspiration from
his forehead. As he did so, he bowed his head slightly, and I wondered
whether this was intended as a mark of respect for the shrine. Such
reverence had been unfashionable for some time after the war but was
now gradually coming back into favor. The conductor's gesture seemed
deliberately ambiguous." <font size="2">(from 'The Charcoal Bus' in </font><i><font size="2">Literature of Asia</font></i><font size="2">, 1999) </font>The
bus has been painted but it still has to run on charcoal. Quarrelling
passangers push it four miles to start the engine. Finally, at a
crossroads, the narrator decides to take another bus, so does some
other people. The rest say that they continue pushing. </p>
      <p>When <i>Black Rain</i> appeared, it was generally thought
that Ibuse, the elder statesman in the Japanese literature, was on the
verge of retirement. On the publication of the work, Ibuse received the
Order of Cultural Merit, Japan's highest honor to a writer, and the
Noma Prize. However, Ibuse was not interested in being labelled a
champion of political causes and later, when he was asked to speak
about the novel, he responded that he had nothing to say. Before his
death of pneumonia in Tokyo on December 1993, Ibuse produced still
several works, including the autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">Hanseiki</span> (1970). Debate
over <i>Black Rain</i> has continued after its publication. Among
others the Nobel laureate <a href="oe.htm">Oe Kenzaburo</a> has seen
Ibuse's fiction as an attempt to humanize the inhuman. However, <i>Black
Rain</i> has become perhaps the world's best known Japanese novel.</p>
      <p>Ibuse Masuji began serializing <i>Black Rain</i> in the
magazine <i>Shincho</i> in January 1965. The novel is based on
historical records of the devastation caused by the atomic bombing of
Hiroshima. However, Ibuse do not refer to social or political
considerations that led to the atomic holocaust. Sometimes his
characters criticize the wartime government but otherwise Ibuse his
view on everyday level. In the depiction of ultimate act of violence,
Ibuse uses contrasts between horror and humor, destruction and beauty,
the state and the individual. The narration alters between Kobatake, a
rural hamlet some distance from Hiroshima, at a time several years
after the end of the war, and Hiroshima itself in the days immediately
after the bombing. The protagonist, Shizuma Shigematsu, a real-life
person, tries to find a husband for his niece, Yasuko. Shigematsu, his
wife Shigeko, and Yasuko reassure prospective husbands that Yasuko was
not affected by the radiation, although she was under the black rain
that followed the destruction. Shigematsu reads his wartime diary to
understand his own life. Yasuko gives up all hopes of marrying and
falls ill with radiation sickness. </p>
