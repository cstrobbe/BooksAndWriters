<P>Prolific Japanese novelist, short-story writer, essayist, and poet, whose 
subject matters ranged from modern 
Japan to ancient China, but he gained fame with his historical fiction. 
Inoue began his literary career after reaching middle age. Among his best-known works 
is <I>Tempyo no iraka</I> (1957, The Roof Tile of Tempyo), set in the 8th-century, 
and describing the journey of a group of Japanese Buddhist monks in China. 
Inoue received several awards and was honored as a &quot;Living National Treasure&quot; of Japan. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;He sat on the expanse of grass, cross-legged in contemplation, 
and old man in a turban. When he opened his eyes I asked him what he prayed for. He said he prayed 
for freedom all mind, all thought. I asked him then how one might enter these mindless regions. 
He said you hold the tongue in the center of the mouth, making quite sure its sides touch against 
nothing.&quot;</B> (from 'Old Man in a Turban', trans. Dennis Keene, from </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">Global Voices</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, 1995) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Inoue Yasushi was born in Asahikawa on the northern island of Hokkaido. His father, Hayao, was an army doctor, who was transferred several times. His mother, Yae Inoue, came from a family of doctors in several generations. At the age of six Inoue was sent to his grandmother, a former geisha. He grew up in the family's native village in Shizuoka Prefecture. While in the Numazu Middle School, Inoue started to read poetry. In 1926 Inoue moved to Kanazawa where his parents lived and attended the Fourth Higher School. During this period his trained obsessively at a judo club and wrote poetry. To his family's disappointment, Inoue failed the entrance examination for the medical school at Kyushu Imperial University. His father, who retired from his work, spent his last years in semi-seclusion raising chickens. Inoue was accepted into the University's English department, but he did not pay much attention to his studies. After entering the Kyoto Imperial University, where he studied aesthetics and philosophy, Inoue received his degree in 1936. His thesis dealt with <A HREF="pvalery.htm">Paul Val&#233;ry</A>'s poetry. </P>
<P>In 1935 Inoue married Adachi Fumi, whose father was a professor of anthropology. Inoue published some poems and short stories in magazines, but he abandoned his career in literature and became a reporter for the weekly magazine <I>Sande Mainichi </I>in Osaka. After serving as a foot soldier in northern China in 1937-38, Inoue continued in the culture department of the Mainichi newspapers. </P>
<P>After the war Inoue made his breakthrough as a writer in 1949 with two short novels, <I>Ryoju</I> (The Hunting Gun) and <I>Togyu</I> &#150; the latter won in 1950 the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for literature. <I>The Hunting Gun</I> is a love story set in the post-war period. It is told from three points of view in letters written to the male protagonist, Josuke. Shoko, his mistress' daughter, has found her mother Saiko's diary and learns that there are secrets between mothers and daughters; his wife goes through their unhappy marriage, and his mistress reveals her true self before her death. Midori is the unhappy wife of Josuke, the husband-lover. The novel originated from a prose poem, inspired by the relationship between a hunting gun and human loneliness, which Inoue wrote for the magazine <I>The Hunter's Companion</I>. &quot;A large seaman's pipe in his mouth, / A setter running before him in grass, / The man strode up the early winter path of Mount Amagi, / And frost cracked under boot-sole. / The band with five and twenty bullets, / The leather coat, dark brown, / The double-barrelled Churchill &#150; / What made him cold, armed with white, bright steel, / To take the lives of creatures?&quot; </P>
<P>Inoue's serialized samurai novel published in the <I>Sunday Mainichi</I> was filmed in 1952 by Hiroshi Inagaki, starring Toshiro Mifune. Inagaki wrote the sceenplay for the film, <I>Sword for Hire</I>, with Akira Kurosawa. In the story civil war and another woman separate a warrior and his lover, a chambermaid, but eventually they are reunited. <I>Sword for Hire</I> was filmed in black-and-white. When it was shown in the United States, it was paired with an Italian sex comedy. Kurosawa also wrote the screenplay for <I>Asunaro monogatari</I> (1955), directed by Hiromichi Horikawa, and based on Inoue's story. <I>Honkakubo Ibun</I> (1981) inspired Kei Kumai's film<I> Sen no Rikyu &#150; honkakubo ibun</I> (1989). It told of a famous tea master, Sen Rikyu, who was an adviser to warlord Hideyoshi. Twenty-seven years after Rikyo's death his disciple Honkakubo tries to determine, whether the tea master committed suicide by his own volition, or whether he was compelled to commit <I>seppuku</I> by Hideyoshi. The film won the Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion Award. </P>
<P>Inoue moved in 1951 to Tokyo and devoted himself entirely to writing. Inoue visited China in the 
late 1950s, where later he also travelled several times, and in 1964 he was elected to the Japan 
Academy of Arts. From 1969 to 1972 he served as chairman of the board of directors for the Japan 
Literary Association. In 1976 he received the Order of Cultural Merit, the highest honor bestowed 
by the Japanese government. Following Kawabata Yasunari, Inoue was elected an international vice 
president of PEN in 1984. Inoue died on January 29, 1991 in Tokyo. His name was frequently 
mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize for literature. </P>
<P>Inoue's tales are often autobiographical and had an essayish objectivity and calmness. &quot;At first encounter, the potential appeal to Western readers of Inoue's writings may seem somewhat limited,&quot; wrote J. Thomas Rimer in A <I>Reader's Guide to Japanese Literature</I> (1999). &quot;While his work is not difficult in terms and style, a certain amount of close attention in needed from readers learning to respond to his celebrated re-creations of life in classical China and early Japan.&quot;   'The Counterfeiter,' written in 1951, is a tragedy of a mediocre artist. The story is narrated by a writer who has been asked to compose the biography of a famous artist. &quot;When I was first approached, I had jumped at the opportunity of taking on this arduous task. I was very fond not only of Keigaku's work but also of Keigaku as an individual. Besides, compiling a biography of Keigaku would be more than just writing a history of Kyoto's art circles with him at the core; it would be like writing a history of Japan's art world.&quot; He finds out that Keikagu had only a few friends, the most important of them the mysterious Shinozaki. The narrator suspects that Shinozaki was in fact Hosen Hara, who had devoted his life to counterfeiting Keigaku's works. Haunted by the fame of Keigaku, Hosen Hara is not able to pursue his own career in the arts. </P>
<P>In <I>Chronicle of My Mother</I> (1975) Inoue tells without sentimentality about his strained relationship with his father, and his mother's illness (Alzheimer's disease?), when she declines into senility. His father's attempt to reach his son with a simple gesture, shaking hands, ends sadly: '' Just that &#150; two hands gently holding onto each other. Then in the next instant I felt my hand being softly pushed away. It was a sensation similar to the slight jerk of the tip of a fishing rod.'' In his mother's fate the author examines the themes of loss, resignation, and loneliness &#150; she forgets her marriage and husband and sinks into a timeless world of childhood images. </P>
<P>Inoue's historical works include <I>Ro-ran </I>(1959), about the rise and fall of a small state 
in Central Asia,<I> Tonko</I> (1959), which deals with Buddhist manuscripts hidden in the Tun-huang 
caves, <I>Aoki okami </I>(1960), a fictional account of the life of Genghis Khan, which was originally 
published in the cultural journal <I>Bungei shunju</I> in 1959-60, and <I>Futo</I> 
(1963, Wind and Waves), about the Mongol attacks in the 13th century. Its material was partly based 
on Inoue's travels in Korea. His visit in the United States produced <I>Wadatsumi</I> (1977), 
an account of Japanese immigration to America. <I>Seiiki monogarari </I>(1968, Journey Beyond 
Samarkand) drew on Inoue's experiences in Central Asia. Inoue paid much attention to historical 
accuracy and frequently consulted with academic 
historians; for <I>Tun-Huang</I> he sought advice from Fujiara Akira (1911-98), a specialist on 
manuscipts and for <I>Tempyo no iraka</I> (The Roof Tile of Tempyo) he consulted with 
Ando Kosei (1900-70). </P>
