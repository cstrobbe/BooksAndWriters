      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Argentine writer, one of the great
masters
of the fantastic short story, who has been compared to <a href="jlborges.htm">Jorge Luis Borges</a>. Many of Cortázar's stories
follow the logic of hallucinations and obsessions. Central themes are
the quest for identity, the hidden reality behind the everyday lives of
common people, and the existential angst. The author's debt to the
French Symbolism and Surrealists has been demonstrated in a number of
studies. Unlike Borges, Cortázar became a political radical who was
involved in anti-Peronist demonstrations and supported the Cuban
revolution, Allende's Chile, and Sandinista Nicaragua. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"No one can retell the plot of a
Cortázar story; each one consists of determined words in a determined
order. If we try to summarize them, we realize that something precious
has been lost."</b> (Jorge Luis Borges) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Julio Cortázar was born in Brussels, Belgium, of Argentine
parents abroad on business. When he was four years old, his family
returned to Buenos Aires, where he grew up in a suburb. Cortázar
attended the Escuela Normal de Profesores Mariano Acosta, a teachers'
training college. In 1935 he received a degree as a secondary-level
teacher. He studied then two years at the University of Buenos Aires
and taught in secondary schools in Bolívar, Chivilcoy, and Mendoza. In
1944-45 he was a professor of French literature at the University of
Cuyo, Mendoza. Cortázar joined there a protest against Peron and was
briefly imprisoned. After being released Cortázar left his post at the
university. From 1946 to 1948 he was a director of a publishing company
in Buenos Aires. He passed examinations in law and languages and worked
then as a translator. </p>
      <p>In 1951, in opposition to Peron's regime, Cortázar travelled
to Paris, where he lived until his death. In 1953 he married Aurora
Bernárdez. They separated and Cortázar lived with Carol Dunlop in later
years. From 1952 he worked for UNESCO as a freelance translator. He
translated among others<i> Robinson Crusoe</i> and stories of <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a> into Spanish &#8211; Poe's influence is
also evident in his work. </p>
      <p><i>Los Reyes</i> (1949) was Cortázar's earliest piece of
fantasy interest. The long narrative poem constituted a meditation on
the role and fate of the Minotaur in his labyrinth. Cortázar's first
collection of short stories, <i>Bestiario</i>, appeared in 1951. It
included 'Casa tomada' (A House Taken Over), in which a middle-aged
brother and sister find that their house is invaded by unidentified
people. The story was first published by Jorge Luis Borges in the
magazine called <i>Los anales de Buenos Aires</i>; Borges's sister
illustrated it. However, Borges did not appreciate Cortázar as a
novelist and once said: "He is trying so hard on every page to be
original that it becomes a tiresome battle of wits, no?" <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Jorge Luis Borges</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Richard
Burgin, 1998) </font></p>
      <blockquote><font color="White" size="2"><b>--</b></font><b><font size="2">'They have taken over our section,' Irene said. The knitting
had reeled off from her hands and the yarn ran back toward the door and
disappared under it. When she saw that the balls of yarn were on the
other side, she dropped the knitting without looking at it. </font><br>
        <font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">'Did you
have time to bring anything?' I asked hopelessly. </font><br>
        <font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">'No,

what we had on. I remembered fifteen thousand pesos in the wardrobe in
my bedroom. Too late now.</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'A House Taken Over') </font></blockquote>
      <p>'Casa tomada' set the pattern for a typical Cortázar story &#8211;
it begins in the real world, then introduces fantastic elements, which
changes the rules of reality. In the title story a young girl senses
that a tiger is roaming through her house. Other collections followed: <i>Final
de juego</i> (1956), <i>Las armas secretas</i> (1959), <i>Historias
de cronopios y de famas</i> (1962), which included 'The Instruction
Manual', one of his most loved pieces, <i>Todos los fuegos el fuego</i>
(1966), <i>Octaedro</i> (1974), and <i>Alguien que anda por ahí</i>
(1977). </p>
      <p>'Las Babas del Diablo' from <i>Las Armas Secretas</i> was
filmed by the Italian director <a href="antonion.htm">Michelangelo
Antonioni</a> under the title <i>Blow-Up</i> (1966). In Cortazár's
story, set in Paris but in Antonioni's version in the London fashion
world, the protagonist is Roberto Michael, an amateur photographer, who
sees a teenage boy and a young woman on a square, and shoots the scene.
He develops the roll, enlarges the picture, and realizes that the woman
was seducing the boy for a man in a car. The picture becomes Michael's
life, he speaks of himself both in the fist person and third persons in
the story: ".... nobody really knows who is telling it, if I am I or
what actually occurred or what I'm seeing... or if, simply I'm telling
a truth which is only my truth..." Antonioni used in his film version
the theme of appearance versus reality and created around it a murder
mystery, which he leaves open. Reality becomes in the film merely a
subjective statement, "life itself is an illusion, a Dionysian
celebration of masked and anonymous revels." <font size="2">(Neil D.
Isaacs in </font><i><font size="2">Modern European Filmmakers and the
Art of Adaptation</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Andrew S. Horton
and Joan Magretta, 1981) </font></p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'It's like a waiting room, life
is,' said the bald gentleman, carefully grinding out his cigarette with
his shoe and examining his hands as if he didn't know what to do with
them now; the elderly lady sighed a yes born of long years of agreeing,
and put away her little bottle just as the door at the end of the
corridor opened and the other lady came out with that look all the
others envied, and an almost sympathetic goodbye when she got to the
exit.'</b> </font><font size="2">(from 'Second Time Around') </font></blockquote>
      <p>As a novelist Cortázar gained first attention with <i>Los
premios</i> (1960), which appeared when the author was 46. The story
centered on a group of people brought together when they win a mystery
cruise in a lottery. The ship-of-fools becomes a microcosmos of the
world order. </p>
      <p>Cortázar's masterpiece, his most famous book, was <i>Rayuela</i>
(1966, Hopscotch), an open-ended anti-novel, in which the author plays
with his charaters as a jazz musician and reader is invited to
rearrange the material. Most of the novel Cortázar wrote in Paris. "The
general idea behind <i>Hopscotch</i>, you see, is the proof of a
failure and the hope of a victory. But the book doesn't propose any
solution; it simply limits itself to showing the possible paths one can
take to knock down the wall, to see what's on the other side."<font size="2"> (interview from Evelyn Picon Garfield,</font><i><font size="2"> Cortázar por Cortázar</font></i><font size="2">, 1978) </font>The
protagonist, Horacio Oliveira, is a writer who is surrounded by a
circle of bohemian friends, who call themselves "the Club". His great
love and mistress is La Maga: "Oh, Maga, whenever I saw a woman who
looked like you a clear, sharp pause would close like a deafening
silence, collapsing like a wet umbrella being closed." After her
disappearance, Oliveira returns to Buenos Aires where he works in odd
jobs. He meets his childhood friend, Traveller, with whom he operates
an insane asylum, ending on the border of insanity himself. </p>
      <p>Oliveira seeks a new world-view outside Cartesian rationalism.
Though he never succeeds, his quest is depicted with humor, superb
imagery, and optimism. There are two narrative sections: chapters 1-36,
which are set in Paris, and chapters 37-56, set in Buenos Aires. The
third selection is entitled "Expendable Chapters." The hopscotch
progress begins at chapter 73. For this reading, led by the directions,
the reader jumps forward and backward through the book. </p>
      <p>Along with such names as Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garzía
Márquez, Carlos Fuentes and <a href="vargas.htm">Mario Vargas Llosa</a>,
Cortázar became known as one of the major representatives of what was
called the "boom" in Latin American Literature. <i>Rayuela</i> was
intended to be a revolutionary novel; a Latin American equivalent to
Laurence Sterne's novel <i>Tristram Shandy </i>(1760-1767). It opened
the door to linguistic innovation of Spanish language and influenced
deeply Latin American writers. The idea for a book based on
disconnected noted continued in<i> 62: Modelo para armar </i>(1968).
Here the reader had less instructions to arrange the parts. <i>Libro
de Manuel</i> (1973) focused on the political condition of Latin
America. In this case the various characters shuttle from a mysterious
Zone and the City according to Godgame-like instructions they cannot
understand or disobey. The novel formed a manual for the child Manuel,
a sort of collage of press clippings, and among others revealed torture
techniques used by U.S. soldiers in the Far East and juxtaposed them to
similar tortures suffered by Latin American political prisoners. </p>
      <p>Cortázar visited Cuba after the revolution, and in 1973 he
travelled in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and Chile. In the 1970s Cortázar
became a member of the Second Russell Tribunal for investigation of
human rights abuses in Latin America. He also gave the Sandinistas the
royalties of some of his last books and helped financially the families
of political prisoners. When the seven-year ban on his entry into
Argentina was lifted, he visited his home country and Nicaragua in
1983. </p>
      <p>In 1975 Cortázar was a visiting lecturer at the University of
Oklahoma, and in 1980 he was a lecturer at Barnard College in New York.
In 1981 he acquired French citizenship. Cortázar received numerous
awards, including Médicis Prize for <i>Libro de Manuel</i> in 1974 and
Rubén Darío Order of Cultural Independence in 1983. He died of leukemia
in Paris on February 12, 1984. Cortázar's friend Christina Peri Rossi
later pondered in her book <i>Yo y Cortázar</i> (2001) did the author
die of AIDS instead of leukemia. Cortázar's works have been translated
into several languages, among others into Finnish. "Anyone who doesn't
read Cortázar is doomed," has the Chilean Nobel writer Pablo Neruda
once said. However, only ten years after Cortázar's death, he was also
characterised as typical for the lost golden age of Latin American
letters.</p>
