<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->French writer, humanist, and moralist who
received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1947. As a novelist, and
still more as an intellectual in search of a moral way, Gide has
appealed to different audiences: a traditional psychological novelist
to some, a taboo-breaker to others; he was a major literary critic,
social crusader, and spokesman for homosexual rights. Gide's search for
self <font face="Times New Roman">&#8211;</font>
the underlying theme of his several works &#8211; remained essentially
religious. Throughout his career Gide used his writings to examine
moral questions in a relentless critical spirit. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is not so much about events
that I'm
curious, as about myself. There's many a man thinks he's capable of
anything, who draws back when it comes to the point... What a gulf
between the imagination and the deed! And no more right to take back
one's move than at chess. Pooh! If one could foresee all the risks,
there'd be no interests in the game!... Between the imagination and a
deed and... Hullo! the bank's come to an end. Here we are on a bridge,
I think, a river..."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Vatican
Cellars</font></i><font size="2">, 1952) </font></blockquote>
<p>André Gide was born in Paris. His father, Paul Gide, a
professor of
law at the University of Paris, was descended from Cévennes Huguenots.
He died in 1880. In<span style="font-style: italic;"> Si le grain ne
meurt...</span>
(1924-26, If It Die: An Autobiography), Gide recalled that his father
"spent most of the day shut up in a vast and rather dark study, into
which I was only allowed when he expressly invited me." In his study he
read his son works by Molière, passages from the <i>Odyssey</i>, and
after discussing with his wife, also the first part of the <i>Book of
Job</i>.
"But the reading certainly made the deepest impression on me, not only
because of the solemnity of the story, but because of the gravity of my
father's voice and my mother's expression, as she sat with her eyes
closed, in order alternately to signify or to shield her pious
absorption, and opened them only to cast a questioning glance on me,
full of love and hope." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">If
It Die</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>
<p>Gide was raised by three women &#8211; his Aunt Claire, the English
spinster Anna Shackleton, and his Calvinist mother, Juliette Rondeaux,
who devoted her life to him. In his childhood Gide was educated mostly
at home &#8211; he was lonely and ill for long periods. At the age of 13,
Gide fell in love with his cousin Madeleine Rondeaux; they married 12
years later, but in 1923, after twenty-seven years of unconsummated
marriage, Gide had a daughter, Catherine, by another woman. Catherine's
mother, Maria Van Rysselberghe, wrote about Gide's domestic life in <i>Cahiers
de la Petite Dame 1918-1945</i> (1973-77). Madeleine died in 1938, his
unconsummated "marriage of Heaven and Hell" Gide dealt in <span style="font-style: italic;">Et nunc manet in te</span> (1951).</p>
<p>Gide attended several schools. At the École Alsacienne Gide
developed an interest in literature. He made friends with other
aspiring writers and artists and attended the literary salons of José
Maria de Heredia and Stéphane Mallarmé. In 1891 Gide made his debut as
a novelist with <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Cahiers d'André
Walter</span>.
He had started to write it at the age of 18. The book, published
anonymously, told the story of an unhappy young man and his pure love
for his cousin Emmanuèle. Next year appeared his first collection of
poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">Poésies</span>, but by 1900
he had practically abandoned poetry.</p>
<p> In 1893 and 1894 Gide traveled to North Africa, learning
different moral and sexual conventions. At Biskra Gide fell ill and
narrowly escaped death. These experiences gave basis for his
psychological novels <i>The Immoralist </i>(1902), about the
destructive force of hedonism and hunger for new experiences, and <i>Strait
is the Gate</i> (1909), the counterpoint of the former work, or the
"twin", as Gide called it. "The capacity to get free is nothing," says
Mchael, the narrator of the <i>Immoralist</i>, "the capacity to be
free, that is the task." In&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Paludes</span>
(1895) Gide examined ironically his former life; Africa had made him
accept his sexual inclinations. He did not advocate homosexuality, but
defended famous homosexuals condemned by the judical system. While in
Algiers, he met <a href="/owilde.htm">Oscar Wilde</a> and Lord Alfred
Douglas. They kept contact over the years. Later Gide said, that "it
seems to me today that in my first essay I spoke of Oscar Wilde's work,
and in particular of his play, with unjust severity. The English as
well as the French led me to do this, and Wilde himself at times showed
an amusing disdain for his comedies" <font size="2">(in 1951 edition
of <i>Oscar Wilde</i>)</font>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Families, I hate you! Shut-in
homes, closed doors, jealous possessions of happiness."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Fruits of the Earth</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Gide's hymn in prose and poetry to the beauty of all, <i>Fruits
of the Earth</i>, appeared in 1897. It became in the 1920s his most
popular work, influencing a generation of young writers, including the
existentialists <a href="/acamus.htm">Albert Camus</a> and <a href="/sartre.htm">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, to cast off all that is
artificial or merely conventional. In 1909 Gide helped found the
influential literary magazine <i>Nouvelle Revue française</i> (The New
French Review). For it he wrote a large number of essays and reviews.
Gide rejected nationalism in French literature. He stated that "great
minds never fear influences; on the contrary, they seek them with a
sort of eagerness like the eagerness of being." Gide's defense of
homosexuality in <span style="font-style: italic;">Corydon</span>,
published first privately in 1911, was violently attacked. With the
British writer Dorothy Strachey Bussy (1865-1960) he formed a lifelong
friendship. She spent much of her life in France and translated a
number of Gide's novels into English. Bussy, whose brother was the
biographer Lytton Strachey, was bisexual. She married the painter Simon
Bussy and had a daughter, who also became a painter. </p>
<p>Until 1914 Gide was firmly convinced that he would be read
only after his death, claimed Walter Benjamin, who interviewed the
author in the late 1920s. "No European writer living today has given as
cold a reception to his own fame as he did, when his finally arrived,
toward the end of his forties," Benjamin wrote. Gide began to keep in
1916 a second journal, in which he
recorded
his search for God. His religious crisis of 1915-16 Gide analyzed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Numquid et tu... ?</span>
(1922). On 4 August 1922 he wrote in the journal, "I present my own
ethics under the cover of Dostoevsky." Gide's interest in the Russian
writer went back to his youth. In 1923 he published a book on
Dostoevsky, which consisted mainly on lectures and earlier writings.
Gide noted that Dostoevsky's main ideas were expressed through his
characters: "He lost himself in each of the characters of his books and
for this reason it is in them that he can be found again." Gide also
recorded his everyday observations in his journal, examining often
vices mirroring the problems of society. "<i>10 May 1927</i>: Many
opium smokers and cocaine addicts in Zurich. Some of them, Rychner
tells me, began to inject themselves during their last year at the
Gymnasium; that is, when aged sixteen or seventeen. He knows one whom
the professors caught using a syringe in a final examination. Cornered,
he confessed that he had got his habit in class. 'Do you think anyone
could endure the dullness of X's teaching without shooting up?' he
asked."</p>
<p>After the mid-1920s Gide became a champion of society's
victims, who demanded more humane conditions for criminals.
He had observed social injustices more closely than many other writers
from the 1890s &#8211; first as mayor of a commune in Normandy (1896), and
later as a juror in Rouen (1912), and then as a special envoy of the
Colonial Ministry (1925-26). In July 1925 Gide set out for a journey to
the Congo with his friend Marc Allegret, returning in 1927. During this
time Gide published <i>If It Die...</i>, which has been compared to
Jacques Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i>. In the 1930s Gide announced his
conversion to Communism, which shocked his readers, but he also was
rejected by his new admirers after his disillusioning trip to the
Soviet Union in 1936.
</p>
<p>In the novel <i><i>The Counterfreiters</i></i> (1926) Gide
exposed
the hypocrisy and self-deception with which people try to avoid
sincerity. The protagonist, Edouard, keeps a journal of events in order
to write a novel about the nature of reality. Another internal author &#8211;
the 'pseudo-author', an intervening first person voice &#8211; comments the
action. Edouard falls in love with his nephew Oliver Molinier. Through
their story Gide illustrates what he considered a constructive
homosexual relationship. Numerous themes are woven into the complex
structure, not only the novelist writing a novel about a novelist who
is writing a novel about forging. The intrigues of a gang of
counterfeiters symbolize the counterfeit personalities with which
people disguise themselves. The novels ends with the suicide of one of
the characters. </p>
<p><i>The Pastoral Symphony </i>(1919), written in the form of
the
diary, explored the hypocrisy which masquerades as Christian pity and
duty. In the story a Swiss Protestant pastor adopts and educates the
blind orphan Gertrude. The pastor is afraid that Gertrude loves him
less than his son Jacques, and seduces the girl on the eve of an
operation, which may restore her sight. After the successful operation,
Gertrude understands the truth about the people around her and she
commits suicide. The pastor doesn't realize his own blindness before he
starts to re-examine his own thinking and behavior. The film version of
the book, directed by Jean Delannoy, gained critical and popular
success in 1946, but the author himself was not happy with the result.
Delannoy gave Gerture her sight some two-thirds of the way through the
film, not at the end. The novella, Gide claimed, "makes sense only in
terms of its artistic construction. It is, in sum, a tragedy in five
acts which takes on its final value only through the long night of the
first four acts. The young blind girl recovers her sight only in the
last pages &#8211; to her detriment as it turns out. Everything resides in
this sudden rupture. They explained to me that the necessities of the
screen warranted a new conception of the tale, that it had to be
translated into another language."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Gide's
novella <i>Isabelle </i>
exposed illusions of a young student, who falls in love with a woman
pictured in a mysterious miniature. It was published in the UK in the
same volume as <i>La Symphonie Pastorale</i>. </p>
<p>Gide's trip to the U.S.S.R., where he was given the place of
honor
at the funeral of Maxim Gorky and seated next to Stalin on various
occasions, led to his famous break with Communism. <a href="/malraux.htm">André Malraux</a> advised him not to publish his
report on the journey,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Retour de
l'U.R.S.S.</span>
(1936), in which Gide made a decisive break with the Soviets. In the
footnote to the oppression of homosexuality by the Stalinist regime he
cited a Persian proverb: "women for duty, boys for pleasure, melons for
delight." However, in this book Gide was not so open about his
sexuality as he was in many others. The
appearence of the report at the crucial moments of the Spanish Civil
War
made Gide the target of Leftist wrath. </p>
<p>From 1942 until the end of WW II, Gide lived in North Africa.
After the war Communist writers, <a href="/aragon.htm">Louis Aragon</a>
included, tarred him as a Nazi collaborator. In the 1940s Gide began
receive honors, which culminated in the Nobel Prize.
Gide's correspondence with his friends Francis Jammes (pub. 1948) and
Paul Claudel (pub. 1949) reveals their unsuccessful attempt to convert
the author to Catholicism, but Gide remained more concerned with
self-examination than religion. Among Gide's later works is <span style="font-style: italic;">Thésée </span>(1946),
which contributed to the renewed use of Greek myth in the 20th century
literature; in this book, it was the tale of the Minotaur's labyrinth.
Gide died on February 19, 1951. His friends Martin du Gard and François
Mauriac later had a quarrel on Gide's words on his deathbed; Martin du
Gard did not accept the religious tone&nbsp; given to Gide's burial.
Nevertheless, the Catholic Church placed in 1952 all his works on
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Index librorum prohibitorum</span>,
thus forbidding all Catholics, under pain of mortal sin, to read any of
his writings. The Index itself was abolished fourteen years later.
Gide's wide correspondence with Proust, Paul
Claudel, Rainer Maria Rilke, Paul Valéry, Martin du Gard, and others
started to appear regularly in 1948. </p>
