<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->"Bitter Bierce" &#8211; American newspaper
columnist, satirist, essayist, short-story writer, and novelist, an
enigmatic figure, who disappeared
in the Mexican Revolution. His end is still a mystery, but he is
presumed to have died in the siege of Ojinega on 11 January 1914.
Bierce is best-known for his numerous short stories collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tales of Soldiers and Civilians </span>(1891),
which show the influence of <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a>.
However, Bierce himself was annoyed by comparisons. As a literary
critic he was against realism. After Stephen Crane published his famous
novel about the Civil War, <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>, Bierce
wrote: "I had thought there could be only two worse writers than
Stephen Crane, namely, two Stephen Cranes." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"John Searing, a man of courage,
the formidable enemy, the strong, resolute warrior, was as pale as a
ghost. His jaw was fallen; his eyes protruded; he trembled in every
fibre; a cold sweat bathed his entire body; he screamed with fear. He
was not insane &#8211; he was terrified." </b>(from 'One of the Missing',
1888) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce was born in Meigs County, Ohio, the
tenth of thirteen children of Marcus and Laura (Sherwood) Bierce. Each
of the children was given a name beginning with the letter "A".
Bierce's father had a large private library, and he spent much time
with the books &#8211; his name Marcus Aurelius was given after the famous
Roman emperor. Bierce grew up on a farm in northern Indiana. Later, in
his parody of 'The Old Oaken Bucket', Bierce wrote about his early
years: "With what anguish of mind I remember my childhood, / Recalled
in the light of a knowledge since gained; / The malarious farm, the
wet, fungus grown wildwood, / The chills then contracted that since
have remained." Bierce studied year in a high school. At the age of
fifteen he became a printer's apprentice on <i>The Northern Indianan</i>,
an antislavery paper. After a term at a military school, he worked in a
combination store and café. </p>
      <p>Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Bierce enlisted in the
army in 1861, rising eventually to the rank of lieutenant. He served
nearly four years in the Union Army &#8211; an experience that was crucial
for his life and career as a writer. He fought in several bloody
battles including Shiloh, Pickett's Mill, Missionary Ridge, and the one
that later provided the setting for 'Chickamauga' (1889), one of his
best stories. It tells about a little boy who sees wounded crawling
toward a creek from one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. He
leads the company to his home. The place is burning, and finds his
mother dead. </p>
      <p>At the Battle of Kenesaw Mountain, Bierce was wounded in June
1894 in the head; the bullet lodged within his skull behind his left
ear, but he returned to General William B. Hazen's brigade in
September. On leave his engagement with Bernie (Fatima) Wright was
broken for unknown reasons. After the war Bierce served briefly as a
Treasury aide in Alabama. He was a topographical officer on General
William B. Hazen's staff, and then settled in San Francisco, where he
began his journalistic career. Bierce contributed to a number of
periodicals, among others the <i>Overland Monthly </i>and the <i>Californian.</i>
In 1868 he became the editor of the <i>News-Letter and California
Advertiser</i>. His first story, 'The Haunted Valley', appeared in 1871
in the <i>Overland Monthly</i>. </p>
      <p>In 1871 Bierce married a wealthy miner's daughter, Mollie Day;
they had two sons and a daughter. As seveal other American writers, he
decided to seek his fortune England, where he lived with his family in
London from 1872 to 1875, and wrote sketches for the magazines <i>Figaro</i>
and <i>Fun</i>. "But, generally speaking, the English are good
fellows, the Scotch are better, and the Irish are a bad lot," he said
in a letter. With their white hair and eyebrowns Biece and Mark Twain
were frequently mistaken for each other. During this time he published
three volumes of sketches and epigrams, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fiend's Delight </span>(1872), <span style="font-style: italic;">Nuggets and Dust Panned Out in California</span> (1872), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Cobwebs from an Empty Skull</span> (1874).
      <i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i> included Bierce's most
celebrated tale, 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge'. "A man stood upon
a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift
water twenty feet below. The man's hands were behind his back, the
wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck." The story
continues with a lucky miracle &#8211; the rope breaks, and Peyton Farquhar
escapes from the execution and returns to his wife at his plantation.
But in the end Bierce reveals that this is merely a fantasy, occurring
just before his death. "Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a
broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the
Owl Creek Bridge." As disillusioned was his view of the soldiers who
fell at Shiloh: "Faugh! I cannot catalogue the charms of the these
gallant gentlemen who had got what they enlisted for." </p>
      <p>After returning to San Francisco, Bierce took a job at the
U.S. Mint. In 1877 Bierce worked as an associate editor of the San
Francisco <i>Argonaut</i>, a weekly paper. With Thomas A. Harcourth he
wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dance of Death</span> (1877) under the pseudonym William Herman.
Before going back to San Francisco to work for the <i>Wasp</i>, he
tried his luck in the mining business in the Dakota Territory without
success. Bierce joined then the San Francisco <i>Examiner</i>, which
started his long career as one of the most respected columnists and
contributors to the Hearst publications. With Gustav Adolph Danziger he
translated Richard Voss's <i>The Monk and the Hangman's Daughter</i>,
and quarreled with his collaborator ceaselessly. The story was based on
a German tale. Danziger wanted to give it a happy ending, Bierce
preferred the retention of the tragic part. </p>
      <p>Bierce's marriage was stormy. The couple separated in 1888 and
divorced in 1905. No wonder that in <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Devil's Dictionary</span> (1911) <i> </i>Bierce defined happiness "as
an agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of
another." He also said: "You are not permitted to kill a woman who has
wronged you, but nothing forbids you to reflect that she is growing
older every minute. You are avenged 1440 times a day." An exeption was
Lily Walsh, a deaf-mute poet and Bierce protege, whom he helped during
her short life. </p>
      <p>Between the years 1887 and 1906 he wrote his famous "Prattle"
column, which was a mixture of literary gossip, epigrams, and stories.
He did not have much passion for writing novels, but preferred the
short story. His sardonic and cruel epigrams and aphorisms Bierce
gathered in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cynic's Wordbook</span>
(1906). When he edited his twelve-volume <span style="font-style: italic;">Collected Works </span>(1909-1912),
however, he changed the title of this work to <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i>.<font size="2"> </font> Although Bierce was called "wicked" and "devilish",
behind the misanthropic facade was a disappointed idealist, who saw a
saint as "a dead sinner revised and edited", and a marriage "a
community consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in
all, two." When his friend suggested him to write a book of memoir, one
of the planned titles was <i>The Autobiography of a Much Misunderstood
Man</i>. Bierce's satires have much in common with the views of Swift
and <a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a>, whom he had read. Bierce also
confessed his debt to Stoicism, the especially praised Epictetus. His
attitude to religion was worldly: "Treat things divine with marked
respect &#8211; don't have anything to do with them." </p>
      <p> Bierce was sent in 1896 to Washington, D.C., where he lobbied
for Hearst, but a decade later refused to join in the rivalry with
Pulitzer's New York <i>World</i>. "I know nothing about the
quarrel&#8212;did not know there was one&#8212;and know nothing about<i> him</i>,"
he said in a letter. "I should have to rely on your fellows in New York
for my material facts, and there are not many of them whom I would
believe under oath." Bierce's greatest achievement was the defeating of
the railroad baron C.P. Huntington. As a protest to the tampering with
his work at the New York <i>Journal, </i> Bierce resigned from
Heart's employ for a brief period &#8211; Hearst wanted to keep one of the
best of his editorialists. Eventually Bierce found a refuge at the<i>
Cosmopolitan, </i> where his writings appeared sporadically. </p>
      <p>In contrast to his success in journalism, Bierce's private
life went down hill. His marriage started to fall apart, and he had
problems with alcohol. His son, Day, had run away from home at fifteen.
Day killed a rival suitor of a sixteen-year-old girl and eventually was
killed in a duel in 1889. Bierce's other son, Leigh, died of died of
pneumonia at the age of 26. In the 1890s Beirce published some of his
best works, including <i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i>. From
1900 to 1913 Bierce lived and worked mainly in Washington. Among his
friends and drinking companions was <a href="mencken.htm">H.L. Mencken</a>.
Once Bierce told him that he kept the ashes of his son on his writing
desk. Mencken said that the urn must be a formidable ornament. '"Urn
hell!" he answered. "I keep them in a cigar-box."' <font size="2">(from
      </font><i><font size="2">Prejudices</font></i><font size="2"> by
H.L. Mencken, 1927) </font></p>
      <p>Late in 1913, at the age of seventy-one, Bierce retired from
writing and went to Mexico, to seek "the good, kind darkness." He
vanished mysteriously during the civil war. "I am going away to South
America, and have not the faintest notion when I shall return," he
wrote to Samuel Loveman on September 10, 1913. From Chihuahua he posted
a letter which was his last. According to one explanation by Roy Morris
(and others) Bierce did not go to Mexico at all but, instead, committed
suicide in the Grand Canyon. One wild story tells that he was held
captive by a tribe of Brazilian Indians. A fictional account of
Bierce's last days is given in the novel <i>The Old Gringo</i> (1985)
by Carlos Fuentes. The book was adapted into screen in 1989 and
directed by Luis Punzo, starring Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck. Ambrose
Bierce has also influenced such South American writers as <a href="jlborges.htm">Jorge Luis Borges</a> and <a href="cortaz.htm">Julio
Cortázar</a>. </p>
