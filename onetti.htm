<p>Uruguayan novelist and short-story writer, a master in fusing
fantasy and realism. Onetti was awarded Uruguay's national literature
prize in 1963 and Spain's prestigious Cervantes Prize in 1980. In <i>La vida breve</i>
(1950) Onetti created the fictional port town of Santa María, which
also is the setting of his later works. Onetti wrote with a mixture of
comedy and sadness about the loneliness of life, absurd values, the
futility of religion, and the breakdown of modern town life. Although
the tone was often pessimistic, his stories were rich in imagination. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I don't know, exactly, when I decided
irremediably to accept human stupidity, Santa María, Lavanda, and the
rest of the world that I would always be unacquainted with. To keep
myself from contradicting. I don't know when I learned to savor in
silence my total enmity toward males and females. But my meeting up
with Quinteros-Osuna, with his powerful mindlessness, with his
incredible talent for making money, brought about an inner
self-abandonment, forced me to accept with enthusiasm that form of
imbecility which he recognized in me, with exaggerated, almost envious
paeans of praise. So I said yes to everything and added details,
improvements."</b> (in</font> <i><font size="2">Let the Wind Speak</font></i><font size="2">, 1979) </font></blockquote>

 

<p>Juan Carlos Onetti was born in Montevideo of Uruguayan, Brazilian,
and possibly Irish background. Little is known about his youth. He had
an older brother, Raúl and a younger sister, Raquel. Onetti once
remarked that he was a great liar as a child and he invented fantastic
characters he felt were real. His father, Carlos Onetti, was a
customs official, and his mother, Honoria Borges, came from a wealthy
land owning family. Onetti never completed his secondary education and
spent his first twenty years in his native Uruguay, working in odd
jobs. He then moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he worked as a
journalist and began publishing short stories in the early 1930s. </p><p>While in Montevideo Onetti&nbsp;was the editor of&nbsp;the highly regarded weekly journal <em>Marcha </em>from
1939 to 1942. During&nbsp;these years&nbsp;he promoted a radical
transformation of literature and emphasized devotion to art. He
attacked the tendency to focus on the Nature, and gauchos were for him
old-fashioned literary types. Onetti saw that writers should develop
stories about the cities. He admired <a href="faulkner.htm">William Faulkner</a><font face="Symbol">&nbsp;- </font>Santa
Maria, a combination of Argentine and Uruguayan coastal towns,
developed into Onetti's Yoknapatawpha. Another source of inspiration
was the French writer <a href="lfceline.htm">Louis-Ferdinand Céline</a>, with his intense use of language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Onetti's first novella, <i>El pozo</i>
(1939) has been hailed by many critics as the first truly modern
Spanish American novel, and a precursor to the Magic Realism. The
Spanish language edition comprised sixty-one pages.&nbsp;Onetti used
modernist narrative technique, and brought on the scene a character
familiar from the works of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. The
protagonist, Eladio Linacero, resembles Knut Hamsun's hero in <i>Hunger</i> (1890). He leads his aimless life in a city, where he is unable to communicate with others&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font>
they don't understand him and he don't understand them. He is separated
from his wife and has only occasional contact with prostitutes. "The
few people that I know are unworthy of having the sun touch their
faces," he thinks. "Behind us, there is nothing. One gaucho, two
gauchos, thirty-three gauchos." In his nightly self-torture, Linscero
recalls his rape of a girl and moral degradation. <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Tierra de nadie </i>(1941)
was set in Buenos Aires and consisted of brief scenes and
conversations. In the end Aránzuru, the author sits by the river,
meditating the aimless life in the city:<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"Invisible,
behind his back, was the city with its dirty air, its high buildings
with the coming and going of people, greetings, deaths, hands and
faces, games. It was already night and the city buzzed below the
lights, with its men, its hats, boys, handkerchiefs, shopwindows,
footsteps, footsteps like blood, like hail, footsteps like a current
without a destination." </p>


<p>The three-volume cycle of novels and stories, often called the 'Santa María Sagas,' appeared in the 1950s. <i>La vida brev</i>e was written in Buenos Aires, where he stayed&nbsp; because Perón's government viewed him as a dissident. The narrator is Juan María Bransen, an employee in a publicity firm and
a writer, who invents a fantasy existence for himself as Dr. Díaz Grey,
the protagonist of a screenplay he is writing. Grey is usually a
neutral observer, as grey as his name implies.&nbsp; <i>Los adioses</i> (1954) had&nbsp; a beginning, middle, and end, but also an unrealiable narrator, typical for Onetti fiction. In <i>La cara de la desgracia </i>(1960)
a guilt-ridden&nbsp;nameless narrator&nbsp;accepts responsibility for
the deaths of his brother and a&nbsp;deaf girl, whom he met at a
seaside resort. The narrator is accused of her murder. 'El álbum'
(1953), later&nbsp;collected&nbsp;in <em>Para una tumba sin nombre</em>,
tells of Jorge Malabia, the son of a prominent Santa María
family.&nbsp;Towards the end of the&nbsp;story he visits a brothel, but
he is not the central character in his own tale: the prologues to
his&nbsp; sexual initiation occupy the greater part of the narrative.
Díaz Grey, the listener of Jorge's confessions,&nbsp;claims that he is
a bad storyteller, he is too slow.</p><p><i>El astillero</i> (1961),
also set in Santa María, focused on the life of Larsen (alias The
Bodysnatcher),&nbsp;the ex-owner of&nbsp;the illfated&nbsp;brothel, who
works in a rusting shipyard. He plans to marry the daughter of its
owner, but the shipyard becomes a symbolic landscape of his own ruin:
"Erect, exaggeratedly strutting, he avoided pieces of hanging iron with
shapes and names which rested imprisoned on a confusion of wires and
penetrated into the shade, into the distant cold, into the reticence of
the shed. He reviewed the desks, the threads of rain, the nets of dust
and spider webs, the reddish-black machines which continued simulating
dignity."<font size="2"></font> Larsen appeared first time in Onetti's second novel, <i>Tierra de nadie</i> (1941). <i>Juntacádaveres</i>
(1965) took Larsen back to a time when he was called to set up the
whorehouse. Despite official support by the town councillor, the
project is defeated by public opinion. The brothel is a threat to
the&nbsp;values of Santa María&nbsp;and Larsen and the girls are
expelled from the town. Noteworthy, Larsen is not the protagonist, Díaz
Grey and Jorge Malabia are more important characters. </p>
<p>Onetti&nbsp;was editor for Reuters News Agency, first in Montevideo
(1941-43), and then in Buenos Aires (1943-46).&nbsp; From 1946 to
1955&nbsp;he edited in Buenos Aires the <i>Vea y Lea</i>. Before being appointed&nbsp;in 1957&nbsp;director of Municipal
Libraries in Montevideo, Onetti worked as manager of an advertising
company.&nbsp; </p><p>
As a writer he attracted little critical attention outside Uruguay
until the mid-1960s. "Latin American literature has few secrets to
divulge to the English speaking world; but one of them is the Uruguayan
novelist Juan Carlos Onetti," Gerald Martin said in <i>The Guardian</i>.
Onetti's international reputation, and the fact that he was considered
the most distinguished Uruguayan author, did not prevent his
imprisonment in 1974 by the military dictatorship. He had been a member
of the jury, that awarded a literary prize to a short story by Nelson
Marra, which the authorities considered to be pornographic and
offensive. Onetti was briefly incarcerated in a mental institution.
After being released Onetti moved to Madrid and in 1975 he became
Spanish citizen. He refused to go back to his country even when
democracy was restored. In his new home country Onetti worked at a
number of odd-jobs including a waiter, salesman, and doorman in a
nightclub. Reflecting his growing pessimism, Onetti had Santa María
devoured by fire in<i> Dejemos hablas al viento</i> (1979, Let the Wind Speak), his first novel written in Spain. Larsen reappears as a ghost. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Onetti's uneven, troubled career has
resolved itself into a large body of critically admired prose that,
finally, hews to a single driving artistic impulse: the necessary
predominance of writing process. Onetti's anguished, detached
narrators, creators of public words and private torments, brought Latin
American fiction out of its provincial stasis at a time when talent,
opportunity, and attention were poised to grant it greatness, and the
Latin American novel from the 1940s onward stands as the heir to
Onetti's artistic, self-examining vision."</b> (Bart L. Lewis in </font><i><font size="2">Contemporary World Writers</font></i><font size="2">, edited by Tracy Chevalier, 1993) </font></blockquote>
<p>Onetti received several awards, including National Literature Prize
(1962), William Faulkner Foundation Ibero-American Award (1963), Casa
de las Américas Prize (1965), Italian-Latin American Institute Prize
(1972), Miguel de Cervantes Prize (1980). In 1985, the new president of
Uruguay travelled to Spain to present Onetti with the National Literary
award. Onetti was married four times, first with his cousin María
Amalia Onetti (1930-1933); they had one son. His second wife&nbsp;was his cousin María
Julia Onetti. After&nbsp;divorce,&nbsp;Onetti married Elizabeth
María&nbsp; Pekelharing in 1945,&nbsp;a fellow worker in Reuters; they
had one daughter. Onetti's fourth wife from 1980 was Dorothea Muhr, a
violinist; they had lived together for 25 years. Onetti died in Madrid,
on May 30, 1994.</p>
