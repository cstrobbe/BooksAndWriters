<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->French writer, who gained fame at the age of forty-three with his first novel, <i>Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique</i>
(1967, Friday; or, The Other Island), an ingenious reworking of the
classic Robinson Crusoe theme. Michel Tournier's parodic and sometimes
disturbing works can be read as comments upon the contemporary world,
but are often based on old myths and stories. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Robinson was too exhausted to measure the full extent of his misfortune. "Since it isn't Más a Tierra"</b></font><b><font size="2"> he reflected simply, "then it is the Island of Desolation," summing up his own situation with this impropmptu babtism. </font></b><font size="2">(in </font><font size="2"><i>Friday</i>, 1967</font><font size="2">)</font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"></font></blockquote>
<p>Michel Tournier was born in Paris, the son of Alphonse Tournier, and
Marie-Madeleine, née Fournier. His parents had met at the Sorbonne
where they both studied German. Tournier also learned to speak German
at an early age, when each summer his mother would take her children to
stay in her favorite boarding house in Germany. After being wounded in
the World War I, his father had given up the idea of becoming a
teacher. He started a business to take in royalties for authors' record
rights. These recorded texts, and the tales of Andersen, Selma
Lagerlöf, James Oliver Curwood, gave rise to Tournier's hunger for the
world of imagination and love for books. The family lived first near
the fashionable Boulevard Haussmann. Later they moved to a large house
in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. In 1957 his family bought a
former rectory in the hamlet of Choisel as a vacation home. It became
eventually Tournier's permanent residence. </p>
<p>Tournier was educated at St.-Germain-en Laye and at a large number
of private schools, mostly religious. During World War II German
soldiers were stationed in the family's Saint-Germain-en Laye. Tournier
completed his undergraduate studies and partly under the influence of
Gaston Bachelard and Jean-Paul Sartre, he continued to higher degrees
in philosophy and law at Sorbonne. He spent four years at the
University of Tübinbeg (1946-50), planning a career in philosophy and
education. His thesis was about Plato. Like his father, he did not pass
the <i>agrégation</i>, a competitive state examination for admission
to the most important teaching jobs. When he failed on his second
attempt, Tournier abandoned his plan to become a teacher of philosophy.
</p>
<p>Between 1949 and 1954 Tournier wrote and produced for French radio
and television. He was the chief editor for the publishing firm of Plon
(1958-68), a press attaché at the Radio Europe I (1964-1968), and
hosted the television series <i>La Chambre Noir, </i> which was about
photography. "I wasn't unhappy, but things weren't going well," he
recalled. "To be a failure is fine when you're young, but the older you
get, the harder it is to stand it." He wrote for the magazine <i>Nouvelles Littéraires</i> and translated Erich Maria Remarque's novels into French. In <i>World Authors 1975-80</i>
Tournier describes this period as an excellent time to prepare his
first novel and reconcile fiction and philosophy using myths as a
vehicle. He wrote three novels, which he did not consider worthy of
being offered for publication.</p>
<p>Tournier's mythic novels hit the literary scene at the right moment,
when the audience was tired of the nouveau roman, with its difficult
style of writing, avoidance of character analysis, absence of clear
narrative, and emphasis on description instead of dramatization. When
he began writing, he took as models such authors as Zola, Jules Renard,
and Colette. Turning his back on the modern world, Tournier sought
inspiration from the realms of fantasy and old stories told from a
fresh point of view. He showed that readability doesn't mean lack of
depth. "A dead myth is called allegory," Tournier once said. "The
writer's function is to prevent myths turning into allegories." Not
satisfied in merely retelling established myths and legends, Tournier
deconstructs them in such a way that opens new ways of interpretation.
Like in the work of the Swedish Nobel writer <a href="perlager">Pär Lagerkvist</a>,
the fundamental questions of good and evil, human suffering and meaning
of existence, are examined in the context of Christian and alternative
paradigms. </p>
<p>With <i>Friday</i> Tournier won in 1967 the Grand Prix de Roman. It retells Daniel Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> but gives the story a philosophical depth. (Nearly 20 years later the Nobel writer <a href="coetzee.htm">J.M. Coetzee</a>  played  with Defoe's classic novel  in <i>Foe</i>.
This time a woman shares the island with Robinson and Friday.) The
famous hero is marooned on the desert island with his pipe tobacco, a
copy of the Bible, and a modern identity problem. After abandoning his
cultural background and sinking into animalism, Crusoe returns to the
world of the spirit by the noble act of writing. "A new life thus began
for him &#8211; or more exactly, it was the beginning of his true life on the
island, after that period of degradation which he now thought of with
shame and sought to forget." Crusoe develops a mystical relationship
with his island, which he names Esperanza. When the rescue ship
appears, Crusoe rejects the brutality of civilization reflected in the
ship's crew. He stays on the island, and Friday chooses to leave, not
accepting Crusoe's version of the world.</p>
<p>In sympathy with other workers, Tournier went on strike and was fired, 
but his severance  allowed him to continue his writing. 
Three years later Tournier published his second novel, <i>Le Roi des aulnes</i>
(1970, The Ogre), which won the Prix Goncourt. The work was inspired by
Goethe's famous ballad, 'Der Erlkönig' (1782), and Günter Grass's <i>The Tin Drum</i> (1959).  Tournier brought together the myths 
of St Christopher and the Erl King, set against the background of East Prussia during 
the Third Reich. In the novel the ogre, Abel Tiffauges, is a monstrous and innocent 
character, a French prisoner in Germany who assists the Nazis by searching for boys 
for a Nazi military camp. Tiffauges is obsessed by his conviction that everything in 
the world is a sign. In the end he perishes while rescuing a little Jewish boy. 
In 1975 there appeared <i>Les Météores</i>  (Gemini), a baroque treatment 
of the myth of Castor and Pollux, which could be read as a contemporary version of 
Jules Verne's <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i>. Beginning from Crusoe, 
Tournier's men are 
often solitary characters; he sees that the 
the natural antagonism of male and female is the major source of problems for 
human beings. In <i>Gemini</i> Thomas Koussek argues that "the 
heterosexual wants to lead the free, unattached life of the homosexual nobility. But the 
more he breaks out, the more firmly he is recalled to his proletarian condition."  
 </p>
<p> <i>Friday</i>, rewritten for children as <i>Friday and Robinson</i>
(1971), was less than half the lenght of the original. For the most
part, Crusoe's logbook entries were eliminated, but Tournier added also
new scenes, such as the invention of games and arts. Some of this
material was introduced into the revised adult paperbacke edition in
1972. Enjoying an enormous popularity in France, the children's version
was made by Antoine Vitez into a stage play and in 1982 it was adapted
into a six-hour TV series. "For Tournier, writing can only ever be
rewriting, not just the rewriting of key myths but also conscious and
unconscious inter-textuality. The rewriting of Friday for children is
merely the most obvious example of a compulsion to rework his fictional
narratives."<font size="2"> 
(Michael Tilby in </font><i><font size="2">Contemporary World Writers</font></i><font size="2">, 
ed.  Tracy Chevalier, 1993</font>) </p>

<p><i>Le Coq de bruyère </i>(1978), 
Tournier's first collection of short fictions, included also a play, 
<i>Le Fétichiste</i>.   
Some of the stories  
had been published individually in illustrated editions for children. 
The first rewrites Genesis; God is portrayed as a narcissist and Adam is bisexual before God creates Eve, his female half. 
'Amandine ou les deux jardins', 'La fugue du petit Poucet' and 
'Tupik' focused on children growing up in a restrictive environment.  
Tournier has not avoided dealing with taboo subjects, such as 
politics and sex, in his children's stories, and he had troubles in finding a publisher abroad for 
the picturebook <i>Pierrot ou les secrets de la nuit</i> (1979), 
which he called "a hymn to a physical contact" and "a lesson in love."  
However, its suggestive ending shocked even adult readers in France. <font size="2">
(<i>Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives</i>  
 by Sandra L. Beckett, 2008, p. 195)</font> In 1981, the book won the prize for best 
foreign children's book at the Leipzig Book Fair. 
</p>
<p>Tournier's fouth novel, <i>Gaspard, Melchior et Balthazar</i> (1980, The Four Wise Men) 
reworked the familiar Christian legend of the three kings who came to Bethlehem to honor 
the Messiah's birth. Taor, the fourth Magi, according to Russian myth, travelled from India. 
Taor did not reach Bethlehem in time, but rescued a group of children from the Massacre of the 
Innocents. The story weaves together realistic elements with the fantastic, and makes a 
groundbreaking move away from the formalism of the French nouveau roman. 
After the publication of <i>The Four Wise Men</i>,
Tournier was at the height of his career, considered to be France's
leading novelist. Dissatified with the novel &#8211; "I didn't go far
enough", he said &#8211; Tournier wrote a children's version, which came out
under the title <i>Les Rois Mages </i>(1983). The following adult
novel he did not rewrite for children, feeling that he has no need to
publish novels separately for adults and children. </p>
<p><i>Gilles et Jeanne</i> (1983) returned to the story of Joan of Arc
and her contemporary, the mass murderer Gilles de Rais. These opposite
characters meet in the first section. <i>La goutte d'or  </i>(1985)
was intended partly as an attack on France's racist attitudes toward
its North African migrant workers. It the poetic story about the plight
of these laborers the protagonist is Idris, a young Berber and a kind
of Friday figure. In the middle of the desert he meets a beautiful
white woman who takes a photo of him, promising to send it to Idris. He
waits for the picture in vain, and then decides to travel to France, to
find the woman. In Paris he experiences all the humiliations of an
outsider and faces the superficial world of pictures. To save himself
in the labyrinth of mirages, he starts to learn the art of calligraphy.
"Le signe est esprit, l'image est matière." <i>Le Médianoche amoureux</i>
(1989, The Midnight Love Feast) included a novella, short stories, and
short 'fables'. In the novella 'The Taciturn Lovers' examined the basic
psychological warfare between men and women: "What is a domestic scene?
It's the woman's triumph. It's when the woman has finally forced the
man out of her silence by her nagging. Then he shouts, he rages, he's
abusive, and the woman surrenders to being voluptuously steeped in this
verbal downpour." </p>

<p>Tournier was elected member of the Académie Goncourt in 1972.
Tournier's literary autobiography came out in 1977 under the title<i>  Le Vent Paraclet</i>.
Despite preferring to commute to Paris from his home only for business
or for literary activities, Tournier frequently visited schools and
corresponded with classes by tape cassette. In addition to novels,
Tournier has written essays, short stories, prose poems, the travel book<i> Le vagabond immobile</i>
(1984), and juvenile books. Several of his works have been illustrated
photographs taken by Edouard Boubat. Though an accomplished
photographer himself, Tournier has confined largely to portraits and to
nudes. <i>Eléazar, ou, la source et le buisson  </i>(1996) recounted
the journey of a family of 19th-century Irish settlers to a new home in
California and explores the question of God's refusal to allow Moses to
enter the Promised Land. Tournier's next work of fiction is said to be
a novel on Saint Sebastian. </p>
