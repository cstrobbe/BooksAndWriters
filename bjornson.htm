<p>Norwegian writer, editor, and theatre director, known with <a href="ibsen.htm">Henrik Ibsen</a>, <a href="kiella.htm">Alexander Kielland</a> and <a href="lie.htm">Jonas Lie</a>
as one of the "four great ones" of 19th-century Norwegian literature.
Bjørnson campaigned widely for liberal and national ideals, and became
an extremely popular national figure. He was awarded the Nobel Prize
for Literature in 1903. A friend and rival of Ibsen, he also wrote
plays of social realism. However, his fame since his death has
diminished in relation to Ibsen. </p>
<blockquote><font color="white"><b>--</b></font><b><font size="2">Knut Aakre tossed back his disorderly hair, his eyes darted fire, his whole frame appeared like a drawn bow. </font><br>
<font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2">"What sort of a
blessing this is that you speak of, I have already proved. It is of the
same character as all the others which you have brought to the parish,
namely, a doubtful one. True enough, you have provided us with a new
church; but, too, you have filled it with a new spirit . and not one of
love. True, you have made us new roads - but also new roads to
destruction, as is now plainly evident in the misfortunes of many.
True, you have lessened our taxes to the public; but, too, you have
increased those to ourselves; prosecutions, protests, and failures are
no blessing to a community.."</font></b><font size="2"> (from 'The Railway and the Churchyard')</font></blockquote>
<p>Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson was born in Kvikne, in northern Hedmark, the
son of Peder Bjørnson, a Lutheran pastor, and Elise Nordraak, a
merchant's daughter. In 1849 he went to Christiania (now Oslo) to
prepare for the university's entrance exams. He entered the university
in 1852 but soon abandoned his studies and joined the cultural scene.
He became a theatre and literary critic for the Christiania daily <i>Morgenbladet</i> and later edited <i>Illustreret Folkeblad</i>. </p>
<p>In 1857 Bjørnson succeeded Ibsen as director of the Norske Theater
in Bergen. He married in 1858 Karoline Reimers, an actress. Their son
Bjørn became an actor, and a daughter Bergljot married Ibsen's son
Sigurd. Bjørnson returned to Oslo in 1859 and worked for <i>Aftenbladet</i>,
where his liberal editorials finally led to his resignation. Bjørnson's
poem 'Ja, vi elsker dette landet' (Yes, We Love This Land ) from 1859
was later set to music by Rikard Nordraak (1842-1866) as the national
anthem of Norway. </p>

<p>To promote new theater and to safeguard its interests Ibsen and
Bjørnson organized in 1859 the 'Norwegian Society for Theater, Music,
and Language.' His first noteworthy stories Bjørnson wrote in the
late1850s. They were often set in the idyllic rural milieu, in which
the sun shines in a bright midsummer sky. Although he romantically
idealized peasants, he also depicted their everyday work and
festivities. His best works from this period include the short novel <em>Arne</em>, written in 1859. Its young protagonist, a poet, expressed much of Bjørnson&#8217;s own longing for faraway places. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Hans tanker blev stærkere og drev in i
visen: "Over de høje fjælle". Så snare hadde aldrig ordene været, ej
heller hadde de føjet sig så sikkert i lag; de var næsten som jænter,
der sat rundt på en haug. Han hadde et stykke papir hos sig, og han
skrev ned over sit knæ. Og da han hadde skrevet visen færdig, rejste
han sig som forløst, vilde ikke til folk, men tok skogvejen hjæmover,
skjønt han visste, at da måtte han ta natten med." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Arne</font></i><font size="2">, 1859) </font></blockquote>
<p>In the short story 'The Railway and the Churchyard' two friends are
separated by their different views of progress. Knut Aakre belongs to
an old and influential family. He is chairman of the parish
commissioners, but also protects his family interests. Contrary to his
secret wishes his neighbour Lars Hogstad supports a proposal to
establish a savings bank. The decision turn out to be far-sighted and
it brings prosperity to the parish. Years later Lars realizes that his
bank will fail if a new railway is not built&nbsp;&#8211; railway will raise
all real estate prices. Knut opposes in vain his plans to build it
through the old, now unused, churchyard, the only place it can go. Lars
sees the train working through the valley as a strong force, and
remembers his grandfather who raised the family from poverty to
comfortable circumstances. "... true, a part of his honour as a citizen
had been lost, but he had pushed forward, nevertheless. His faults were
those of his time; they were to be found on the uncertain borders of
the moral conceptions of that period, and are of no consideration now."
Sparks from the passing locomotive start a fire and burn down Lars's
house, but Knut is the first to help him. Lars is again elected the
chairman of the parish, but with Knut at his side.</p>
<p>In the much anthologized story 'The Father' Bjørnson again examined
the conflict between the public good and individual commitment. Thord
Overaas is the wealthiest and most influential person in the parish and
proud of his son. He meets the priest only when he is baptised, then
sixteen years later when he is confirmed &#8211; and the third time when he
is going to marry the richest girl of the region. When the priest
notices that Thord has not changed over the years he answers: "That is
because I have no troubles." Before the wedding his son drowns. Thord
sells half of his farm and gives the money to the poor. The priest
says: "I think your son has at last brought you a true blessing." </p>
<p>Between 1860 and 1863 Bjørnson lived abroad, mostly in Italy, and after his return was 
appointed director of the Christiania Theater (1865-1867). Since 1862, he began to receive an annual pension. 

From 1866 to 1871 he was editor of the <i>Norsk folkeblad</i>, which he made the mouthpiece for his ideas on political 
and social reform. Bjørnson's involvement in cultural and political battles marked his fiction, in which his urge 
to teach his readers occasionally guided his pen more than artistic aims. </p>
<p>As a playwright Bjørnson first gained notice in the late 1850s with historical dramas. Among his works were<em> Mellem Slagene</em> 
(1857),<em> Halte-Hulda </em>(1858), <em>Kong Sverre</em> (1861), <em>Sigurd Slembe</em> (1863), and&nbsp;<em>Maria Stuart i Skottland</em>&nbsp;(1864).
One of the central themes in his plays was the cultural continuity
between the pre-Christian Norway and modern day society. In the 1860s
he also published poetry, and from his <em>Digte og Sange</em> many poems were later set to music. Bjørnson's interest in the life of peasants was reflected in his novels <em>Synnøve Solbakken</em> (1857), and <em>En glad gut</em> (1860). While in Rome, he came under the influence of <a href="brandes.htm">Georg Brandes</a>. Bjørnson turned from folk themes to social questions and contemporary issues. The most successful of these was <em>En Fallit</em> (1875), which attacked dishonesty in business. </p>
<p>As an active participant in political and cultural battles, Bjørnson's views about church and 
religion were much debated. After reading Hippolyte Taine, Charles Darwin and others, he made known his 
rejection of formal religion. This and his political views brought against him a charge of high treason. 
In the 1870s and '80s, Bjørnson spent long times abroad and in 1881 he visited the United States. Although only a few of 
his works had been translated into English, false rumors spread through many 
German and American 
journals, that he planned to emigrate to the United States.

His best works from this and later periods include the 'problem' plays <em>Redaktøren</em> (1875), exploring journalism, <em>En Hanske</em> (1883), which led to a break between Bjørnson and Brandes, <em>Over Ævne</em> (1886), an attack on dogmatism, and the novels <em>Det flager i Byen og paa Havnen</em> (1892) and <em>Paa Guds Veje</em> (1889), both of which are concerned with the problems of heredity and education. <em>Paul Lange og Tora Parsberg</em> (1898) was based on the events surrounding the suicide of Ole Richter, one-time friend of the author. </p>
<p>In 1888 Bjørnson visited Finland &#8211; his first story about peasants
was translated into Finnish as early as in 1862. During this journey he
was received everywhere as a hero, and he met writers such as <a href="jaho.htm">Juhani Aho</a>, who wrote three long articles about his stay, and <a href="topelius.htm">Sakari Topelius</a>. On many occasions in the following years Bjørnson also expressed his support of Finland's struggle against Russification. <br>
</p>
      <p>While living in Grez-sur-Loing, on the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau,&nbsp; Bjørnson enjoyed being the center of the attention. He was
called the uncrowned King of Norway. In winter he sat at an open
window, wearing a&nbsp; wolf-skin coat and a Scottish tam-o-shanter.
Other members of the Scandinvian artists' colony included Carl Larson,
Jonas Lie, Karl Nordström, Ville Vallgren, and Anders Zorn. <br>
      </p>
      <p>His friendship with <a href="strindbe.htm">August Strindberg</a>, whom he met in Grez, eventually grew very sour. When Strindberg was threatened with blasphemy for his collection of short stories entitled<span style="font-style: italic;"> Getting Married</span> (1886),
Bjørnson first adviced him to go into exile ("This prosecution is the
biggest and best advertisement for the book," he wrote) and then urged
him to return to Sweden and face the charges. Strindberg's reply crushed Bjørnson's hopes that his younger colleague would be his ally:
"Your Majesty. I am in receipt of your Imperial decree and will have
the honour of completely ignoring it! . . . "I don't want any immoral
advice about returning home and making a spectacle of myself in order
to advertise my writings, which need no such assistance! Your former
friend, August Strindberg." <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1893 Bjørnson settled on a farm, travelling from there to
Denmark, France, Germany, and Italy. He wrote of the evils of
industrialization, defended oppressed minorities and joined <a href="ezola.htm">Emile Zola</a>
in the famous Dreyfus Affair. Although paralysed on one side, he
continued working until his death in Paris on April 26, 1910.
Bjørnson's novels in 13 volumes were published in an English
translation edited by Edmund Gosse between the years 1895 and 1909. </p>
