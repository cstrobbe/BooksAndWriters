<p>Russian poet, short story writer, novelist who wrote of the decay of
the Russian nobility and of peasant life. Ivan Bunin was awarded the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1933. He is considered one of the most
important figures in Russian literature before the Revolution of 1917.
Although Bunin wrote poetry throughout his creative life, he gained
fame chiefly for his prose works. Bunins calm "classical" style had a
closer kinship with the prose of the 19th-century &#8211; Turgenev, Tolstoy,
Gar&#353;in, Chekhov &#8211; than with the modernist experiments of his own time. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I have a genuinely savage hatred and genuinely savage contempt for revolutions."</b></font></blockquote>
<p>Ivan Bunin was born on his parents' estate near the village of
Voronezh, central Russia. His father came from a long line of landed
gentry &#8211; serf owners until emancipation. Bunin's grandfather was a
prosperous landowner, who started to spent his property after the death
of his young wife. What little was left, Bunin's father drank and
played at card tables. By the turn of the century the family's fortune
was nearly exhausted. In early childhood Bunin witnessed the increasing
impoverishment of his family, who were ultimately completely ruined
financially. Much of his childhood Bunin spent in the family estate in
Oryol province, where he became familiar with the life of the peasants.
In 1881 he entered the public school in Yelets, but after five years he
was forced to return home. Bunin's elder brother, who had studied at an
university and had sat in prison for political his activities,
encouraged him to write and read Russian classics, <a href="puskin.htm">Pushkin</a>, <a href="gogol.htm">Gogol</a>, Lermontov, and others. "Tolstoy is a greater writer than Dostoevsky," said Bunin once. "I have never liked Dostoevsky." </p>
<p>At the age of seventeen Bunin made his debut as a poet, when his
poem appeared in a magazine in St. Petersburg. He continued to write
verse and published in 1891 his first story, 'Derevenskiy eskiz'
(Country Sketch) in N.K. Mikhaylovsky's journal <i>Russkoye bogatstvo</i>.
In 1889 Bunin followed his brother to Kharkov, where he became a local
government clerk. Bunin then took a job as an assistant editor of the
newspaper <i>Orlovskiy Vestnik</i>, and worked as a librarian, and
district-court statistician at Poltava. Bunin contributed short stories
to various newspapers, and started a correspondence with <a href="tsehov.htm">Anton Chekhov</a>.
Bunin was also loosely connected with Gorky's Znahie group. In the
early 1890s, Bunin lived with Varvara Pashchenko, the daughter of a
doctor and an actress, who had been his classmate in Yelets. However,
she married Bunin's friend and died in 1918 of tuberculosis. Bunin
recalled his first love in the novella <em>Mitina Lubov'</em> (1925,
Mitya's Love), about a young man, Mitya, who is torn apart by his love
for Katia, an art student, who wants to keep her freedom. </p>
<p>Bunin admired the work of&nbsp; <a href="ltolstoi.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>,
but found impossible to follow the author's moral and sociopolitical
ideas. Bunin sent him letters and a pamphlet of his verse. His first
encounter with the forty-two years older Tolstoy was brief, and a
disappointment for him. "Bunin was very upset because he had spent so
little time with you," said Nikolai Leontiev to Tolstoy.&nbsp;In 1899
Bunin met <a href="gorki.htm">Maxim Gorky</a>, and dedicated his collection of poetry,&nbsp;<em>Listopad</em> (1901), for him. Bunin regularly visited Gorky at Capri from 1909 to 1913. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Like all wealthy Americans he was very
liberal when traveling, and believed in the complete sincerity and
good-will of those who so painstakingly fed him, served him day and
night, anticipating his slightest desire, protected him from dirt and
disturbance, hauled things for him, hailed carriers, and delivered his
luggage to hotels; So it was everywhere, and it had to be so at
Naples." </b></font><font size="2">(in 'The Gentleman from San Francisco', 1915) </font></blockquote>
<p>From 1895 Bunin divided his time between St. Petersburg and Moscow.
"I keep looking for a place where I could find some warmth but find
only hellish weather instead," he said to Gorky. Bunin traveled much,
married in 1898 Anna Tsakni, whom he left two years later; she was
pregnant at that time. By the turn of the century, Bunin had published
over 100 poems. He gained fame with such stories as 'On the Farm,' 'The
News From Home,' 'To the Edge of The World,' 'Antonov Apples', and 'The
Gentleman from San Francisco' (1915)<i>, </i>which depicts an American
millionaire who cares only about making money. He dies in a luxury
Italian hotel and is shipped home in the hold of a luxury liner.
Several tales focused on the life of peasants and landowners, but after
the revolution of 1905 Bunin's peasant themes took on a darker tone.
The author, who knew village life more closely than did the urban
intellectuals, considered the folk ignorant, violent, and totally unfit
to take a hand in government. Later he wrote about the Bolsheviks in
his notebook <i>Cursed Days: A Diary of Revolution</i>: "What a terrible gallery of convicts!"</p>
<p>As a translator Bunin was highly regarded. He published in 1898 a translation of <a href="long.htm">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>'s <i>The</i><i> Song of Hiawatha</i>,
for which he was awarded by the Russian Academy of Science the Pushkin
Prize in 1903. Bunin's other translations include Lord Byron's <i>Manfred</i> and <i>Cain</i>, Tennyson's <i>Lady Godiva</i>, and works from Alfred de Musset, and François Coppée. In 1909 the Academy elected Bunin one of its twelve members. 
</p>
<p>After Bunin's first marriage ended, his companion from 1907 was Vera
Muromtseva, but he continued to have affairs, most notably with Galina
Kuznetsova, his student, and Margarita Stepun, the sister of his
friend. Formally Bunin and Vera Muromtseva were married in 1922. Bunin
once regretted that he never met the heroine of <em>Anna Karenina</em>
in real life: "As far as I'm concerned, there is no more captivating
image of a woman than she," he confessed. "I could never &#8211; and still
cannot&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp; recall her without emotion. I am simply in love
with her." </p><p>At the age of 40, Bunin published his first full-length work, <em>Derevnia</em>
(1910, The Village), which was composed of brief episodes in the
Russian provinces at the time of the Revolution of 1905. The story, set
in the author's birthplace, was about two peasant brothers &#8211; one a
cruel drunk, the other a gentler, more sympathetic character. <i>The Village</i>
made Bunin famous in Russia. Bunin's realistic portrayal of village
life with its "characters sunk so far below the average of intelligence
as to be scarcely human" stirred much controversy. Later, after the
Revolutuion, work was also recommended by the Proletkult. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"These «ruthless» works caused passionate
discussions among our Russian critics and intellectuals who, owing to
numerous circumstances peculiar to Russian society and &#8211; in these
latter days &#8211; to sheer ignorance or political advantage, have
constantly idealized the people. In short, these works made me
notorious; this success has been confirmed by more recent works."</b> (in '</font><a href="http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1933/bunin-autobio.html"><font size="2">Autobiography</font></a><font size="2">') </font></blockquote>
<p>Bunin's&nbsp;<em>Sukhodol</em> (1912, Dry Valley) was a veiled
biography of his family, a eulogy to the the gentry estate. Before
World War I Bunin traveled in Ceylon, Palestine, Egypt, Turkey, and
other countries &#8211; these journeys provided much material for his poetry
and prose works. Between 1912 and 1914 Bunin spent three winters with
Gorky on Capri. </p><p>After revolution in October 1917, he left
Moscow and moved to Odessa for two years, eventually leaving Russia on
the last French ship to sail from Odessa. In Sofia he was robbed of his
academic gold medals and money; his wife lost her diamonds. He
emigrated to France, where he settled in Grasse. In the 1920 Bunin
published his diary&nbsp; <em>Okayannye dni</em>, where he bitterly
attacked the Bolshevik regime, and the Red Guard, which represented for
him anarchy and disorder. "Oh, how beastly this all is!" he wrote.
Other later works include the autobiographical novel <em>Zhizn arsen'eva: u istoka dnej</em> (1933, The Life of Arsenyev),<em> Temnye allei</em> (1946, Shadowed Paths), written during the Nazi occupation, and&nbsp; <em>Vospominaniya</em>&nbsp;(1950, Memories and Portraits). </p>
<p>In exile Bunin wrote only of Russia. Bunin had been frequently
mentioned as a possible Nobel winner, and the whole process had became
a burden for the author. In the émigré press, he was classified as a as
a representative of the literary past.&nbsp;<em></em>A new star had emerged to rival him &#8211; Vladimir Nabokov &#8211; and they were juxtaposed in a number of articles and interviews.</p>
      <p>According to a story, Bunin was stopped in Berlin on his way to Stockholm to receive prestigious award, which finally made
him into a world-wide celebrity. Nobel winner or not, he was arrested
by the Gestapo, interrogated&nbsp; &#8211;&nbsp; the excuse was jewel
smuggling &#8211; and he had to drink a dose of castor oil. Dissenting voices
suggested that the prize should have gone to Maxim Gorky. During World
War II Bunin, who was a strong opponent of Nazism, remained in France.
The Bunins sheltered Alexander Bakhrakh, a Jew in his house at Grasse
throughout the Occupation. He was well informed about the Jewish
customs. Parisian anti-Semites from the newspaper Renaissance called
him "the kike father". </p>
<p>Bunin died of a heart attack in a Paris attic flat on November 8, 1953. He was destitute after helping many Russian exiles. His projected trilogy, which began with <i>The Life of Arsenyev</i>,
was characterized by the Russian writer Konstantin Paustovski "neither
a short novel, nor a novel, nor a long short story, but is of a genre
yet unknown." The second part, LIKA, was published in 1939. Bunin
modified his views of the Soviet Union after World War II, and a
five-volume selection of his work&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in his native
country. <br>
