<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English poet, hymnist, and inventor of a
system of shorthand, student of religious mysticism. John Byrom's
light-hearted and good-natured character is apparent in his journals.
His shorthand was never widely used and it was too slow professional
stenographers. 'Hymn for Christmas Day', with its uplifting words, is
Byrom's best-known work. The phrase " Tweedledum and Tweedledee", about
a silly battle between two men, may have been coined by Byrom. As the
Tweedle boys, these names later appeared in <a href="lcarroll">Lewis
Carroll</a>'s <i>Through the Looking Class</i> (1871). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Some say, that Signor Bononcini, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Compared to Handel's a mere ninny; </font><br>
        <font size="2">Others aver, to him, that Handel </font><br>
        <font size="2">Is scarcely fit to hold a candle. </font><br>
        <font size="2">Strange! that such high dispute should be </font><br>
        <font size="2">'Twixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee. <br>
        </font></b><font size="2">('On the Feuds between Handel and
Bononcini') </font></blockquote>
      <p>John Byrom was born near Manchester into a family of
prosperous merchants and linendrapers. He was educated at Chester, and
later he went to Merchant Taylors' School. Byrom studied at Trinity
College, Cambridge, under the reign of Richard Bentley (1662-1742) <font face="Symbol">-</font> he ruled the college with such despotic power
that his mastership was a succession of quarrels and scandals. However,
Byrom defended Bentley. He may have addressed a pastoral published in
the <i>Spectator</i> in 1714 to the daughter of the master. The poem,
'Colin and Phoebe', became very popular. In Cambridge he became a
fellow. He also studied medicine at the University of Montpellier in
France. Though he did not take a degree and never practiced he was
afterward called 'doctor' by his friends. Byrom possibly spent some
time in France but chiefly he lived in Manchester. In 1721 Byrom
married his cousin, Elizabeth Byrom. </p>
      <p>While in Cambridge Byrom, invented his own system of
shorthand, and became its teacher. According to a story, Byrom made his
invention in a concert. His pupils, who called him the grand master,
were required to take an oath of secresy. Byrom's system was used by
John (1703-1791) and Charles Wesley (1707-1788), founders of Methodism,
who recorded their self-examinations in coded diaries. However, Timothy
Bright had been called the father of modern shorthand. Queen Elizabeth
granted him a patent for a "shorte and new kynde of writing by
character to the furtherance of good learning." Later on Samuel Pepys
(1633-1703) used the technique in his famous diary, so that no one
could read it while he was alive. William Mason first published his
system in 1672 under the title <i>Pen plucked from an Eagles Wing</i>;
it formed the basis of the Guerney system, used at least 200 years.
From 1724 Byrom was a fellow of Royal Society. His varied acquaintances
included the physician David Hartley, the Wesleys, devout Christians,
J. Butler, writer of <i>Fifteen Sermons</i>, and William Law
(1686-1761), of whom Byrom left accounts in his <i>P</i><i>rivate
Journal and Literary Remains</i> (1854-57). It is an important source
of information on Law, a very religious writer, whose
guide to the practice of Christian faith, <i>A Serious Call</i>,
influenced deeply <a href="samuelj.htm">Samuel Johnson</a>. </p>
      <p>Byrom's <i>Miscellaneous Poems</i> (1773) include some
modifications of Law's poem, and the well-known 'Hymn for Christmas Day'<b><font size="2"> </font><font size="2"> </font></b>(Christians awake,
salute the happy morn, / Whereon the saviour of the world was born) of
which Byrom is best remembered for. Originally the poem was written for
Byrom's daughter Dolly as a Christmas gift in 1749. A copy was given to
John Wainwright, an organist, who composed music for it. </p>
      <p>Most of Byrom's religious poems are now forgotten. In the
epigram on King and Pretender, Byrom showed his Jacobite
sympathies. The ambiguously loyal toast begins 'God bless the King! I
mean the Faith's Defender...' In 'On Clergymen Preaching Politics' he
wrote: "Were I a king (God bless me) I should hate / My chaplains
meddling with affairs of state; / Nor would my subjects, I should
think, be fond, / Whenever theirs the Bible went beyond."
Byrom also wrote religious verse and a pastoral (1714), he had many
varied linguistic, literary, religious, and scientific interests, and
was attracted to the mysticism of writers like Jacob Boehme and
Malebranche. Byrom contributed two papers on shorthand to the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> and copyrighted his 'tychygraphy' system in 1742, but
his <i>Universal English Shorthand </i>did not appear during his life
time. Byrom died in London on September 26, 1763. </p>

        <font size="2">
