<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French poet and Provençal patriot,
who shared with the Spanish dramatist <a href="eizaguir.htm">José
Echegaray</a> the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1904. Mistral received the prize for his contributions in
literature and philology. Mistral called himself 'humble écolier du
grand Homère', a humble student of Homer &#8211; his passionate odes to sun,
to his native Provençe, and its people, had much in common with the
mediaeval troubadour poetry, but the literary language of the
troubadours should not be confused with Modern Provençal. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"Thus my yearliest childhood
was spent on the farm in the company of plowmen, harvesters, and
shepherds. And sometimes, when some bourgeois happened by the farm, one
of those who affected to speak only French, I was abashed and even
humiliated to see my parents suddenly became respectful toward him, as
if he was superior to them."</strong> (in <em>The Memoirs of Fréderick
Mistral</em>, 1906, tr. George Wickes) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Frédéric Mistral was born in Maillaine, a village in the Rhone
Valley of southern France. The family had lived on their own land from
one generation to the next. Mistral's father, a prosperous farmer and a
former soldier in the French Revolution, was left widower by his first
wife. At the age of fifty-five he married Estève Poulinet, the daughter
of the mayor;&nbsp;Frédéric was their only son, born on the 8th of
September 1830. "Although our neighbors scorn us as "frog-eaters," the
people of Maillane have always believed that there is no prettier
village under the cope of heaven," Mistral wrote in his book of
memoirs. </p>
      <p>In his early years Mistral developed a passionate attachment
to the language of his region, Provençal, known also as <i>langue d'oc</i>,
in contrast to <i>langue d'oïl</i> of the north. He was educated at
the College Royal of Avignon, where he read Homer and Virgil. While
still at school he started to write&nbsp;verse in Provençal, his mother
tongue. Already at that time, Mistral's great&nbsp;ambition was to
become a poet, but his father wanted him to finish his studies. <span class="st"><span class="ft">Deeply affected by the Revolution of 1848,
he&nbsp;published a song in French that was published in the little
newspapers of Arles and Avignon: "Awake, you children of Gironde, /
Stir and quicken in your cold tombs; /&nbsp;Freedom will rejuvenate the
world&#8212;/ Eternal war against kings!" </span></span>After receiving his
law degree in 1851 from the University of Aix-en-Provence, Mistral
started his literary career. </p>
      <p>Mistral wrote his early works in France. His poems attracted
attention when they were published in <i>Li Provençalo</i> (1852), an
anthology edited by his former teacher Joseph Roumanille (1818-1891).
On May 21, in 1854 he founded with Roumanille, Jean Brunet, Paul Piera,
Anselme Mathieu, Alphonse Tavan and Théodore Aubanel an association, <i>félibres,
      </i>for the maintenance of language and customs of Provençe. The
group started to publish an annual journal, <i>Armana Prouvençau</i>.
His motto to the Association of Provençal Poets was: "Lou soulèu me fai
canta" (The sun makes me sing).</p>
      <p>Mistral's pastoral epic <em>Mirèio </em>(1859) was a major
contribution to the Provençal literary movement. The work greatly
helped to arise awareness of genuine Provençal language. Mistal had
shown the manuscript to the poet and politician Alphonse de Lamartine
(1790-1869), whose enthusiasms paved way for its success. Michel Carré
based his libretto&nbsp;for Charles Gounod's opera, <em>Mireille</em>
(1865), on the poem. </p>
      <p>The central characters in this long poem in 12 cantos are
young lovers, Mirèio, a girl from an old and prosperous peasant family,
and Vincèn, a young boy without any property. Mirèio's parents do not
approve their marriage, and rival suitors are making Vincèn's life
miserable. Finally Mirèio escapes to search help from Provençal patron
saints. She gets a sunstroke while crossing a barren country (la Crau).
Just before her death, she sees in the chapel of the pilgrimage site a
heavenly boat with the saints coming to take her with them. </p>
      <p>After his breakthrough as a poet, Mistral returned from Paris
to Maillane. He lived there until his death, first with his mother,
then with his wife, Mile Marie Rivière, whom he married in 1876.
Mistral devoted 20 years' work to the scholarly dictionary of
Provençial, entitled <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Lou Tresor
dóu Felibrige</em><strong> </strong></span></span>
(The Treasury of Félibres). This work, in which Mistral attempted to
create a new literary standard for the language, was issued between
1880 and 1886. The dictionary contains all the dialects of the language
and a wealth of Provençal folklore, traditions, and beliefs. There is
also a translation of Genesis into Provençal prose. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The rhythm of this poem has beauty
and harmony, and its artistic composition succeeds on all counts. The
source from which Mistral has drawn is not psychology; it is nature.
Man himself is treated purely as a child of nature. Let other poets
sound the depths of the human soul!"</b> </font><font size="2">(</font><font size="2">C. D. af Wirsén, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy,
in his Nobel Prize presentation 1904) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Mistral's third poem was about the last days of the popes in
Avignon, <em>Nerto</em>&nbsp;&#8211; the work received the Prix Vitet. His
admires compared him to Ariosto and organized banquets and festives in
his honor in Paris. According to a story, Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull
with several other Indians visited him when they were touring Europe.
Aside from journeys to Paris, and a&nbsp;trip to Switzerland and
another to Italy, Mistral rarely left his beloved region. <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>La Réino Jano</em></span></span>,
Mistral's only drama, was published in 1890. His last great epic
was&nbsp; <em>Lou Pouèmo dou Rose</em>&nbsp;(1897). It depicted the
life of the Rhône boatmen before the advent of the steamship. </p>
      <p>Among Mistral's other works are his memoirs <em>Moun
espelido: memòri e raconte</em> (1906) and<em> Lis óulivado</em>&nbsp;(1912),
a collection of short lyric poems. Mistral died at Maillane on March
24, 1914. Posthumously appeared three volumes of&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Prose
d'almanach</em></span> (1926-30). It's French translation opposite the
Provençal text was made by Mistral; usually the French translations
accompanying his original works were by the author himself. The
proceeds of the Nobel prize Mistral used to develop his museum of
ethnography which he had founded in Arles. </p>
