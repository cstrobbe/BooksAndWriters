<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; --><font face="Times New Roman"></font>French novelist, best known for <i>À la recherche du temps perdu</i>
(Remembrance of Things Past), his autobiographical novel told mostly in
a stream-of-consciousness style. The work collected pieces from
Proust's childhood, observations of aristocratic life-style, gossip,
recollections of the closed world, where the author never found his
place. The key scene is when a madeleine cake (a small, rich
cookie-like pastry) enables the narrator to experience the past
completely as a simultaneous part of his present existence:<br></p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"And suddenly the memory revealed
itself: The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on
Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out
before mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my
aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or
tisane."</strong> (from <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>) </font></blockquote>
<p>Marcel Proust was born in Auteuil, near Paris, the son of an eminent
doctor, Adrien Proust, and his wife, Jeanne Weil, who was from a
well-to-do Alsatian Jewish family. The village of Auteuil, where Proust
spent his holidays as a child, was described in an 1855 guidebook as
"out of a comic opera." Later Auteuil and Illiers became the Combray of
<i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>. Proust was baptized as Catholic, but
he never practiced the religion. From 1882 to 1889 Proust attended the
Lycée Condorcet, where he felt isolated and misunderstood. "We were
rough with him," recalled one of his classmates. In spite of his severe
asthma, from which he had suffered since childhood, Proust did his one
year military service at Orléans. </p><p>Proust studied law at the
famous Sorbonne at the École des Sciences Politiques. He contributed to
Symbolist magazines and frequented the salons of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, the wealthy and aristocratic area of Paris. During the
late summer of 1895 he started to write <em>Jean Santeuil</em>, which he later abandoned. In 1896 his first books appeared: <em>Portraits de peintres</em> and <em>Les plaisirs et les jours</em>, with drawings by Madeleine Lemaire. Proust's unpublished texts from this period, <i>Jean Santeuil</i> and <em>Contre Sainte-Beuve</em>, an attack on the biographical criticism of Sainte-Beuve, were discovered in the 1950s.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It seems that the taste for books grows
with intelligence, a little below it but on the same stem, as every
passion is accomplished by a predilection for that which surrounds its
object, which has an affinity for it, which in its absence still speaks
of it. So, the great writers, during those hours when they are not in
direct communication with their thought, delight in the society of
books. Besides, is it not chiefly for them that they have been written;
do they not disclose to them a thousand beauties, which remain hidden
to the masses?"</b> (Proust in <i>Reading in Bed</i>, selected and edited by Steven Gilbar, 1995)</font></blockquote>
<p>From 1895 to 1899 Proust worked on an autobiographical novel that
remained unfinished. In 1899 he started to translate the English art
critic John Ruskin, without knowing much English. His earliest love
affairs, which had been heterosexual, changed later into homosexual
affairs. Among them was Alfred Agostelli, who was married and was
killed in an air accident.</p><p>According to some sources, Proust
frequented Le Cuziat's male brothel, but although these details have
fascinated his biographers, they have shed little light on his on his
literary accomplishments. To the age of 35 Proust lived the life of a
snob and social climber in the <i>salons</i>. For a short time he worked as a lawyer and was active in the Dreyfuss affair, like <a href="ezola.htm">Émile Zola</a> and other artists and intellectuals.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A great part &#8211; perhaps the greatest &#8211; of
Proust's writing is intended to show the havoc wrought in and round us
by Time; and he succeeded amazingly not only in suggesting to the
reader, but in making him actually feel, the universal decay invincibly
creeping over everything and everybody with a kind of epic and horrible
power." </b>(Georges Lemaitre in <i>Four French Novelists</i>, 1938)</font></blockquote>
<p>Throughout his life Proust suffered from asthma. He was looked after
by his Jewish mother, to whom the writer was &#8211; neurotically &#8211; attached.
After the death of his father in 1903 and mother in 1905, Proust
withdrew gradually from high-society circles. Until 1919 Proust lived
in a soundproof flat, at the 102 Boulevard Haussmann, where he devoted
himself to writing and introspection. When <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>
met Proust at a midnight supper in the fashionable Majestic Hotel in
May 1922, the two great innovative writers did not speak more than a
few words with each other. "Of course the situation was impossible,"
Joyce recalled later. "Proust's day was just beginning. Mine was at an
end." </p>
<p>Proust was financially independent and free to start on his great novel, <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>,
which was influenced by the autobiographies of Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe and François Chateaubriand. From 1910 he spent much time in his
bedroom, often sleeping in the day and working at night. "For a long
time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out my
candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say
to myself: "I'm falling asleep. And half an hour later the thought that
it was time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would make as if to put
away the book which I imagined was still in my hands, and to blow out
the light; I had gone on thinking, while I was asleep, about what I had
just been reading, but these thoughts had taken a rather peculiar turn;
it seemed to me that I myself was the immediate subject of my book: a
church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V." </p>
<p>In 1912 Proust produced the first volume of his seven-part major work, <i>À la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i>
(Remembrance of Things Past). The massive story of 3 000 pages occupied
the last decade of his life. As a half Jew, he knew what it is to be an
outsider, the observed. As an onlooker in society, he turned his wordly
experiences into inner experience. Being a Jew and a homosexual at the
same time, Proust was involved in both of the most fashionable "vices"
of the contemporary French society, which he, "the greatest witness of
dejudaized Judaism" interconnected in the "darkest comparison which
ever&nbsp; has been made on behalf of Western Judaism." <font size="-1">('Marcel Proust, Temoin du Judaisme dejudaize,' by  J. E. van Praag, </font><font size="-1">in <span style="font-style: italic;">Revue Juive 
de Geneve</span>, 1937).</font></p>
      <p> <i>Du côté de chez Swann</i> (Swann's Way) was printed at
Proust's own expense in 1913, after Andre Gide advised the Gallimard
publishing house to reject it. <i>Swann's Way</i> gained a modest
success. Gide made later an offer to publish the subsequent volumes.
Another famous writer, E.M. Forster, had his doubts about the whole
work: "The book is chaotic, ill constructed, it has and will have no
external shape; and yet it hangs together because it is stitched
internally, because it contains rhythm." <font size="2">(from <i>Aspects of the Novel</i>, 1927)</font>
The second volume, which was delayed by the WW I, appeared in 1919, but
the next parts made Proust finally internationally famous. He was still
correcting the typescript on his deathbed, but did not manage to finish
the final volumes before his death on November 18, 1922. </p>

<p><i>Remembrance of Things Past</i> does not have a clear and continuous plot line. 
The first two sections can be &#8211; and often are &#8211; read separately. Marcel, 
the narrator is not Proust but resembles him in many ways. 
Marcel is initially ignorant <font face="Times New Roman">&#8211;</font>
only slowly does he begin to grasp the essence of the hidden reality.
Through a series of loves and disillusionments he finds his true
vocation in life. At the end he is preparing to write a novel which is
like the one just presented to the reader. Marcel's childhood memories
start to flow when he tastes a madeleine cake dipped in linden tea such
as he was given as a child.</p><p>"And
as soon as I had recognised the taste of the piece of madeleine soaked
in her decoction of lime-blossom which my aunt used to give me
(although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of
why this memory made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon
the street, where her room was, rose up like a stage set to attach
itself to the little pavilion opening on to the garden which had been
built out behind it for my parents (the isolated segment which until
that moment had been all that I could see); and with the house the
town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the Square where I
used to be sent before lunch, the streets along which I used to run
errands, the country roads we took when it was fine." </p>
<p>Memory takes the central role in the novel and apparently
insignificant details prove to be the most important. The first part
focuses on Marcel's childhood in Combray. Proust follows the lives of
three families, Marcel's own, the aristocratic de Guermantes, and the
family of the Jewish Bohemian dilettante Swann. Among the central
characters are the faithless cocotte Odette, whom Swann marries,
homosexual Baron de Charlus, partly modelled on Count Robert de
Montesquiou-Ferensac (1855-1921), an art critic, poet, and essayist,
Dutchess, Mme de Villeparisis, Robert Saint-Loup, and Marcel's great
love Albertine, who is perhaps lesbian and who dies in a riding
accident. The character was partly based on Alfred Agostinelli,
Proust's chauffeur, secretary and live-in companion. Proust gradually
deepens the portraits of his characters &#8211; Vinteuil, a modest piano
teacher, turns out to be a great composer. In the climax of the novel
the narrator fails to recognize many of his friends because they have
changed so much physically during the years. Marcel realizes that his
vocation as an artist is to capture the past still alive within us. And
being was for Proust the complete past, "that past which already
extended so far down and which I was bearing so painfully within me."
In the narration past and present merge, reality appears in
half-forgotten experiences, and parts of the past are felt differently
at different times. </p>
<p>Proust is generally considered a pioneer of the modern novel. He
made a clear distinction between man and work. The writer is a man of
intuition. "A book is the product of a different self from the one we
manifest in our habits, our social life and our vices," Proust wrote in
his answer to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, who tried to understand
writers by investigating their private life and environment. </p><p>Proust's
work widely influenced authors in different countries, among them
Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. His style of long sentences, some of
which extend to several pages in length, paved the way for Claude
Simon's narrative inventions. Proust later said that he had from the
beginning a fixed structure for the whole novel. In the construction he
used photographs; the author himself had a penchant for being
photographed in uniform. One biographer mentions that Proust liked
tight underwear. </p>
<p>Proust's literary criticism did not attract wide attention until 1954, when <em>Contre Sainte-Beuve</em>
came out. He admired Vigny, Hugo, and Leconte de Lisle, but Baudelaire
was for him the greatest poet of the nineteenth century. Proust denied
Henri Bergson's influence on his work, although they both were much
occupied with time and memory, emphasizing <i>duration</i> &#8211; time
lived every day rather than clock time. The most famous of Proust's
essays is that on Flaubert's style, in which he compares Flaubert's
grammatical use of tenses to Kant's revolution in philosophy. A
prolific writer, Proust also was an avid letter writer. </p>
