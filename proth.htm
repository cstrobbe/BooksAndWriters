<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American novelist and
short story writer. Philip Roth first achieved fame with <span style="font-style: italic;">Goodbye, Columbus</span>
(1959), which consisted of a novella and five short stories and
described the life of a of Jewish middle-class family. Ten years later
appeared <span style="font-style: italic;">Portnoy's Complaint</span>.
In this "masturbation story" the narrator searches for freedom by using
sex as his way of escape. The book gained a great international success.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Between first discovering the
Newark
Bears and the Brooklyn Dodgers at seven or eight and first looking into
Conrad's Lord Jim at age eighteen, I had done some growing up. I am
only saying that my discovery of literature, and fiction particularly,
and the 'love affair' </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><font size="2"><b>
to some degree hopeless, but still earnest </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><font size="2"><b> that has ensued, derives in part from this childhood
infatuation with baseball. Or, more accurately perhaps, baseball </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><font size="2"><b>
with its lore and legends, its cultural power, its seasonal
associations, its native authenticity, its simple rules and transparent
strategies, its longueurs and thrills, its spaciousness, its
suspensefulness, its heroics, its nuances, its lingo, its 'characters',
its peculiarly hypnotic tedium, its mythic transformation of the
immediate </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><font size="2"><b> was
the literature of my boyhood."</b> (Roth in 'My Baseball Years', from </font><i><font size="2">Reading Myself and Others</font></i><font size="2">, 1975)</font></blockquote>
<p>Philip Roth was born in Newark, New Jersey, which became the
scene for his early novels. His father, Herman Roth, was an insurance
salesman of Austro-Hungarian stock. Later in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Patrimony </span>(1991)
Roth portrayed his eighty-six-year-old father, who suffered from a
brain tumor, but who still in his early eighties "had no difficulty
convincing the wealthy widows... that he had only just reached
seventy."&nbsp; Roth's mother Bess (née Finkel) died in 1981; her life
revolved around caring for her family. <br>
</p>
<p>Roth attended Rutgers University for a year before
transferring to Bucknell University. He studied at the University of
Chicago, receiving his M.A. in English. In 1955 Roth joined the army,
but was discharged after an injury during his basic training period.
Roth continued his studies in Chicago, and worked from 1955 to 1957 as
an English teacher. He dropped out of the Ph.D. program in 1959 and
started to write film reviews for the <span style="font-style: italic;">New
Republic</span>. <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>, which won the National Book
Award, was later adapted to the screen, like several other of Roth's
novels. <br>
<br>
Roth's third novel, <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i>, became in 1969 the
number one best-seller and marked a turning point in the author's
career. The inspiration behind Portnoy has been variously attributed to
Lenny Bruce's nightclub act. Roth records the intimate confessions of
Alexander Portnoy to his psychiatrist. He goes through his adolescent
obsession with masturbation and his relationship with his
over-possessive mother, Sophie. "Then came adolescence&nbsp;&#8211; half my
waking life spent locked behind the bathroom door, firing my wad down
the toilet bowl, or into the soiled clothes in the laundry hamper, or <i>splat</i>,
up against the medicine-chest mirror, before which I stood in my
dropped drawers so I could see how it looked coming out." Portnoy's
approach to hedonistic Western culture is ironic. Although he is
successful, he knows that his achievements are only temporal. Many
readers found the book offensive and pornographic because of its sex
scenes. Roth's presentation of the Jewish mother was also criticized. </p>
<p>Jewishness has been Roth's major territory in his examination
of the American culture. From Malamud and <a href="bellow.htm">Bellow</a>,
his older colleagues, Roth has differed in a more ironic&nbsp;&#8211;
sometimes characterized as "less loving"&nbsp;&#8211; view of the lives of
the Jews. Often the readers have identified the writer himself with the
obsessions of his fictional characters, and accused him of sharing
their thoughts. "Publishing a book is like taking a suitcase and
putting it out in a public place and walking away and leaving it
there," Roth has said in an interview. "There is no way a writer can
control what happens to his book when it is out in the world." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Mein Leben als Philip Roth</font></i><font size="2">, dir.&nbsp; Christa Maerker, 1998, e-Motion-Picture/SWR) </font></p>
<p>From
1960s Roth has worked at the State University of Iowa, Princeton, the
State University of New York, the University of Pennsylvania and
elsewhere. Since 1988 he was Distinguished Professor at Hunter College,
New York. Roth's several awards include the Guggenheim fellowship
(1959), the National Book Award (1960, 1995), the Rockefeller
fellowship (1966), the National Book Critics Circle award (1988, 1992),
and the PEN/Faulkner Award (1993, 2000). In 1998 Roth received the
National Medal of Arts at the White House, and in 2001 he received the
highest award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Gold
Medal in fiction. In 2011 Roth won the fourth Man Booker International
Prize, worth £60,000.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Roth has&nbsp;constantly wrestled with the problem of the
identity of the Jewish-American male. <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Breast</span> (1972) made a humorous allusion to Kafka's famous short
story 'Metamorphosis'&nbsp;&#8211; Roth's hero, David Kepesh, finds himself
transformed into a massive female breast. Kepesh appears also in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Professor of Desire</span> (1977),
which chronicled his life to the age of 34, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dying Animal </span>(2001),
in which he has an affair with his student. "This novel &#8211; which takes
its title from Yeats's lines, "Consume my heart away; sick with desire
/ And fastened to a dying animal"&nbsp;&#8211; wants to address the big
subjects of mortality and the emotional fallout of the 1960s, but after
the large social canvas of Mr. Roth's post-war trilogy ("American
Pastoral," "I Married a Communist" and "The Human Stain"), it feels
curiously flimsy and synthetic." <font size="2">(Michico Kakutani in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, May 8, 2001)</font>
<br>
</p>
<p>Another veteran character, Nathan Zuckerman, is involved in
several love affairs in <span style="font-style: italic;">My Life as a
Man</span> (1975). He has appeared as the author's mouthpiece in
subsequent novels, including <span style="font-style: italic;">I
Married a Communist</span> (1998), set in the1950s. The novels deals
with divorce, the cold war, and the McCarthy-era witch hunts. Through
Zuckerman Roth has explored the relationship between a fictional
character and its creator, or the process of aging, as in the
melancholic novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Exit Ghost </span>(2007),
Roth's last novel featuring his fictional alter ego. In an interview in
November 2012 set to promote the release of the French edition of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Nemesis</span> (2010), Roth said that that
he won&#8217;t write any more books.<br>
</p>
<p>Sometimes Roth views his own life as a part of his fiction. In
<span style="font-style: italic;">The Plot Against America</span>
(2004), an alternate history, in which the famous pilot Charles
Lindbergh is the 33rd President of the fascist U.S., Philip Roth is one
of the characters, suffering from his Jewish background. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Operation Shylock</span> (1993)
Roth meets a doppelganger, the other Philip Roth, a man, who claims to
be the author. A true incident inspired the story: the novelist Richard
Elman had recalled in his book his seduction of a beautiful actress and
his upset the next morning when he learns that she thought he was
Philip Roth. Elman allowed her to leave unenlightened. Another subject
in the book was John Demjanjuk's trial&nbsp;&#8211; the man alleged to be
Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka. Demjanjuk claimed that he had had a
doppelganger, who had committed all the crimes he was accused of and
murdered Jews in concentration camps. </p>
<p>Roth's memoir of his family,<i> Patrimony</i>, won the
National Critics Circle Award in 1992. A <i>Time</i> reviewer called <span style="font-style: italic;">Sabbath Theater</span> (1995), about a
retired puppeteer, one of the best-written works of 1995; it won the
National Book Award. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Human Stain</span>
(2000) was set in the 1990s at the height of the Clinton sex-scandal.
The narrator is Zuckerman who tells about Coleman Silk, the dean of a
small college. He is forced to resign after alarming the guardians of
politically correct usage. "Does anyone know these people?" he asks
about two students who never showed up for class. "Do they exist or are
they spooks?" They do, and turn out to be African Americans. And
off-campus, with the help of Viagra, Silk starts an affair with an
illiterate janitor, Faunia. "Most novelists wouldn't or couldn't handle
the variety of elements that Roth does here. Few have his radical
imagination and technical mastery. Fewer still have his daring." <font size="2">(R.Z. Sheppard in </font><i><font size="2">Time</font></i><font size="2">, May 22, 2000)</font>
Robert Benton's film version of the book from 2003, starring Anthony
Hopkins and Nicole Kidman, was adapted for the screen by Nicholas
Meyer. </p>
<p>Roth's first wife was Margaret Martinson Williams; they
separated in
1963.&nbsp;In 1990 he&nbsp;married the distinguished Shakespearean
actress Claire Bloom&nbsp;&#8211; their relationship had already started in
the 1970s. The couple divided their time between homes in Connecticut
and London. Their neighboring friends in Connecticut&nbsp;included
Arthur Miller and William Styron. After they separated Bloom published
her memoir <i>Leaving a Doll's House</i> (1996). Her 1982 memoir, <i>Limelight
and After</i>,
centered on her early years and particularly the collaboration with
Chaplin. Bloom has acted in several classic and modern plays, including
<i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> and<i> The Cherry Orchard</i>.
Films: <i>Limelight</i> (written and directed by Charles Chaplin,
1952), <i>Look back in Anger</i> (directed by&nbsp; Tony Richardson,
play John Osborne, 1959), <i>A Doll's House</i> (as Nora, play Henrik
Ibsen, directed by Patrick Garland, 1973), <i>Islands in the Stream</i>
(based on Ernest Hemingway's novel, directed by Franklin Schaffner,
1977), <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i> (written and directed by Woody
Allen, 1989). Television dramas: <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>, <i>Shadowlands</i>,
<i>Shadow on the Sun</i>. </p>
