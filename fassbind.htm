<p>Controversial and prolific German director 
and playwright, who attracted attention with his politically committed 
and disillusioned stage plays and films.&nbsp;Most of his 
plays&nbsp;Fassbinder wrote between 1968-1971 for his own "anti-theatre" in Munchen. Among the best-known of his films&nbsp;are <i>The Marriage of Maria Braun</i> (1979), <i>Berlin Alexanderpatz </i>(1980), which was&nbsp;adapted for television from Alfred Döblin's novel, and <i>Effi Briest </i>(1974),&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Theodore Fontane's novel.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"To show the narrative on film is like
the author telling a story, but there's a difference. When one reads a
book, one creates&nbsp;&#8211; as a reader&nbsp;&#8211; one's own images, but when
a story is told on screen in pictures, then it is concrete and really
"complete" One is not creative as a member of a film audience, and it
was this passivity that I tried to counter in </b></font><b><i><font size="2">Effi Brief</font></i><font size="2">.
I would prefer people to "read" the film. It's a film which one cannot
simple experience, and which doesn't attack the audience... one has to
read it. That's the most significant thing about the film."</font></b><font size="2"> (Fassbinder in </font><i><font size="2">Fassbinder</font></i><font size="2">, edited by Tony Rayns, 1976) </font></blockquote>

<p>Rainer Werner Fassbinder was born in Bad Wörishofen into a bourgeois
family. Soon after his birth, his parents, Dr. Helmut Fassbinder and
Liselotte Pempeit Fassbinder,&nbsp;moved to Munich. When he was five,
his parents divorced, and his father moved to Cologne. Fassbinder was
raised by his mother, who&nbsp;worked&nbsp;as a translator. She was
hospitalized in 1950 with tuberculosis, and later on, when
she&nbsp;spent&nbsp;long periods&nbsp;in the hospital, Fassbinder was
looked after by his relatives, friends, and neighbours. </p><p>Fassbinder
attended Munich's Theresiengymnasium and then the&nbsp;St. Anna
Gymnasium, a boarding school in Augsburg and the Realgymnasium. While
attending a night school, he lived with his father in Cologne in the
early 1960s.&nbsp;In his youth, Fassbinder started to attend movies
compulsively. After dropping out of school, he worked in odd jobs,
traveled in France, and visited brothels in North Africa. </p><p>Before
entering the Fridl Leonhard drama school, where he met Hanna Schygulla
and Irm Hermann,&nbsp;Fassbinder took private acting lessons from Max
Krauss, a director.&nbsp;He failed the State Examination for Actors,
but his play, <em>Just One Slice of Bread: Dialogue for an Auschwitz Film</em>,
shared a third prize in a drama competition at the Junge Akademie in
Munich. Fassbinder's enrollment at the Berlin Film School was turned
down after a week of entrance&nbsp;exams. In 1967 he made a second
unsuccesful attempt to enter the school. This time, he wasn't even
allowed to take the test. </p><p>His acting career Fassbinder began in
a fringe theatre in Munich. Peer Raben and some&nbsp;other members of
the Action-Theater, which he had joined in 1967, worked off and on with
Fassbinder until his death. When the Action-Theatre closed, Fassbinder
established an "antitheater." In 1969 he wrote three plays, made four
films, and acted in several films. After a relationship with Günter
Kaufmann, an actor, he married the actress and singer Ingrid Caven, one
of his leading ladies; they divorced in 1972. <i>Pre-Paradise Sorry Now</i>,
Fassbinder's play from this period, was based on an actual murder case,
committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in the English moors. In <i>Bremen Freedom</i>, also based on historical events, a woman systematically eliminates the men and women who are on her way. </p>
<p>In the late 1960s Fassbinder started to work with the cinema under
the influence of Jean-Luc Godard, but also American gangster movies and
the work of Howard Hawks, John Huston, and Raoul Walsh fascinated him. <i>Love Is Colder Than Death</i>
(1969) was a crime film, which connected everyday oppression people
experience with criminal actions. "What you are left with when you've
seen this movie isn't that six people were murdered, that a few deaths
occurred, but that these were poor people who didn't know what to do
with themselves, who were simply plopped down as they were, and weren't
given the option - no, let's not go too far here&nbsp;&#8211; who simply
don't have any options."&nbsp;<font size="2">(Fassbinder in </font><i><font size="2">The Anarchy of the Imagination</font></i><font size="2">, 1992) </font></p><p>During
his most prolific period between 1969 and 1976, Fassbinder made theatre
productions in Munich, Bremen, Bochum, Nuremberg, Berlin, Hamburg, and
Frankfurt. In additions, he did four radio plays, and took roles in
other director's films, including the title part in Volker
Schlöndorff's <a href="brecht.htm">Brecht</a> adaptation <i>Baal</i>
(1969). Sometimes Fassbinder appeared under the pseudonym Fitz in his
own films as well as those of others. Brecht's influence is seen in a
number of Fassbinder's works, among them <i>Effi Briest,</i> in which
the director's aim was to create in the spirit of Brecht's "alienation
effect," a distance between the audience and what is happening on the
screen.&nbsp;"Through that built-in 'distance,' the audience has a
chance to discover its own attitude to society," Fassbinder explained. </p>

<p>In 1971 Fassbinder&nbsp;established Tango-Film Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Its first film was <em>The Merchant of Four Seasons</em>
(1972), starring Hans Hirschmüller, Irm Hermann and Hanna Schygulla.
From the beginning of his career, Fassbinder operated with a group of
close friends. "The cinema was the family life I never had at home,"<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->
he once said. Fassbinder's friends characterized the director
'lunatico', irresponsible, ironic, mean, and very generous. In his
first film Fassbinder&nbsp;used the name&nbsp;Franz Walsch&nbsp;&#8211;
referring both to Raoul Walsh and Franz Biberkopf, the central
character of Döblin's <em>Berlin Alexanderplatz</em> &#8211; the director
first read the book when he was fourteen. Fassbinder's mother was in
his second amateur short. She later acted in many films under the name
of Lilo Pempeit and began in 1971 to oversee the financial affairs of
"antiteater" and "antiteater-X-Film", which Fassbinder had created in
1969. </p><p>After breaking up with Kaufmann, Fassbinder began a
relatioship with El Hedi ben Salem M'Barek Mohamed Mustafa,
who&nbsp;acted in <em>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul</em> (1974). The film was inspired by Douglas Sirk's <em>All That Heaven Allows</em>
(1955), starring Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson. Fassbinder had met Salem
in Pari &#8211;&nbsp;he was ten years older and had a wife and two children
in Morocco. Armin Meier, a former butcher, was Fassbinder&nbsp;lover
&nbsp;from 1974 to 1878; he committed suicide in their joint apartment
by taking an overdose of sleeping pills.&nbsp;The film <em>In a Year of Thirteen Moons</em> (1978) was dedicated to Armin Meier's menory. In 1978 Fassbinder began life with the film editor Juliane Lorenz. </p><p>Fassbinder's
scripts were unpolished, the dialogue mannered, the camera set-ups
static, and the décor sparse, but&nbsp;the impact of the scenes was
spellbinding.&nbsp;Though Fassbinder's production schedules were
furious, he&nbsp;took his work seriously, and was devasted when he
failed to receive the main prize for <em>The Marriage of Maria Brown</em> at the Berlin Film Festival in 1978. <i>Veronika&nbsp;Voss</i>
won the Golden Bear at the 1982 Berlin Festival but
often&nbsp;Fassbinder's films&nbsp;provoked hostile reactions among
cinema audiences. As a creator of social melodramas&nbsp;he owed much
to Douglas Sirk, who&nbsp;made in Hollywood&nbsp;enjoyable and personal
films from ridiculous scripts. But in&nbsp;contrast to Hollywood
cinema, he preferred unhappy endings. </p><p>Much of Fassbinder's work was financed by television. The most famous among his over 40 full-length films are <i>The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant</i> (1972), <i>The Marriage of Maria Braun</i> (1979), <i>Lola </i>(1981), <i>Veronika Voss </i>(1982), and fourteen-part television film <i>Berlin Alexanderplaz</i>
(1980), Fassbinder's masterpiece. Between 1977 and 1979 Fassbinder
directed three of his most personal films, that touched his own
problems and the situation in Germany, when terrorism was rising. <em>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul</em>
told the story of Ali, a garage mechanic from Morocco, and a lonely
widowed cleaning lady, Emmi, who is much older than he. Despite the
hostility that surrounds them, they marry and face the racial and other
prejudices. Ali tells&nbsp;Emmi that "fear eats the soul" is an often
used Arab phrase. The actor himself died in 1982 in a&nbsp;prison,
where he hanged himself. <i>Deutchland im Herbst </i>(1978) showed how terrorism grows from disappointments in private life. <i>In einem Jahren mit 13. Monden </i>(1978) focused on the transsexual Erwin/Elvira; it was a desperate cry in life when death in the only solution. In&nbsp;<i>Die Dritte Generation </i>(1979)
a computer sales man finances a group of terrorists. Fassbinder's own
opinions about terrorism were ambivalent&nbsp;&#8211; he knew Holger Meins
and Horst Söhnlein, both members of the RAF and showed understanding to
their political goals but criticized armed violence. In general,
political scandals were not the material of his films, but&nbsp;the
dialectical relationship between oppressors and oppressed. </p>

<p>Fassbinder's <em>Berlin Alexanderplatz </em>was Balzacian in its
scope &#8211; a fifteen-and-a-half-hour epic, made for German television.
Alfred Döblin's famous novel had been performed as a radio play some
years earlier, in 1976. The story traced the life of Franz Biberkopf,
who tries to lead what he thinks is an honest existence. He is
surrounded by thieves, whores, pimps, killers, and Nazis. Elisabeth
Trissenaar, Hanna Schygulla, and Barbara Sukowa were his girlfriends,
the elegant score was by Peer Raben and cinematography by Xavier
Schwartzenberger. </p>


<p>Fassbinder dealt with relations that are based on violence,
falseness, and oppression. He saw New Germany heartless, materialistic
and intolerant. Although he was homosexual, he is perhaps best
remembered by his fascinating female figures. Hanna
Schygulla&nbsp;became Fassbinder's diva, whom he put up on a pedestal
and who rose into world fame like Marlene Dietrich rose from&nbsp;Josef
von Sternberg's films. Women were for&nbsp;Fassbinder symbols of
different social, political and ideological situations. Veronica Voss,
Lola, Maria Braun and others reflected his view that women are ruled
the men and their values. According to Fassbinder, the stronger exploit
the weaker,&nbsp; and "love is colder than death."&nbsp; </p>

<p>Fast living and fast working Fassbinder died of drug overdose in
Munich, at the age of 36, on June 10, 1982, in his apartment in
Clemensstraße 76. He was completing the cutting of <i>Querelle</i>,
based on Jean Genet's play and dedicated to El Hedi ben Salem.
Set&nbsp;in an artifical Brest&nbsp;harbour milioeu,&nbsp;the story
tells of a French sailor who discovers his true homosexual nature in an
infamous whorehouse. This film was rejected even by Fassbinder's
admirers and&nbsp;marked symbolically the end of the most experimental
period of the German cinema since the 1920s. At the time of his death,
Fassbinder was working on an adaptation of a novel entitled <em>Cocaine </em>and a life of Rosa Luxemburg. </p>
