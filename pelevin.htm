      <p>Novelist and short story writer, a member of the perestroika
and
post-Soviet generation of authors, who turned away from conventional
realistic prose in favor of postmodern artistic devices. Pelevin's
kaleidoscopic play with styles, philosophical problems, ideals, and
national myths and refusal to explain his work have earned him a
reputation as a controversial but nevertheless thought-provoking voice
on the Russian literary scene. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"My father's plans on my behalf
failed to inspire me with any real confidence</b></font><b><font face="Symbol" size="2">-</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">after
all, he himself was a Party man, and he had a perfectly good Russian
name, Matvei, but all he had earned for his efforts was a miserly
pension and a lonely, drunken old age</font><font size="2">." </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><font size="2"><i>Omon Ra</i></font><font size="2">, 1992) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Viktor Pelevin was born in Moscow, where he was brought up in
a Soviet <i>nomenklatura</i>
family. His father Oleg was a military officer but not a Party member;
he died in 1999. Pelevin's mother Zina was an economist. </p>
      <p>Pelevin spent his summer vacations on a Moscow army base and
later
recalled that it "was like a big playground full of soldiers." However,
he was never interested in a career in the Army. At the age of 14
Pelevin read Bulgakov's <i>The Master and Margarita</i> in a library
during school hours. Although the novel had gone through censorship,
and had lots of omissions, the unexplainableness of it all offered a
liberating experience which had a primary influence on Pelevin's
thought. </p>
      <p>To avoid the military service, Pelevin entered the Moscow
Institute
of Power Engineering, where he took part in a secret project to protect
MiG fighter planes from flying insects. Pelevin then studied the
Moscow&#8217;s Gorky Institute of Literature. Before becoming a full-time
writer, he worked in a design office and as an editor of <i>Science
and Religion </i>magazine. </p>
      <p>In his early twenties, inspired by <a href="/castane.htm">Carlos
Castaneda</a>'s
writings, which circulated in samizdat copies in Russia, Pelevin also
tried to grow a peyote cactus, without much success. "This plant needs
a lot of sun radiation and a special kind of soil to produce the amount
of mescaline sufficient to summon his noble spirit," Pelevin later
wrote. "So, despite the fact that the number of buttons I ate would
have made Don Juan whistle in respectful disbelief, the result was nil,
or very close to it". </p>
      <p>Pelevin's first collection of prose, <i>The Blue Lantern </i>(1991),
won the Little Booker Prize for Short Stories in 1993 and established
him as one of the most interesting writers in Russian postmodernism. In
the short story ''Problema vervolka v srednei polose' (1993) Pelevin
suggested, that werewolves helped the Bolsheviks to win the White Army.
      <br>
      </p>
      <p>The title of his first novel, <i>Omon Ra </i>(1992),
combined the Russian word for "special
police forces" with the name the ancient
Egyptian sun god. In this post-Soviet fantasy, Pelevin made a parallel
with a search for
freedom and a suicide mission mentality. Noteworthy, he has admitted
that before writing the novel, he did no research on the Soviet space
programme, one of the national achievements of which the USSR was most
proud. The naive narrator, Omon Krivomazov
has always dreamed of the outer space, his escape to the fact that his
country was "just a series of crumby little rooms, which smelled of
garbage". Eventually he is selected to the cosmonaut program and adopts
the code name Omon Ra. Omon's mission is to fly a supposedly "unmanned"
spacecraft to the dark side of the moon. Because
he cannot return after
landing, he is ordered to commit suicide. From outside the moonwalker
looks like a large laundry tank and its steering mechanism is built
from a bicycle. "We just didn't have the time to defeat the West
technologically," explains Colonel Urchagin. But it turns out, that the
whole story of the glorious Soviet space program is a fabrication. When
all illusions are dispelled, there is nothing but emptiness. Some
critics have found the ending flat and insipid which only accentuates
Pelevin's stand that perhaps all roads lead "nowhere". Nevertheless,
the novel made a profound contribution to the revival of the
anti-totalitarian satire. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The central themes in Pelevin's work are the nature of
reality, the
relationship between phenomena and observation, and the sense of
identity, as in <i>The Sacred Book of the Werewolf</i>, in which the
heroine looks like a 14-year-old girl but is actually some 2,000 years
old werefox named A Hu-Li; her name means in Chinese "the fox named A".
"Ludwig Wittgenstein once said that names are the only thing that exist
in the world," states the narrator. "Maybe that's true, but the problem
is that as time passes by, names do not remain the same &#8211; even it they
don't change." <br>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing is what it seems to be in <i>Chapaev i Pustota</i>
(1996, The Clay Machine-Gun), in which the story takes place in two
realms. In one, the
narrator Pyotr Voyd, a decadent poet, tells of his travels with the
legendary Bolshevik
commander Vasily Ivanovich Chapaev, a real historical figure, who died
during the Russian Civil
War. In the other realm Pyotr is a patient in a mental institution, and
describes his fantasies to the psychiatrist. As Petka he is Chapaev's
faihful sword-bearer. Chapaev is portrayed as a
Buddhist guru and a hallucination; in Soviet propaganda he was hailed
as an illiterate "genius of military art." Pyotr's "psychological
journal" could be read as a reminder of Gogol's 'Diary of a Madman'.
"Nothing
there exists, so to speak,
in reality," Pelevin writes. "Everything depends on who is looking at
it." There is no difference between reality and nightmare, "it's all a
dream." The chairman of the jury for the Russian Booker Prize
eliminated
the novel from the competition on the grounds that "works like this act
like a cultural virus &#8211; they destroy the cultural memory". </p>
      <p><i>The Life of Insects</i> (1997) reflects the Buddhist
thought that
nature is a kind of spiritual embryo that is present in within all
beings. The Kafkaesque novel consist of fifteen interlock stories, in
which the characters seem to exist simultaneously both as human beings
and different species of insects in a multilayered spacetime. A father,
a scarab, tells his son that there is nothing but dung. "And the
purpose of life is to push it along in front of you." Then he is
crushed under a huge red shoe with a stiletto heel. Natalia, a young
fly, asks the visiting American mosquito Samuel Sacker, what he was
doing in France. "The usual thing, sucking blood," Sam replies. "That's
not what I meant. Did you go just because you felt like it?" Not
exactly. Some friends invited me to the annual Proust festival in
Combray." </p>
      <p>Pelevin's cult best seller <i>Generation "P"</i> (1999), a
satire of
contemporary Russia and the children of Marx, Pepsi and TV, who in fact
chose Pepsi "precisely the same way as their parents chose Brezhnev."
Pelevin follows the adventures of Babylen Tatarsky in the advertisement
business, which appears as surrealistic as Babylen's acid trips, where
there is no difference between virtual reality and the actual world.
The hero's first name was composed by his father from the ideals of
communism and the sixties, from Yevtushenko's famous poem 'Baby Yar'
and Lenin. In an interview Pelevin has said, that Generation Pizdets
"means a generation that faces catastrophe" <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The Observer</font></i><font size="2">, April 30, 2000). </font>The
"P" in title also refers to an obscene Russian word, "pizdets". </p>
      <p>The outside world was completely shut off in <i>Shlem uzhasa</i>
(2005), in which the characters are virtual voices in cyberspace
labyrinth, trying to figure out if are they dead or alive, and
realizing soon that somebody is monitoring their conversation. The
titular helmet is a not a hat or apparatus, but a mind, "the place
where everything else is produced out of nothing." In his introduction
Pelevin writes, "If a mind is like a computer, perhaps myths are its
shell programs: set of rules that we follow in our world processing,
mental matrices we project onto complex events to endow them with
meaning." </p>
      <p><i>Empire "V"</i> (2006) was about the initiation of a young
man
into the spiritual life of vampires and their language. The title
refers to the era of Vampire Rule, to distinguish it from the nazi
Third Reich and "the Fourth Rome of globalism". The human race serve as
a milk-cow to these superhumans, providing them nourishment, a kind of
drung called <i>bablos</i>. This essence is distilled from money
circulation. </p>
      <p>Pelevin has visited South Korea several times, and stayed
there in a
Buddhist monastery. "Part of the attraction of Buddhism for me is that
it enables me to empty my head of all the junk of modern living,"
Pelevin has said in an interview <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, January 23,
2000)</font>.
Pelevin avoids literary circles, rarely gives interviews, at least in
his own country, and keeps his personal life private. Although typecast
as a postmodernist by many critics, Pelevin himself has rejected this
label. The critic Aleksandr Arkhangel'sky declared in his review of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chapaev i Pustota</span>, that Pelevin's
postmodernist games are banishing genuine feelings and destroying
Russian national culture and identity. A
pro-Putin youth group organized in 2002 "book exchanges" in the street
where works by controversial writers, including Pelevin and <a href="/sorokin.htm">Vladimir Sorokin</a>, could be traded for
"wholesome" ones by the former socialist realist writer Boris Vasil'ev,
who in turn dissociated himself from this demonstration.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>As an
experimental writer with a penchant for science fiction themes and the
surreal Pelevin has been compared to Sorokin, whose work is however
more nihilistic and provocative. Dina Khapaeva has argued in <span style="font-style: italic;">Nightmare: From Literary Experiments to
Cultural Projects</span> (2013) that Pelevin carries on the legacy of
Gogol in his experiments with nightmares. In Viktor Dotsenko's book <i>Voina
Beshenogo</i> (1999),
one of his many novel's about the nationalistic action hero Mad
Dog, "Viktor Poverin" is smeared as a propagandist of drug use. <br>
