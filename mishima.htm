      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific writer, who is considered
by many
critics as the most important Japanese novelist of the 20th century.
Mishima's works include 40 novels, poetry, essays, and modern Kabuki
and Noh dramas. He was three times nominated for the Nobel Prize for
literature. Among his masterpieces is <i>The Temple of the Golden
Pavilion</i> (1956). The tetralogy <i>The Sea of Fertility</i>
(1965-70) is regarded by many as Mishima's most lasting achievement. As
a writer Mishima drew inspiration from pre-modern literature, both
Japanese and Western. Mishima ended his brilliant literary career by
suicide in 1970. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"How oddly situated a man is apt to
find
himself at the age of thirty-eight! His youth belongs to the distant
past. Yet the period of memory beginning with the end of youth and
extending to the present has left him not a single vivid impression.
And therefore he persists in feeling that nothing more than a fragile
barrier separates him from his youth. He is forever hearing with the
utmost clarity the sounds of this neighboring domain, but there is no
way to penetrate the barrier."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Runaway
Horses</font></i><font size="2">, 1969) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Yukio Mishima was born Kimitaka Hiraoka in Tokyo, the son of a
government official. Later he changed his name into Yukio Mishima so
that his anti-literary father, Azusa, wouldn't know he wrote. The name
Yukio can loosely be translated as "Man who chronicals reason." On his
father's side Mishima's forebears were peasants, but his ambitious
grandfather eventually climbed to the position of the governor of the
Japanese colony on the island of Sakhalin. Mishima's mother, Shizue
Hashi, came from a family of educators and scholars. </p>
      <p>Mishima was raised mainly by his paternal grandmother, Natsu
Nagai, a cultured but unstable woman from a samurai family, who hardly
allowed the boy out of her sight. During World War II Mishima was
excused military service, but he served in a factory. This plagued
Mishima throughout his life <font face="Symbol">-</font> he had
survived shamefully when so many others had been killed. "I believe one
should die young in his age," wrote Mishima's friend, the writer
Hasuda, who committed suicide after the war. In February 1944, Mishima
received a silver watch from Emperor Hirohito's own hand at the
graduation ceremony &#8211; "he was splendid, you know, the emperor was
magnificent on that day", Mishima later said. </p>
      <p>Mishima entered in 1944 Tokyo University, where he studed law,
and
then worked as a civil servant in the finance ministry for eight months
before devoting himself entirely to writing. Mishima's first book, <i>Hanazakari</i>
(1944), a pastiche of decorative classical prose, appeared when he was
just 19-year-old. In 1946 Mishima met Kawabata Yasunari, who
recommended Mishima's stories to important magazines. His first major
work, <i>Confessions of a Mask</i> (1949), dealt with his discovery of
his own homosexuality. The narrator concludes, that he would have to
wear a mask of 'normality' before other people to protect himself from
social scorn. Mishima admired Oscar Wilde, of whom he published an
essay in 1950. </p>
      <p>The largely autobiographical work reflected Mishima's
masochistic
fantasies. His preoccupation with the body, its beauty and
degeneration, marked several of his later novels. Mishima wished to
create for himself a perfect body that age could not make ugly. He
started body building in 1955 and he also became an expert in the
martial arts of karate and kendo. Perhaps preparing for his death,
Mishima liked to pose in photographs as a drowned shipwrecked sailor,
St. Sebastian shot death with arrows, or a samurai committing ritual
suicide. In 1960 he played a doomed yakuza, Takeo, in Yasuzo Masumura's
film <i>Karakkaze Yaro </i>(Afraid to Die). At the end Takeo is
killed, dying in a stairway. Many of Mishima's later short stories and
novels delt with the theme of suicide and violent death. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>''Let us remember that the central
reality must be sought in the writer's work: it is what the writer
chose to write, or was compelled to write, that finally matters. And
certainly Mishima's carefully premeditated death is part of his work.''</b>
(</font><i><font size="2">Mishima: A Vision of the Void </font></i><font size="2"> by Marguerite Yourcenar, 1985) </font></blockquote>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ai no kawaki</span> (1950,
Thirst for Love), written under the influence of the French writer <a href="mauriac.htm">François Mauriac</a>, was a story about a woman who
has become the mistress of her late husband's father. <span style="font-style: italic;">Kinkakuji </span>(1956,
The Temple of the Golden Pavilion) was based on an actual event of
1950. It depicted the burning of the celebrated temple of Kyoto by a
young Buddhist monk, who is angered at his own physical ugliness, and
prevents the famous temple from falling into foreign hands during the
American occupation. "My solitude grew more and more obese, like a
pig." (from <i>Temple of the Golden Pavilion</i>) </p>
      <p><i>The Sound of Waves</i> (1954) has been filmed several
times. The
story, set in a remote fishing village, tells of a young fisherman,
Shinji, who meets on the beach a beautiful pearl diver, Hatsue, the
daughter of Miyata, the most powerful man in the village. Hatsue is
loved by another young man, Yasuo. Miyata forbids Hatsue to continue
seeing Shinji, but when Shinji shows his courage during a storm, he
finally gives him and his daughter his blessing. The first film version
from 1954, directed by Senkichi Taniguchi, was shot on location in the
Shima Peninsula in Mie Prefecture, home of Japan's famous women pearl
divers. </p>
      <p>Mishima's reputation in Japan started to decline in the 1960s
although in other countries his works were highly acclaimed. This
decade and the next have been characterized as something of a Golden
Age in the translation of Japanese fiction into English. Donald Keene,
who translated several of Mishima's plays and the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Utage no ato</span> (1960, After the
Banquet), developed a lifelong friendship with the author. <span style="font-style: italic;">Kinu to meisatsu </span>(1964, Silk and
Insight), which John Nathan politely refused to translate (saying that
the "I don't think I could make it work in English"), dealt again lost
ideals, but this time the story was set in the world of silk textile
manufacturing and was based on a real strike that took place in 1954,
at the textile manufacturer Omi Kenshi. The central characters are an
old-fashioned factory owner, Komazawa, and a manipulating political
operator, Okano. Also <i>After the Banquet</i>, set behind the scene
of politics, drew from real-life occurrences and provoked a legal suit
for violating privacy. </p>
      <p>Mishima was deeply attracted to the patriotism of imperial
Japan, and samurai spirit of Japan's past. However, at the same time he
dressed in Western clothes and lived in a Western-style house. In 1968
he founded the Shield Society (Tate no Kai), a private army of some 100
youths in uniforms worked on de Gaulle's uniform, who were dedicated to
a revival of Bushido, the samurai knightly code of honour. In 1970 he
seized control in military headquarters in Tokyo, trying to rouse the
nation to pre-war nationalist heroic ideals. His <i>coup d'état</i>
was doomed from the beginninbg. On November 25, after failure, Mishima
committed seppuku (ritual disembowelment) with his sword within the
compounds of the Ground Self-Defense Force. Before he died he shouted,
''Long live the Emperor.'' As he fell on the carpet, he was beheaded by
one of his men, acting as a <i>kaishaku</i>, the one who delivers the
decapitating sword-blow. After his death, Mishima's wife had the
negative of <i>Patriotism</i> (1966) burned, a film in which Mishima
played the leading role and committed suicide at the end.</p>
      <p>On the day of his death Mishima delivered to his publishers
the final pages of <i>Tennin Gosui </i>(The Sea of Fertility<i>)</i>,
the authors account of the Japanese experience in the 20th century.
Mishima based the theme on the Buddhist idea of the transmigration of
the soul. The first part of the four-volume novel, <i>Spring Snow</i>
(1968), is set in the closed circles of Tokyo's Imperial Court in 1912.
It was followed by <i>Runaway Horses</i> (1969), <i>The Temple of Dawn</i>
(1970) and <i>Five Signs of a God's Decay</i>
(1971). Each of the novels depict a different reincarnation of the same
being, Honda, who dies at the age of twenty: first as a young
aristocrat, then as a political fanatic in the 1930s, as a Thai
princess before and after World War II, and as an evil young orphan in
the 1960s. The<i> tennin</i> in the tetralogy's Japanese title refers
to a supernatural being Buddhist theology, who has similarities with
the Christian angel but who is mortal. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Just let matters slide. How much
better
to accept each sweet drop of the honey that was Time, than to stoop to
the vulgarity latent in every decision. However grave the matter at
hand might be, if one neglected it for long enough, the act of neglect
itself would begin to affect the situation, and someone else would
emerge as an ally. Such was Count Ayakura's version of political
theory."</b> (From </font><i><font size="2">Spring Snow</font></i><font size="2">, 1968) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In his plays Mishima showed interest in the traditional
Japanese
theater and Western themes. His dramas, written for the Western style
theatre, include <i>Rokumeikan</i> (1956), which deals with a ball
given for the Emperor's birthday, <i>Tenth Day Chrysanthemum</i>
(1961), <i>Madame de Sade</i>
(1965), an effort to see Marquis de Sade through women's eyes
(noteworthy, the real hero of the play never appears on the stage), <i>The
Fall of the House Suzaku</i> (1967), and <i>My Friend Hitler</i>
(1969). Mishima wrote several Kabuki pieces. His last work,<i> The Moon
Like a Drawn Bow</i>, was performed in 1969 at the National
Theatre. The play ended with scene of a <i>seppuku</i>. Mishima was
considered to be in his time the only living author talented enough to
write Kabuki plays in traditional style.</p>
