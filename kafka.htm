      <p>Czech-born German-speaking writer whose posthumously published
novels express the alienation of 20th century man. Kafka's nightmares
of dehumanization, bureaucratic labyrinths, and totalitarian society
have much in common with the works of George Orwell (<i>Nineteen
Eighty-Four</i>, 1949; <i>Animal Farm</i>, 1955). <a href="jlborges.htm">Jorge Luis Borges</a>
has noted, that Zeno's paradox against motion and the arrow and
Achilles are the first Kafkaesque characters in literature. Kafka's ill
health was also an important biographical factor behind the fear of
physical and mental collapse dramatized in such short stories as "Ein
Hungerkünstler" (1924) and "Die Verwandlung" (1915, The Metamorphosis).</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a
gigantic insect..." </b>(from "The Metamorphosis") </font></blockquote>
      <p>Franz Kafka was born in Prague, now in the Czech Republic but
then
part of Austria. His father was Hermann Kafka, an owner of a large dry
goods establishment, and mother Julie (Löwy) Kafka, who belonged to one
of the leading families in the German-speaking, German-cultured Jewish
circles of Prague. Hermann Kafka was a domestic tyrant, who directed
his anger against his son. Kafka also had three sisters, all of whom
perished in Nazi camps. Often Kafka's stories dealt with the struggle
between father and son, or a scorned individual's pleading innocence in
front of remote figures of authority. In <i>Letter to His Father</i>
(1919) Kafka admitted: "My writing was all about you; all I did there,
after all, was to bemoan what I could not bemoan upon your breast. It
was an intentionally long-drawn-out leave-taking from you." </p>
      <p>Kafka grew up in an atmosphere of familial tensions and social
rejection that he experienced as a member of Prague's Jewish minority.
His attitude to his Jewish heritage was ambivalent. In a diary he
wrote: ''What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in
common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content
that I can breathe.'' Kafka was educated at the German National and
Civic Elementary School and the German National Humanistic Gymnasium.
In 1901 he entered Ferdinand-Karls University, where he studied law and
received a doctorate in 1906. During these years Kafka became a member
of a circle of intellectuals, which included Franz Werfel, Oskar Baum
and Max Brod, whom Kafka met in 1902. About 1904 Kafka began writing,
making reports on industrial accidents and health hazard in the office
by day, and writing stories by night. His profession marked the formal,
legalistic language of his stories which avoided all sentimentality and
moral interpretations &#8211; all conclusions are left to the reader. </p>
      <p>Until his retirement Kafka worked at the insurance business
(1907-23), first at an administrative position in a Prague branch of an
Italian insurance company and then at the Workmen's Accident Insurance
Institute of Prague. His work was highly valued at the company and
during World War I his supervisors arranged for his draft deferment. </p>
      <p>During his life Kafka had many girlfriends, many affairs, and
a number of broken engagements. In 1912 he met Felice Bauer, a
twenty-four-year-old businesswoman from Berlin. He warned her that life
with him would mean ''a monastic life side by side with a man who is
fretful, melancholy, untalkative, dissatisfied and sickly.'' Their
relationship lasted for five years. Felice later moved to the United
States, where she died in 1960. Kafka's first creative period started
with such short stories as "Das Urteil" (The Judgment) and "Die
Verwandlung", in which Gregor Samsa, a literary descendant of <a href="gogol.htm">Gogol</a>'s
Akakii Akakievich, wakes to find out that he has turned overnight into
a giant insect. He remains trapped in his room by his petit bourgeois
family. His father throws an apple core at Gregor, it rots, and Gregor
dies. </p>
      <p>World War I stopped Kafka's productivity as a novelist and
short
story writer, but he continued to write letters and diaries. In
notebooks, which he started to keep in 1910, Kafka recorded his
literary ideas, dreams, everyday occurrences and experiences. Theater
and films he had seen were an important part of his life. After he had
seen a Yiddish theater troupe perform in a café he wrote: "The sympathy
we have for these actors who are so good, who earn nothing and who do
not get nearly enough gratitude and fame is really only sympathy for
the sad fate of many noble strivings, above all of our own." </p>
      <p>In 1914 Kafka began his second novel, <em>Der Process</em>
(The Trial) and wrote the short story "In der Strafkolonie," which was
one of the few works published in Kafka's lifetime. <i>The Trial </i>depicted
the hopeless attempts of Josef K. to survive nightmarish events, that
start at his breakfast table. "Someone must have been spreading lies
about Josef K., for without having done anything wrong he was arrested
one morning." Josef K. denies his guilt, and starts endless
investigations of the court system. But there is no truth and he dies
"like a dog." In the story "In der Strafkolonie" the truth is the
function of an instrument of torture, a machine that kills its victims
by writing the nature of their crime upon their body. </p>
      <p>Kafka's characters are punished or threatened with punishment
even
before they have offended the authorities. "You may object that it is
not a trial at all; you are quite right, for it is only a trial if I
recognize it as such," one of the characters explains in <i>The Trial</i>.
The book starts with the famous words: "Someone must have traduced
Joseph K. for without having done anything wrong he was arrested one
fine morning." Joseph K. encounters the merciless effects of law but no
identifiable lawgiver, a theme Kafka further developed in the
unfinished novel <em>Das Schloss</em> (1926, The Castle). In the final
chapter two men&nbsp;&#8211; according to some critics symbols of his
testicles&nbsp;&#8211; take Joseph away and execute him stabbing him through
the heart. </p>
      <p>In August 1917 Kafka discovered that he had contracted
tuberculosis.
He spent ten months with his sister Ottla in the Bohemian village of
Zuerau. In 1919 he was hospitalized because of influenza. Kafka spent
increasing periods of time on leave in various rural sanatoriums. He
fell in love with Milena Jesenská, a twenty-four-year-old writer, who
had translated some of his stories into Czech. After they separated she
worked as a journalist and became a Resistance hero. Jesenská died in a
German concentration camp in 1944. Later Margarete Buber-Neumann
depicted her in <i>Kafkas Freundin Milena</i> (1963). Kafka's fear of
sexuality was probably the main reason for his decision to leave
Milena. He had written in 1913 in his diary "Der Coitus als Bestrafung
des Glückes des Beisammenseins" and in the winter 1920-21 he stopped
sending her regular letters. </p>
      <p>After their relationship ended, Kafka wrote his last novel, <i>The
Castle</i>,
where K. arrives at a village, claiming to be a land surveyor. "The
Castle hill was hidden, veiled in mist and darkness, nor was there even
a glimmer of light to show that the castle was there." K. tries to
obtain recognition of his status as the officially appointed land
surveyor to the Castle, a mysterious domain that rules over the
village. K wants to meet Klamm, the castle superior. His assistants,
Arthur and Jeremiah, are not helping. K. makes love to the barmaid
Frieda, a former mistress of Klamm. Frieda leaves K. when she discovers
that he is merely using her. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Aber auch Ihnen dürfte doch schon
die
Lückenlosigkeit der amtlichen Organisation aufgefallen sein. Aus dieser
Lückenlosigkeit aber ergibt sich, dass jeder, der irgendein Anliegen
hat oder aus sonstigen Gründen über etwas verhört werden muss, sofort,
ohne Zögern, meistens sogar noch ehe er selbst die Sache zurechtgelegt
hat, ja, noch ehe er selbstr von ihr weiss, schon die Vorladung
erhält." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Das Schloss</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Kafka retired in 1922 on a pension. Next year he met on the
Baltic
Dora Diamant, a twenty-five old woman from an Orthodox Jewish family,
who worked in the kitchen of a holiday camp. Kafka's illness released
him from the daily responsibilities of bourgeois life but also cut his
income&nbsp;&#8211; his parents sent him provisions and money from Prague.
Kafka, who wrote letters busily, was occasionally forced to send
postcards because he did not have money for the letter post. His health
rapidly deteriorated. In 1924 Kafka moved with Dora to the Kierling
Sanatorium outside Vienna. When he proposed marriage and wrote to
Dora's father, the reply was "no". However, later Dora described
herself as "the wife of Franz Kafka." Dora survived Nazi Germany,
Stalin's Russia, and World War II. She died in London in 1952. </p>
      <p>Kafka spent in the sanatorium the last six weeks of his life.
He
suffered from thirst and in his last letter to his parents he
recollects his childhood when he drank beer with his father during
their visits to a bathing establishment. Kafka died of tuberculosis on
June 3, 1924. His unfinished novel, <em>Der Verschollene</em>(retitled
Amerika), was published in 1927. Kafka never visited the United States
but his protagonist, the 17-year-old Karl Rossmann, enters New York
Harbor as an immigrant and sees the Statue of Liberty, who holds in her
hand not a lamp but a sword. Karl's picaresque adventures lead him to a
theater and to the company of other castaways. Walter Benjamin noted in
1934 in his essay on Kafka that "While in the earlier novels the author
never addressed himself otherwise than with a mumbled initial, here he
experiences a rebirth on a new continent with a full name." Kafka
managed to write six chapters but it is open to discussions how he
planned to end the novel. </p>
      <p>As a Jew Kafka was isolated from the German community in
Prague, but
his friend and biographer Max Brod (1884-1968) did his best to promote
Kafka's career as a writer. However, Kafka published only a few
stories. During the last two and half years of his life Kafka finished
some of his best works. Among them were "Ein Hungerkünstler", in which
the hero is left to die unwatched in his unusual profession, and
"Josephine, die Sängerin", in which the central character is a mouse,
who sings&nbsp;&#8211; or squeaks. Kafka requested before his death that all
his manuscripts should be destroyed, an act of self annihilation, which
has been regarded as an evidence, that he was not in sound mind at that
time. "Of all my writings the only books that count&nbsp; are these: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Judgment</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Stoker</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Metamorphosis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Penal Colony</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Country Doctor</span>, and the short
story: <span style="font-style: italic;">Hunger-Artist</span>," he
wrote to Max Brod, well aware that his friend would disregard his wish.
Brod published the unfinished novels <i>The Trial</i>, <i>The Castle</i>,
and <i>America</i>, classics of modern fiction.</p>
