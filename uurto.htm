<p>Finnish novelist, poet and playwright, who continued the female literary tradition&nbsp;of <a href="jotuni.htm">Maria Jotuni</a>, <a href="lonerva.htm">L. Onerva</a>, and <a href="akallas.htm">Aino Kallas</a>.
Among the central themes in Uurto's work are gender relations and
marriage problems. In her own time Uurto's novels were considered
daring&nbsp;&#8211; they dealt with such taboo subjects as women's sexuality
and abort. Her major novel was <em>Ruumiin viisaus</em> (1942), in
which the author sought liberation from the shackles of intellect and
male dominance in marriage.&nbsp;Coming to terms with her erotic
feelings, the protagonist leaves her husband. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">"<b>Lea katsahti h‰nen pahastuneisiin
hartioihinsa, kuljeskeli edestakaisin laitellen astioita pˆyt‰‰n ja
nyrpisteli nen‰‰ns‰: En voi itselleni mit‰‰n. En ole aina sama. Toisina
hetkin‰ pid‰n h‰nest‰ oikein kovasti, toisinaan en voi siet‰‰ h‰nen
k‰tt‰‰n l‰hell‰ni. Enk‰ min‰ voi valehdella. Jos itse valehtelisin, ei
ruumiini kuitenkaan koskan valehtele.</b>" (from </font><i><font size="2">Ruumiin viisaus</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Iris Uurto was born Lyyli Ester Mielonen in Kerim‰ki, the daughter
of Paavo Mielonen, a farmer, and Maria Pennanen. Uurto did not like her
first names, Lyyli Ester, and wanted to be called Iris already in her
childhood. At the age of 15 she moved to Helsinki, where she graduated
in 1929 from a secondary school. During this period Uurto worked in odd
jobs, as a domestic servant, papergirl, and private teacher. At school
she contributed to the school magazine. In 1930 Uurto married Aukusti
Ripatti (see below), an aspiring writer and activist in leftist
organizations. Aku Rautala<b> </b>(pseudonym of Aukusti Ripatti) was a
metal worker and agitator, who was imprisoned for his political
activities after the Finnish Civil war in 1918. Later in the 1920s
Rautala portrayed Finnish working class people, among others in <i>Hehkuvan raudan miehi‰</i> (1930) and <i>K‰dettˆmien taistelu</i> (1930). Rautala retired from political activities in the late 1920s. </p>
<p>In 1930 Uurto published <em>Ruumiin ik‰v‰</em> (The Longing of the Body), a novel, and <em>Tulta ja tuhkaa</em> (Fire and Ashes), a collection of short stories. The&nbsp; appearance of&nbsp;these books also marked a turning 
point in her life. Abandoning her her studies at the University of Helsinki, Uurto devoted 
herself entirely to writing. Uurto's early success did not make her more sociable than she 
was. When the writer Helvi H‰m‰l‰inen met Uurto after the publication of 
<i>Tulta ja tuhkaa</i>, she gave H‰m‰l‰inen a copy of the book, 
saying that she has still plenty of writer's copies, but not so many acquaintances 
whom she could give it. </p>
<p><i>Ruumiin ik‰v‰, </i>later called the first Finnish psychoanalytical novel, was the sensation of the year and arose much controversy. In <i>Arvosteleva luettelo</i>
(critical book catalog), published by the State Library Office, Lauri
Pohjanp‰‰ characterized the&nbsp;work as pathological and a sad sign of
the times. Pohjanp‰‰, a poet and theologian, also saw <i>Tulta ja tuhkaa</i>
unsuitable for public libraries. Still in the 1950s the critic and
professor of literature Lauri Viljanen considered the title of the
novel sensationalist, but compared Uurto's intense imagination to that
of Sigrid Undset. Uurto's novel was translated into Swedish by Thomas
Warburton, who saw similarities in Uurto's and D.H. Lawrence's thought.
</p>
<p>In 1931 Aukusti Ripatti died accidentally. Uurto, a widow, was left alone to take care of her son, Aku-Kimmo <font size="2">(see below).</font> She joined the radical <em>Hiilet</em> (Coals) organization, which was established by the journalist <a href="jarnop.htm">Jarno Pennanen</a>. Its other founding members included Katri Vala, Armas Heikel, E.F. Rautela and Keijo Eronen. In the newspaper <i>Ajan Sana</i>, a mouthpiece of the right-wing peasant movement Lapuan liike, the organization was labelled as communist. <em>Hiilet</em> was suppressed by a court order. Although Uurto was not active in politics, she wrote for the Marxist literature magazine <i>Kirjallisuuslehti</i> and opposed actively in 1934-35 death penalty. In 1936 Uurto became a member of the literary group <em>Kiila</em>, which was founded by such young leftist writers as <a href="arvotur.htm">Arvo Turtiainen</a> and <a href="sinervo.htm">Elvi Sinervo</a>. The poet Katri Vala, a member of the radical literary group <em>Tulenkantajat</em> (The Flame Bearers), was&nbsp;Uurto's neighbor&nbsp;for a short time. </p>
<p>Uurto wrote her her next novel, <em>Kypsyminen</em> (The Ripening),
an examination of the crisis of bourgeois values, for five years.
It&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1935 and gained critical success&nbsp;&#8211; the
book was also translated into Swedish.&nbsp;Mrs. Pallas&nbsp;has no
identity outside her relationships with her family.&nbsp;Her carefully
built world is destroyed when&nbsp;the marriage ends. Lauri, Mrs.
Pallas's stepson Lauri falls in love with Maria, an extremely sensitive
woman. Maria cannot reject Mr. Attila, her "benefactor" and later
husband. The submissive Maria becomes a victim of her own Christian
self-sacrificing character. <em>Rakkaus ja pelko</em>&nbsp;(1936)
depicted the lower middle-class people. The central characters, Niilo
and Kaarina, Mrs. Pallas's stepdaughter, do not find balance in their
relationship and on Niilo's demand, Kaarina decides to abort her
pregnancy. <em>Timanttilakien alla</em>&nbsp;(1938) reflected Uurto's
changed political views and separation from her earlier radical
activities. The protagonist is Peter, Nord, who has joined a group of
young writers. He falls in love with Asta, the daughter of an executed
Red Guard officer. Asta's husband is imprisoned. She leaves Nord and
commits suicide with her new lover. Nord travels abroad to end his
life. Katri Vala praised the work in the leftist magazine <i>Tulenkantajat</i>, saying that the thin book contained more thoughts than many overwhelmingly heavier ones in appearance. </p>
<p>In the late 1930s Uurto wrote dramas without much theatrical success. <em>Satu sankarista</em>&nbsp;was
not produced at the National Theatre until 1945. This pacifist play was
set in the ancient Italy, and depicted the conquest of Veii, an
Etruscan city, which was taken after long siege by the dictator
Camillus. <em>Ruumiin viisaus (</em>Wisdom of the Body), a marriage
novel, was set in the literary world. One of the central characters is
an aspiring writer, Elias Aro. He marries Lea, an office employee, but
nearly loses her before he realizes that one can deceive the mind but
not the body. "The body is very wise..." Elias starts to look up to her
as superior to himself. Their happiness do not last long. Elias dies
accidentally and filled with new understanding of love, Lea continues
calmly her life with their child. <i>Ruumiin viisaus </i>was published in reworked form in Uurto's collected works in 1965 under the title <i>Villit henget</i> (Wild Spirits). Uurto rewrote also her other books. </p>
<p>In her doctoral thesis <i>El‰m‰n pit‰isi olla toisenlaista</i>
(2000, Life Shouldn't Be Like This) Tuula Spinkkil‰ sees that Uurto
challenged the patriarchal society and its literary institutions with
her strong emphasis on the human body. According to Spinkkil‰, Uurto's
work tells about the sexual difference and endless differences among
women, about the importance of human and more especially of female
corporeality and the potential wisdom of the female body. But the
battle of sexes is never solved and patriarchal culture is equally
suffocating for men as it is for women.&nbsp;One of her female
characters in <em>Ruumiin viisaus</em>, the mathematical genius Siiri Halava, commits suicide. </p>
<p>From the late 1930s Uurto did not participate in Kiila's activities.
The writer Jarno Pennanen criticized her for passivity. During the
Continuation War (1941-44) Uurto was one of the few writers who was not
in any way helping officially or unofficially the war efforts. These
years, filled with poverty pressure from authorities, she described in
her collections of poems<em> Sudet</em> (1944) and <em>Ihana lyhty</em>&nbsp;(1946).
After the war Uurto stated, that she is not going to participate in any
political activities or join any literary group&nbsp;&#8211; she is only a
member of humankind. Final break with Kiila came with the novel <em>Joonas ei v‰litt‰nyt</em>&nbsp;(1950), an ironic story of the adventures of Joonas Tela as the director of the bourgeois Suomi Theatre. </p>
<p>Uurto never remarried, but she had a serious love affair which ended
about 1950. In her later years Uurto, a shy and sensitive person,
increasingly chose seclusion. She hold the view that her books are her
biography and refused to give interviews. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">N‰‰n koko maailman, en rajoja,</font><br>
<font size="2">
rakastan koko maailmaa, en puolta,</font><br>
<font size="2">
en nurkkausta vain, en is‰nmaata. </font></b>
<br>
<font size="2">(I see the whole world, not the borders, <br>
I love the whole world, not a half of it, <br>
not a corner only, my native country.) </font><br>
<font size="2">(from<i> Ihana lyhty</i>, 1946)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1930s Uurto traveled in Estonia, Sweden, France and Italy,
and in the late 1940s she visited England, France, and Switzerland. <em>Kukkiva jakarandapuu</em> (<span class="st">The Flowering Jacaranda Tree)</span>,
a collection of poems, was rejected by her publisher. In the late 1950s
she lived some time at the Divine Life Society's ashram in Rishikesh,
India. After a nervous breakdown, she went to Switzerland for
treatment. Uurto died on April 1, 1994 in an old-age home. Aku-Kimmo
Ripatti died before her, in February in the same year. Uurto received
the State literary award four times (1936, 1942, 1944, 1969). </p>
<p>Uurto's last book, a war novel, <em>Den brinnande&nbsp;ˆn</em>
(1957, Puut juuriltaan), appeared first in Swedish, translated by the
writer Bo Carpelan. The Finnish, reworked edition, was published by
Otava in 1968. Uurto examined the psychological effects of war on the
soldiers and the experiences of women during the war years. At the end
of the story Allan, after spending years at the front, admits that he
cannot live the same inner life than before the war. Again Uurto refers
to the inner voice of her characters, the voice of nature. <i>Parnasso</i>,
the most important literary magazine in Finland, did not review the
book. Toini Havu wrote in her surprisingly negative introduction to
Uurto's collected works in 1970 that <i>Puut juuriltaan</i> is one of Uurto's best novels but an uncharacteristic work for her. </p>
<p>Uurto remained distant to her son, Aku-Kimmo Ripatti (1931-1994),
who also became a writer. Mostly she focused on her writing and her son
lived in Kerim‰ki in Uurto's childhood home. Later Ripatti worked as a
teacher and published novels, poems, and pamphlets of the life in
Finland's developing areas in Kainuu. Ripatti's documentary novel <i>Iris</i>
(1988) was about Uurto's childhood in Kerim‰ki. "Iris is my mother,"
Ripatti wrote. "However, I don't know her." As an anecdote Ripatti
tells, that Uurto wanted to buy in the early 1980s the Punkaharju
Ridge, a beautiful natural monument in eastern Finland, when she began
to believe that its trees will be cut down. Ripatti's other works
include <i>Luodemailta</i> (1962),<i> Kolmen vuoden lumet</i> (1964), <i>Siirtomaasuomi</i> (1970), <i>Sikojen juhla</i> (1970), <i>Kyˆsti Sorsan opintie</i> (1972), <i>Syrj‰maa</i> (1974), <i>Tervahanhi </i>(1974), <i>En sano muuta</i> (1986), <i>Arki soi</i> (1987). </p>
