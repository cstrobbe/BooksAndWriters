<p>English novelist and short story writer, whose unconventional
private life and determination to tackle social issues disconcerted his
contemporary audience. Many of Wilkie Collins' stories contain
sympathetic portraits of physically abnormal individuals. Critics often
credit Collins with the invention of the English detective novel. While
he was aware of the work of Poe and <a href="gaboria.htm">Gaboriau</a>, he restricted in the mainstream of Victorian domestic and social fiction. Sergeant Cuff from Collins' novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Moonstone</span>
(1868) became a prototype of the detective hero in English fiction.
Dorothy L. Sayers has called it "probably the very finest detective
story ever written." </p>
<blockquote><font color="White">--<b></b></font><b><font size="2">"Good night, Mr. Betteredge," he said. "And mind, if you ever take to growing roses, the white moss rose is all the better for <i>not</i> being budded on the dog rose, whatever the gardener may say to the contrary!" </font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">"What are you doing here?" I asked. "Why are you not in your proper bed?" </font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">"I am not in my
proper bed," answered the Sergeant, "because I am one of the many
people in this miserable world who can't earn their money honestly and
easily at the same time." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Moonstone</font></i><font size="2">) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilkie Collins was born in London into an artistic family. His
father was William Collins, a well-known landscape painter and a full
member of the Royal Academy. Harriet (Geddes) Collins, his mother, was
the daughter of a painter. Wilkie was named after the friend of his
father, the famous genre painter Sir David Wilkie. His parents were a
devoted couple, and young Wilkie grew with his brother in a secure
household. However, Collins never outgrew his childhood sickliness, he
was small and had a slightly deformed skull. One of his father's
friends was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. </p>

<p>Collins was educated privately, he studied painting for several years. 
At the age of eleven he began attending school, but at the end of the year the family moved to Italy, 
where  William Collins studied the old masters and experienced his first love adventure. </p>
<p>After nearly two years abroad, the family returned to England. With
the help of his father, Collins found work in the office of a tea
importer (1841-46). During this period he began to write fiction.
Collins' first story, 'The Last Stagecoachman', which owed a lot to
Charles Dickens, was published in 1843 in <i>The Illuminated Magazine</i>.
"I do not follow my father's profession," he wrote to the American
novelist R.H. Dana, and added, "I live very much in the society of
artists." </p>
<p>Without much enthusiasm, Collins studied  law  at Lincoln's Inn, but worked industriously on his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Antonina; or, The Fall of Rome</span> (1850), a historical story in the manner of Bulwer Lytton. His major source was Gibbon's <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>.
Only modestly successful, Collins abandoned the historical mode and
decided appeal "to the readiest sympathies and the largest number of
readers, by writing a story of our own times". At the age of 27 Collins
became a lawyer. He never practiced law but put his legal knowledge to
work in crime fiction. His father died in 1847 and Collins set aside
other literary aspirations to publish his father's biography, which
appeared in 1848. <span style="font-style: italic;">Basil</span>
(1852), published in three volumes by Richard Bentley, London, was
Collins' first novel based on crime, mystery, and suspense. Though it
was criticized as having "revolting details", Collins proved that he
could become a popular novelist. Basil was reprinted in 1856. A revised
edition, which involved over a thousand deletions, came out in 1862. </p>
<p>Collins started in 1851 his long friendship with <a href="dickens.htm">Dickens</a>,
while they were pursuing a mutual interest in amateur theatricals.
Inspired by the success of Dickens's Christmas books, Collins produced<span style="font-style: italic;"> Mr Wray's Cash Box</span> in 1852. A few years later he joined  the staff of Dickens's <i>Household Worlds</i>,
and collaborated with him on pieces for the magazine. Dickens helped
Collins bring humour and believable characters into his books and with
the elder author he worked closely on his early play, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lighthouse</span>
(1855), loosely based on the short story 'Gabriel's Marriage'. Collins'
brother Charles Allston married Dickens' daughter; he was a close
associate of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. </p>
<p>In 1858 Collins met Caroline Graves, a widow, who was his life
companion until his death; she died in 1895. Collins saw her first at a
mysterious midnight encounter of which he made use in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Woman in White</span>
(1860). Caroline's daughter became his amanuensis. He also had
relationship with Mrs Martha Rudd ("Mrs Dawson"), the daughter of a
shepherd, whose three children Collins acknowledged as his own. By 1868
she lived in London as Collins' mistress, Caroline Graves lived with
him as a "housekeeper." In 1868 Caroline married Joseph Clow, but
returned to Collins within two years. </p>
<p>The enormously popular suspense thriller <i>Woman in White</i> appeared first in Dickens's periodical <i>All the Year Round</i>
in 1859-60. Using a multivocal narrative, Collins imitated the
presentation of testimony from a number of witnesses in a court case.
The story revolves around the evil Sir Percival Glyde's plot to steal
his wife's inheritance with the help of a sinister Italian, Count
Fosco. Walter Hartright goes to Limmeridge House in Cumberland as
drawing master to Laura Fairlie and her half-sister Marian Halcombe. He
sees Anne Catherick on the night she left an asylum to which she had
been committed by Sir Percival. Anne knows a secret about his past &#8211;
his illegitimacy. Sir Percival burns the parish registry and is killed
in the resulting fire. Laura has been committed to an asylum as Anne,
but Walter restores Laura to her true identity. Like in <i>Basil</i> (or in Walter Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i> and James Fenimore Cooper's <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>) Collins had two opposite woman characters, one dark and one light.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">No Name</span> (1862) tells of a
young woman learns that she and her sister are illegitimate and
penniless after the death of their father, but she starts her
countermove to regain her inheritance. <span style="font-style: italic;">Armadale</span> (1866) was a story of fate, criminal fraud, and an attempted murder. Its anti-heroine Lydia Gwilt has been called "the first <i>femme fatale</i> in the modern sense." </p>
<p>In <i>Moonstone</i>, the first English detective novel, Collins
created Sergeant Cuff, whose numerous traits would turn up in detective
fiction for generations to come. '"I haven't much time to be fond of
anything," says Sergeant Cuff." "But when I <i>have</i> a moment's fondness to bestow, most times... the roses get it."' <font size="2">(<i>The Moonstone</i>, 1868) </font><i>Moonstone </i>unfolds
through the words of its various characters. Cuff interviews people at
a country house to discover who stole a huge diamond that has a violent
history. The plot includes also somnambulism and experiments with
opium, Oriental magic, and three mysterious Hindus. By making the
criminal a member of the same class as the victim, Collins challenged
the idea, that criminal behavior of the lower classes threatened the
peace of the middle class. The crime is committed by one of the
investigators unknowingly under the influence of opium. </p>


 
<p>In the short story 'The Terribly Strange Bed', which opens in Paris,
the narrator is nearly killed because of his own activities. Shortly
after finishing his college education, he seeks excitement in one of
the gambling houses but finds it too fashionable and enters an obscure
gambling-room. He has incredible luck, he wins all the time, and drinks
much champagne. Then he meets an old soldier, who advises him to sleep
comfortably in the house, it is too late to go home. In his room
upstairs he rests in a four-post bed, and remembers a picnic party in a
Welsh valley, and a young lady who quoted 'Childe Harold'. "Of all the
wonderful faculties that help to tell us we are immortal, which speaks
the sublime truth more eloquently than memory?" In the middle of his
recollections he sees that that the bed top is silently coming down.
The canopy is a thick mattress and the whole bed a machine for secret
murder by suffocation. He escapes, goes to the police, and in the end
the villains are arrested. Collins fills the story with forebodings &#8211;
the reader knows that the narrator's luck is not natural, that he
should not trust the old soldier, and there is something wrong with the
room. </p>
<blockquote> <font size="2"><b>"What brought good Wilkie's genius nigh perdition? / Some demon whispered </b></font><b><font size="2"> &#8211; </font><font size="2"> ' Wilkie! Have a mission.' "</font></b><font size="2"></font><font size="2"><b> </b></font><font size="2">(<b></b>Charles Swinburne, 1889) </font></blockquote>
<p>Collins, who suffered severely from the rheumatic pains, became
addicted to laudanum, a form of opium; it was used perhaps even more
heavily by <a href="quincey.htm">Thomas De Quincey</a> or Samuel
Taylor Coleridge. In 1873 Collins made a tour in the United States,
where he met Mark Twain and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The death of
Dickens in 1870 robbed Collins of a powerful mentor, and he became more
interested in the theatre, which had been one of his passions from
early on. Between 1871-73 three Collins plays were produced in the West
End of London. <i>The Woman in White </i>was a commercial success at
the Olympic Theatre, but Collins himself was not satisfied with his
stage version, in which a 700-page novel was reduced into an 88-page
play. Burdened by poor health, Collins continued to write in his final
years. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Magdalen</span> (1873) Collins attacked the attitudes to fallen women,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Evil Genius</span>
(1886) dealt with adultery and divorce. Collins died from a stroke on
23 September 1889. Never yielding to Victorian conventions, Collins had
insisted upon a simple funeral in his will. His final novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Blind Will </span>(1890), which came out posthumously, was was finished by Walter Besant. </p>
