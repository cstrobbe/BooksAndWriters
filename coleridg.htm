<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>

<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English lyrical poet, critic, and philosopher, 
whose <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, written with <a href="wordswor.htm">William Wordsworth</a>,
started the English Romantic movement. Although Coleridge's poetic
achievement was small in quantity, his metaphysical anxiety,
anticipating modern existentialism, has gained him reputation as an
authentic visionary. Shelley called him "hooded eagle among blinking
owls." </p>

 
<blockquote>
<p><b><font size="2">"The influence of Coleridge, like that of Bentham,
extends far beyond those who share in the peculiarities of his
religious or philosophical creed. He has been the great awakener in
this country of the spirit of philosophy, within the bounds of
traditional opinions. He has been, almost as truly as Bentham, 'the
great questioner of things established'; for a questioner needs nor
necessarily be an enemy." </font></b><font size="2">(John Stuart Mill,&nbsp;in</font><i><font size="2"> Coleridge</font></i><font size="2">, 1840) </font></p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge was born in Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire, the
son of the Reverend John Coleridge, and Ann Bowdon, the daughter of a
farmer. At the time of his birth, Coleridge's father was already
fifty-three years old, Ann, his second wife, was forty-five. Coleridge,
the youngest of ten children, was adored by his parents. Later
Coleridge described his childhood as full fantasy: "At six years old I
remember to have read <i>Belisarius</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and <i>Philip Quarll </i>&#8211; and then I found the <i>Arabian 
Nights'</i>
entertainments &#8211; one tale of which (the tale of a man who was compelled
to seek for a pure virgin) made so deep an impression on me (I had read
it in the evening while my mother was mending stockings) that I was
haunted by spectres whenever I was in the dark &#8211; and I distinctly
remember the anxious and fearful e
agerness with which I used to watch the window in which the books
lay&nbsp;&#8211; and whenever the sun lay upon them, I would seize it, carry
it by the wall, and bask, and read." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>After his father's death, Coleridge was sent away to Christ's
Hospital School in London. Coleridge studied at Jesus College. He
joined in the reformist movement stimulated by the French Revolution,
and abandoned his studies in 1793. In desperation, after an unhappy
love-affair and pressed by debt, he enlisted in the 15th Light Dragoons
under the name of Silas Tomkin Comberbache. Soon he realized that he
was unfit for an army career and he was brought out under 'insanity'
clause by his brother, Captain James Coleridge. In Cambridge Coleridge
met the radical, future poet laureate Robert Southey (1774-1843) in
1794. Coleridge moved with him to Bristol to establish a community, but
the plan failed. In 1795 he married the sister of Southey's fiancée
Sara Fricker, whom he did not really love. </p>
<p>Coleridge's <em>Poems on Various Subjects</em> (1796) was followed by&nbsp;<em> Poems</em> (1797). With the publication of these works,&nbsp;he launched&nbsp;a short-lived liberal political periodical <i>The Watchman</i>.&nbsp;Coleridge
formed a close friendship with Dorothy and William Wordsworth, one of
the most fruitful creative relationships in English literature. From it
resulted <i>Lyrical Ballads,</i> which opened with Coleridge's 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' and ended with Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey'<i>. </i>The poems set a new style by using everyday language and fresh ways of looking at nature. </p>
<p>'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', a 625-line ballad, is among his
essential works. It tells of a sailor who kills an albatross and for
that crime against nature endures terrible punishments. The ship upon
which the Mariner serves is trapped in a frozen sea. An albatross comes
to the aid of the ship, it saves everyone, and stays with the ship
until the Mariner shoots it with his crossbow. The motiveless malignity
leads to punishment: "And now there came both mist and show, / And it
grew wondrous cold; / And ice, mast high, came floating by, / As green
as emerald." After a ghost ship passes the crew begin to die but the
mariner is eventually rescued. He knows his penance will continue and
he is only a machine for dictating always the one story. </p><p>When
Mrs. Barbauld objected to Coleridge that the poem lacked a moral, the
poet told her that "in my own judgment the poem had too much; and that
the only or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the
moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of
action in a work of pure imagination." Partly the poem was inspired by
Captain James Cook's second voyage (1772-1775), during which he
circumnavigated the entire of Antarctica. Coleridge himself was also a
traveler, who lived in Malta and Italy, and visited many of the
capitals of Europe. In many poems he utilized travel as a narrative
elements, it was a source of inspiration, and an argument against
intellectual stagnation: "Keep moving! Steam, or Gas, or Stage, / Hold,
cabin, steerage, hencoop's cage &#8211; / Tour, Journey, Voyage, Lounge,
Ride, Walk, / Skim, Sketch, Excursion, Travel-talk &#8211; / For move you
must!" </p>
<p>The brothers Josiah and Thomas Wedgewood granted Coleridge an
annuity of 150 pounds, thus enabling him to pursue his literary career.
Disenchanted with political developments in France, Coleridge visited
Germany in 1798-99 with Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and became
interested in the works of <a href="ikant.htm">Immanuel Kant</a>. He studied philosophy at Göttingen University and mastered the German language. However, he considered his translations of <a href="schiller.htm">Friedrich von Schiller</a>'s plays from the trilogy <i>Wallenstein </i>distasteful.
At the end of 1799 Coleridge fell in love with Sara Hutchinson, the
sister of Wordsworth's future wife, to whom he devoted his work <em>Dejection: An Ode</em> (1802). During these years Coleridge also began to compile his <em>Notebooks</em>, daily meditations of his life. </p><p>According
to Coleridge, he heard the words to his famous 'Kubla Khan' in a
dream.&nbsp;He had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and
Linton in the summer of 1797.&nbsp;After taking&nbsp;anodyne, reading <span style="font-style: italic;">Purchas's Pilgrimage</span>,
and&nbsp;sleeping three&nbsp;hours, he woke up with a clear image of
the poem. "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree: /
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran / Through caverns measureless to man
/ Down to a sunless sea. / So twice five miles of fertile ground / With
walls and towers were girdled round: / And there were gardens bright
with sinuous rills, / Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; /
And here were forests ancient as the hills / Enfolding sunny spots of
greenery."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Kubla Khan</font></i><font size="2">, 1798)</font>
Disturbed by a "person on business from Porlock," he lost the vision,
with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images.
Attempts to reveal the identity of the visitor have been fruitless.
Modern scholarship is skeptical of this story, but it reveals
Coleridge's interest in the workings of the subconscious. While
acknowledging the brilliance of his work, Norman Furman argued in <em>Coleridge, the Damaged Archangel</em>
(1971) that the poet fabricated untruths about&nbsp;circumstances under
which he created his poems, and&nbsp;plagiarized ideas&nbsp;from
others. &nbsp;</p><p>'Christabel'<i> </i>and<i> </i>'Kubla Khan<i>' </i>circulated many years in oral form before publication, and especially 'Christabel' influenced later the works of <a href="wscott.htm">Sir Walter Scott</a> and <a href="byron.htm">Lord Byron</a>.
Humphry Davy, a chemist and inventor, persuaded his literary friends,
including Coleridge and Robert Southey, to self-experiment with nitrous
oxide (laughing gas), and published their accounts in <em>Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, Chiefly Concerning Nitrous Oxide</em> (1800). In addition, Davy edited the&nbsp;second edition of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>.
Davy made made a huge impression on Coleridge, who
incorporated&nbsp;topical scientific&nbsp; allusions in his poems,
expressed an interest in assisting Davy in the laboratory,&nbsp;and
reportedly said that "Had not Daly been the first chemist, he,
probably, would have been the first poet of his age." </p>
<p>Coleridge never became addicted to laughing gas, but suffering from
neuralgic and rheumatic pains, he developed a dependency on opium,
freely prescribed by physicians. In 1804 he sailed to Malta in search
of better health. Supplied with an ounce of opium and nine ounces of
laudanum, he wrote in his journal: "O dear God! give me strength of
soul to make one thorough Trial &#8211; If I land at Malta / spite of all
horrors to go through one month of unstimulated nature..."<b></b><font size="2"></font>
He worked two years as secretary to the governor of Malta, and later
traveled through Sicily and Italy, returning then to England. In
1809-10 he wrote and edited with Sara Hutchinson the literary and
political magazine <i>The Friend</i>. From 1808 to 1818 he he gave several lectures, chiefly in London, and was considered the greatest of <a href="shakespe.htm">Shakespearean</a> critics. </p>
<p>Coleridge's friendship with Wordsworth came to crisis in 1810, and
the two poets never fully returned to the relationship they had
earlier. During the following years, Coleridge lived in London, on the
verge of suicide. <em>Remorse</em>, a play which he had written many
years earlier, was succesfully produced at the Drury Lane theatre in
1813. He received £400, which he spent in a few months. After a
physical and spiritual crisis at Greyhound Inn, Bath, he submitted
himself to a series of medical régimes to free himself from opium. He
found a permanent harbor in Highgate in the household of Dr. James
Gillman, and enjoyed almost legendary reputation among the younger
Romantics. During this time he rarely left the house. </p>
<p>The unfinished poems 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' were published in 1816, <em>Sybilline Leaves</em> came out the next year.<em>&nbsp;</em>From the late 1810s
&nbsp;Coleridge devoted himself to theological and politico-sociological works &#8211; 
his final position was that of a Romantic conservative and Christian radical. "Every reform, however 
necessary, will by weak minds be carried to an excess, that itself will need reforming," he&nbsp;said in&nbsp;<em>Biographia Literaria</em> (1817). Coleridge contributed to several magazines, among them <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>.
In 1824 Coleridge was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of
Literature. He died in Highgate, near Londonon July 25, 1834.
Coleridge's daughter Sara (1802-1852)&nbsp;became a writer and
translator, too. She published children's verse,<em>&nbsp;<span class="st">Pretty Lessons In Verse For Good Children</span></em> (1834) and&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Phantasmion</em></span> (1837). When her husband died she took up the task of editing her father's work.</p>
