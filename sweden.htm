<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Swedish philosopher, theologian, chemist,
anatomist, and mystic, fluent in eleven languages. Swedenborg devoted
the first half of his life to scientific investigations. Thereafter he
turned his full attention to theology, metaphysics and started to
explore mystical experience. Among Swedenborg's most popular books are <i>Heaven
and Hell</i> and <i>Earths in Universe</i>. His spiritual writing
influenced Emerson, Goethe, Henry James Sr., Dostoevsky, and William
Blake. During his career, Swedenborg published over 50 works. His books
have been translated into some thirty languages. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There are two worlds, a spiritual
world where angels and spirits are, and a natural world where men are."
</b>(in <i>The True Christian Religion</i>, Swedenborg
Society, 1890) </font></blockquote>
<p>Emanuel Swedenborg was born in Stockholm, the second son of
Jesper Svedberg (1653-1735), a Lutheran bishop and hymn writer, and
Sara Behm. Both families had acquired wealth in the mining business.
Swedenborg's mother died in 1696 and his father married again. He was
feared by the royal court because of his sermons against abuse of
power, and loved by people who believed he had powers as an exorciser.
From the age of eleven to twenty-one Swedenborg studied mechanics,
geography, astronomy, and mathematics at the University of Uppsala. </p>
<p>Upon graduation he travelled to Holland, Germany and England.
Because the English authorities believed that plague had broken in
Sweden, his ship was obliged to wait offshore for six weeks. Swedenborg
went ashore anyway, was caught and very nearly hanged. He lived in
England from 1710 to 1713, and formed a lasting love for its culture.
"But as the English are not very talkative, he fell into the habit of
conversing with devils and Angels," said the Argentine writer Jorge
Luis Borges <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The Book of
Imaginary Beings</font></i><font size="2">, 1969)</font>. In 1716 King
Charles XII of Sweden named him special assessor to the Royal College
of Mines. He worked in several scientific fields from mathematics and
physics to geology, and twice attempted to marry.</p>
<p>Swedenborg's career also included extensive service in the
upper house of the Swedish national legislature. In 1716-1718 he edited
the scientific magazine <i>Daedalus </i>Hyperboreus, which published
texts in Swedish. Most of his own books Swedenborg published in Latin. <i>Opera
Philosophica et Mineralia</i> (1734) was about metals; in <i>Regnum
Animale</i> (1744-45) Swedenborg examined the mysteries of soul; <i>De
Cultu et Amore Dei </i>(1745, Worship and the Love of God) dealt with
the birth of the world; and <i>Arcana Coelestia</i> (1749-1756) was a
commentary on Genesis. </p>
<p>As an inventor Swedenborg produced a dry dock of new design, a
machine for working salt springs, and a system for moving large boats
overland. In biology he supplied the first accurate understanding of
the importance of the cerebral cortex. But the conflict between
Swedenborg's scientific and mediumistic sides deepened and he started
to record his dreams, anticipating Jungian psychoanalysis in his
self-analysis. </p>
<p>A turning point in his life was, when he began to have
visionary experiences in 1743-45 Swedenborg then devoted himself to
prophesy and spiritual investigations. On the morning of October 1743
he noted in Amsterdam that "such dizziness or <i>deliquium </i>(a
swooning away) overcame me that I felt close to death." In a dream a
roaring wind picked him up and threw him on his face. A hand clutched
his own clasped hand and he saw Christ. Vicious dogs turned up
frequently, and his dead father appeared to him, praising his son's
theological work. In 1744 on Easter Monday Christ asked the astonished
visionary, whether he had a health certificate. Swedenborg described in
<i>De Telluribus</i> his trip around the Solar System, which is
seen as having a spiritual significance. The book also contains some
scientific speculation about the planets. Swedenborg became convinced
that he had been designated by God as a spiritual emissary to explore
higher planes and to report his findings to humankind. He entered
ecstatic trances, visiting heaven and hell. However, contemporaries
found him sane and sensible. </p>
<p>In modern analysis Swedenborg's trances have been explained by
his repressed or transcended sexuality. Dr Wilson Van Dusen has claimed
that Swedenborg's descriptions of angelic and hellish spirits match the
hallucinatory experiences of schizophrenics. He spent sixteen years
treating the hallucinations of his patients as realities, and published
his findings in <i>The Presence of Other Worlds</i> (1974). According
to Van Dusen, "All Swedenborg's observations on the effect of evil
spirits entering man's consciousness conform to my finding." Of the
inhabitants of Venus Swedenborg said: "They are of two kinds; some are
gentle and benevolent, others wild, cruel and of gigantic stature." Of
the Moon he revealed that the inhabitants are "small, like children of
six or seven years old; at the same time they have the strength of men
like ourselves."&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1747 Swedenborg was nominated for president of the Royal
College of Mines. Communication with spirits led to his resignation
from his government job. Later on he wrote to the landgrave of
Hessen-Darmstadt: "Because the Lord had prepared me for this from
childhood, he revealed himself in person to me, his servant, and
ordered me to perform this work. This happened in the year 1743, and
afterward he showed me the face of my spirit and thus led me into the
world of the spirits and allowed me to see heaven and its wonders, and
at the same time to see hell as well, and also to speak with angels and
spirits, and this has gone on continually for twenty-seven years." On a
half-pension he became ascetic and added theological writings to his
already lengthy list of scientific and philosophical works. His talents
also included clairvoyance. On the evening of July 19, 1759, he was
visiting Göteborg. At a party, he suddenly 'knew' that a fire raged in
Stockholm, almost three hundred miles away, and threatened his own
house. Next day his account of the disaster was fully confirmed. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When, for instance, the vision
arose in Swedenborg's mind of a fire in Stockholm, there was a real
fire raging there at the same time, without there being any
demonstrable or even thinkable connection between the two. I certainly
would not like to undertake to prove the archetypal connection in this
case. I would only point to the fact that in Swedenborg's biography
there are certain things which throw a remarkable light on his psychic
state. We must assume that there was a lowering of the threshold of
consciousness which gave him access to "absolute knowledge." The fire
in Stockholm was, in a sense, burning in him too."</b> (</font><a href="cjung.htm"><font size="2">Carl Jung</font></a><font size="2"> in
</font><i><font size="2">Synchronicity</font></i><font size="2">,
1960) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1762 Swedenborg went into a trance and described the
assassination of the Russian Tsar Peter III. His publications from this
visionary period include<i> Worship and the Love of God</i>, <i>Arcana
Caelestia</i>, an exposition of the spirit teachings he received, and <i>Heaven
and Hell</i> (1758), description of the afterlife. In <i>Earths in the
Universe</i> Swedenborg claimed that the moon is peopled by a race
which speaks through its stomachs &#8211; the sound is like belching.
Contemporaries took Swedenborg's psychic powers seriously: he impressed
Queen Louisa Ulrica, sister of Frederick the Great, by delivering a
private message from her dead brother, Augustus William. He believed he
had the ability to slow down his breathing. "I became so completely
accustomed to this type of respiration," he once said, "that I
sometimes passed an entire hour without taking a breath. I had breathed
in only enough air so that I could think." Occasionally he conversed
with such prominent figures as Abraham, Solomon, and the apostles. </p>
<p>His later years Swedenborg spent mostly in England, remaining
a bachelor. His writings, which influenced <a href="wblake.htm">William
Blake</a> (1757-1827), paved the way for the Romantic movement.
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) criticized Swedenborg in <i>Dreams of a
Spirit-Seer, Illustrated by Dreams of Metaphysics</i> (1766), and
wanted to place him in a madhouse. His last work, <i>Vera Christiana
Religio</i> (1771) was a summary of his religious views. Swedenborg
died in a lodging house on March 29, 1772 &#8211; precisely at the time he
had predicted &#8211; in London, and was bried in the Swedish Church in
Prince's Square. Swedenborg's skull was later stolen. In 1908 his
remains were moved to Uppsala. His followers founded the New Jerusalem
Church in England in 1778 and in the United States in 1792. James Glen
formed in 1784 a Swedenborgian reading circle in Philadelphia. The
Swedenborg Society was established in 1810. During the 19th century
Swedenborgians enjoyed a considerable vogue, but in the 20th century
the interest has decreased. </p>
<p>Swedenborg believed that God created humankind to exist
simultaneously in the physical world and in the spiritual world, which
belongs to the inner domain. It has its own memory, which is what
survives after death. Swedenborg's hell has no Satan; heaven is
populated by the spirits of the dead that carry on lives and habits
much the same as they did on earth. Jesus' crucifixion did not atone
for the sins of humankind; we make our own heaven and hell.</p>
<p>After one of his consultations with angels, Swedenborg
declared that the end of the world was to arrive 1757. He never doubted
his insights and afterwards, rejecting traditional doctrines of the
Trinity and Atonement, Swedenborg insisted that the Judgment had really
occurred in 1757, along with Christ's second coming as a triumph over
rebellious spirits. He believed that there is a correspondence between
natural and spiritual levels; each person lives in both realms at once.
Eternal life is an inner condition beginning with earthly life; gradual
redemption occurs through personal regulation of spiritual states.
Practical love is a necessity in every relationship. </p>
