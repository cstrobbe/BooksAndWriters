<p>Russian novelist, playwright, short story writer, and essayist, whose famous anti-utopia <i>My </i>(1924, We) prefigured <a href="ahuxley.htm">Aldous Huxley</a>'s <i>Brave New World (</i>1932), and inspired <a href="gorwell.htm">George Orwell'</a>s <i>1984 </i>(1949).
The book was considered a "malicious slander on socialism" in the
Soviet Union, and it was not until 1988 when Zamyatin was
rehabilitated. In the English-speaking world <i>My </i>has appeared in several translations. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"And then, just the way it was this
morning in the hangar, I saw again, as though right then for the first
time in my life, I saw everything: the unalterably straight streets,
the sparkling glass of the sidewalks, the divine parallelepipeds of the
transparent dwellings, the squared harmony of our gray-blue ranks. And
so I felt that I&nbsp;? </strong><strong>not generations of people,
but I myself&nbsp;? I had conquered the old God and the old life, I
myself had created all this, and I'm like a tower, I'm afraid to move
my elbow for fear of shattering the walls, the cupolas, the machines..."</strong> (in <i>We</i>, tr.&nbsp; Clarence Brown, 1993) </font></blockquote>
<p>Yevgeny Ivanovich Zamyatin was born in the provincial town of
Lebedian, some two hundred miles south of Moscow. His father was an
Orthodox priest and schoolmaster, and his mother musician. He attended
Progymnasium in Lebedian and gymnasium in Voronezh. From 1902 to 1908
he studied naval engineering at St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute.
While still a student, he joined the Bolshevik Party. In 1905 he made a
study trip in the Near East. Due to his revolutionary activities
Zamyatin was arrested in 1905 and exiled. His first short story, 'Odin'
(1908), drew on his experiences in prison. </p>
<p>Zamyatin lived illegally in St. Petersburg, spent some time in
Finland in 1906, and continued his studies. After graduating as a naval
engineer in 1908 he lectured at the Polytechnic Institute and began
publishing fiction and technical articles. Zamyatin was again
imprisoned and exiled in 1911, but two years later he was given
amnesty. In 1916 he was sent to England to supervise the construction
of icebreakers at the Armstrong-Whitworth shipyards in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. On the eve of the October Revolution, Zamyatin
returned to Russia. His stay in England inspired such satirical works
as <i>Ostrovitiane </i>(1918, 'The Islanders'), in which he satirized English obsession with timetables,&nbsp;and <i>Lovets cheloveka </i>(1921,
'The Fisher of Men'), which takes place in a London suburb. In the
Soviet Union Zamyatin was known as "the Englishman" because of his
moustache, neat tweed suits, and formal behavior. </p><p>Zamyatin'is first book, <i>Uezdnoe </i>(1913,
'A Provincial Tale'), a satire of Russian small-town life, brought him
widespread recognition among critics of the regime. <i>Na kulichkakh </i>(1914, A Godforsaken Hole) was published in the Socialist-Revulutionary Party's almanac, <i>Zavety</i>, which had also printed <i>Uezdnoe</i>.
The story depicted drinking, racism, and barbarism in an army garrison
in Vladivostok, and led to the confiscation of the journal. Zamyatin
himself was tried for maligning the military. During this period
Zamyatin was close to the so-called "Scythian" movement. "This is the
tragedy and the biter, racking happiness of the true Scythian: he can
never rest on laurels, he will never be with the practical victors,
with those who rejoice and sing 'Glory Be,'" Zamyatin wrote in one of
his essays. </p>
<p>In 1917-18 Zamyatin&nbsp;contributed articles under the pseudonym of M. Platonov 
for Socialist newspapers, and in the early 1920s he edited of the 
journals <i>Dom Iskusstva</i>, <i>Sovremennyi zapad</i>, and <i>Ruskii 
sovremennik</i>. He lectured on writing techniques in the "House 
of Arts," which had been established in Petrograd by Gorky, served 
on the board of numerous literary organisations, and worked for the World 
Literature Publishing house, where he edited Russian translations of 
Jack London, H.G. Wells, Romain Rolland, O. Henry, and Anatole France. 
</p>

<p>Although Zamyatian welcomed the revolution, he criticized its 
repression of freedom, and barbarity of the new regime. In Petrograd 
Zamyatin enjoyed the fame of a grand master of literature. His disciples established in 1921&nbsp;a group, called the Serapion 
Brothers after <a href="hoffman.htm">E.T.A. Hoffmann</a>'s&nbsp; collection of stories&nbsp;<em>Die Serapions-Brüder</em>
(1819-21). The Serapions insisted on their apolitical stance but they
all had problems with the censors. Among the members were Konstantin
Fedin, Veniamin Kaverin, Lev Lunts, Viktor Shklovsky, Vsevolod Ivanov,
Nikolay Nikitin, Mikhail Slonimsky, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Nikolay
Tikhonov, and Elizaveta Poloskaya. When Zamyatin surveyed in 1923 the
new Russian prose, he criticized both the Proletkult writers and theSerapion 
Brothers. He remarked the&nbsp; language of the epoch was rapid and pungent, like a code.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Zamyatin's <i>Peshchere</i> (1922, The Cave), 
about coldness and poverty in civil-war Petrograd, inspired 
Friedrich Ermler's film <i>House in the Snow Drifts</i> (1927). 
Ermler's most famous and notorious film is perhaps <i>The Great 
Citizen</i> (1939), about the life and murder of the Communist Party 
leader Sergei Kirov. The film received the Stalin Prize first class. </p>

<p>Zamyatin was arrested in 1919 and 1922.&nbsp;He published in the magazine <i>Dom Iskusstv</i> an article entitled 'I am Afraid' (1921), in which he accused the government of suppressing free thought. His play <i>Blokha </i>(1926),
based on Leskov's folk-story 'Levsha' and produced with sets by Boris
Kustodiyev, was a great success, but the production was closed by
cultural officials. <br>
</p>
      <p>Considered a heretic and "an open enemy of the working class,"
Zamyatin was constantly attacked in the late 1920s by Communist
Party-line critics, and he had to give up the leadership of the
All-Russian Writers' Union. Zamyatin argued that the post-revolutionary
age is best represented by work which form a synthesis of the fantastic
and common life. By this he meant his own fable <span style="font-style: italic;">We</span> and perhaps Bulgakov's <i>The Master and Margarita.</i>
His writings were banned, removed from libraries, and he was unable to
publish. Zamyatin's contribution as one of the libretists to Dmitry
Shostakovich's satirical opera <i>The Nose</i> (1927-8), based on Gogol's story, is unclear; other writers were Georgy Yonin, Alexander Preiss, and the composer himself. </p>

<p>After writing a letter to Stalin, Zamyatin was allowed to go with
his wife into exile in 1931. He settled in Paris in 1932, where he
lived in poverty. The film director Jean Renoir&nbsp;hired&nbsp;him
to&nbsp;co-write the script for&nbsp;<em> Les Bas-fonds</em>, based on
Gorky's play. The setting was changed from Russia to a French slum. For
the last years of his life Zamyatin worked on <i>Bich Bozhii</i>, a
novel on Attila and Rome, which paralleled the 20th century conflict
between Russia and West. He never finished the book. Zamyatin died in
Paris on March 10, 1937, dreaming of return to the Soviet Union. During
the following decades Zamyatin's works were studied and published in
the West, and he was characterized as one of the most brilliant Russian
writers of the 20th century. With the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev's
glasnost and perestroika policies banned Soviet masterpieces were again
published, among them Boris Pasternak's <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>, Bulgakov's <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, Grossman's <i>Life and Fate</i>, and Zamyatin's <i>My</i>. </p>
<p><i>My</i>, completed in 1921, was the only full-length novel
Zamyatin wrote. Extracts from the original text were published in an
émigre journal in Prague in 1927. In Russia <i>My </i>circulated in manuscripts. At an imaginative level, claims the author Martin Seymour-Smith in <i>The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written</i> (1998), <i>My</i> is "far above even <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>". Besides Orwell, <i>My</i> inspired Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i>,
although the latter writer did not acknowledge this fact. The first
English translation was published in 1924, in the 1970s appeared two
translations, and also in the 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed.
Orwell got in his hands a French translation, entitled <em>Nous Autres,</em> not the&nbsp;American edition from 1924. In his review in <em>Tribune&nbsp;</em><font size="2"> (4 January, 1946)</font>
Orwell wrote: "So far as I can judge it is not a book of the first
order, but it is certainly an unusual one, and it is astonishing that
no English publisher has been enterprising enought to reissue
it."&nbsp;Orwell urged Fredric Warburg to publish the work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
The story is set in the twenty-sixth century A.D. in a totalitarian,
standardized One State of the future. Its dictator is the all-powerful
"Benefactor," who offers the citizens, called Numbers, security and
material affluence but not freedom. All the citizens wear identical
grey-blue unifiorms with bandages bearing their numbers. There is no
freedom, because freedom and crime are closely connected: "If man's
freedom is nil, he commits no crimes." Special guardians spy upon the
behaviour and morals of the numbers. The narrator, D-503, is an
engineer and chief mathematician of the state, who fully accepts the
total control and rationality of the mechanized and centralized state.
He is&nbsp;terminating the construction of&nbsp;&nbsp;an interplanetary
vessel and begins to write notes for the inhabitansts of other planets.
However, his observations in his diary reveal a huge between the
reality and his orthodox view of it: "And the what a sky! Blue,
unsullied by a single cloud (what primitive tastes of the ancients must
have had if their poets were inspired by those absurd, untidy clumps of
mist, idiotically jostling one another about). I love&nbsp;&#8211; and I am
sure I am right in saying we love&nbsp;&#8211; only such a sky as this one:
sterile and immaculate. On days like this the whole world seems to have
been cast of the same immovable and everlasting glass as the Green
Wall, as all of our structures. On days like this you can see into the
deep blue depth of things, you see their hitherto unsuspected,
astonishing equations&nbsp;&#8211; you see this in the most ordinary, the
most everyday things." </p><p>D-503
falls in love with I-330, a member of a revolutionary group, but their
love is doomed. The caretaker of D's house makes a report&nbsp;to the
guardians. Like in <i>1984</i>, love is destroyed by the totalitarian
system. D-503 becomes again&nbsp;the faithful servant of the One State
when his imagination is removed in&nbsp;the Great&nbsp;Operation. I-330
and other revolutionaries are subjected to torture and sent to the
modern improved guillotine. Though Zamyatin's target in <em>We </em>was
not the NEP Period in early Soviet history, but a highly rationalized
industrial society, the book was also a prophecy of&nbsp;Stalinism. As
Gleb Struve said in 25 <em>Years of Soviet Russian Literature: 1918-1943</em>,
"It is obvious that in this institution of guardians the Communist
Government should see a satire of certain of its own methods."
Zamyatin's vision of a rule-dominated society owes much to his
experiences in war-time Britain. </p><p>Zamyatin's early stories satirized the backwardness of the
provincial Russia, later on his target was the Communist system. All
kinds of dogmatism&nbsp;&#8211; religious dogmas included and perhaps on a
personal level the Orthodox beliefs of his father&nbsp;&#8211; gave material
for several of his stories. In 'God' a cockroach, Senka, doesn't
believe in God, until he sees Mizumin the postman, who says. "A-ah,
cockroach that I love, my friend from behind the stove&nbsp;&#8211; where you
been keeping yourself? Greetings!" Mizumin's plans to marry fail, he
comes home drunk, and drops Senka into one of his canal-boats, size 14.
Senka begs his God: "Have mercy upon me!" Mizumin finds Senka and
places him on the wall, saying: "Creep on!" And Senka confesses: "How
unbearably great was God, how merciful, how mighty!" </p>
