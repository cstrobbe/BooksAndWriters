<p>French writer whose best-known novels are <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Pont de la rivière Kwaï</span> (1952, The Bridge over the River Kwai), a story of a foolish pride, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> La Planète des singes</span>
(1963, Planet of the Apes), both of which were adapted into highly
successful films. Several of Boulle's works deal more or less directly
with his experiences in Southeast Asia. However, <i>The Bridge Over the River Kwai</i>
and the movie based on it, are both fictitious and Boulle was never a
prisoner of the Japanese. Like Graham Greene, he used the frame of an
adventure, war or a spy story to study themes of false ideals and human
destructiveness. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As my gorilla walked past me again,
having finished his rounds, I tried by every means to attract his
attention. I tapped on the bars; I made sweeping gestures, pointing at
my mouth, with the result that he condescended to resume the
experiment. Then, on the first blast of the whistle, and well before he
had waved the fruit, I started watering at the mouth, watering at the
mouth in fury, in frenzy &#8211; I Ulysse Mérou, started watering at the
mouth, as though my very life depended on it, such pleasure did I
derive from showing him my intelligence."</b> (from</font><i><font size="2"> Monkey Planet</font></i><font size="2">, trans.  Xan Fielding) </font></blockquote>
<p>Pierre Boulle was born in Avignon, the son of Eugène Boulle, a
lawyer, and Thérèse (Seguin) Boulle. He studied science at the Sorbonne
and then entered the Ecole Supérieure d'Electricité de Paris. After
graduating in 1933 and working then as an engineer, Boulle moved in
1938 to Malaysia, where he was employed as an overseer in a rubber
plantation at 50 miles from Kuala Lumpur. At the outbreak of World War
II, he enlisted with the French army in French Indochina. When German
troops occupied France, Boulle joined the French resistance, de
Gaulle's Free French mission in Singapore, where he received training
as a spy and saboteur. He served as a secret agent under the name Peter
John Rule, a Mauritius-born Englishman, and helped the resistance
movement in China, Burma, and Indochina. </p>
<p>In 1943, Boulle was captured by the Vichy French loyalists on the Mekong 
River, and sentenced 
to "hard labor for life."  However, during his incarceration he also managed to 
keep a diary. With the help of authorities at his prison in Saigon, he escaped in 1944, 
and served until the end of the war in British special forces in Calcutta, India. 
Before returning to France, Boulle continued his work at the 
plantation in Malaysia; he also spent some time in the Cameroons. 
Back in Paris, Boulle 
lived first in a hotel in the Quartier Latin and moved then to the apartment of his widowed sister, 
Madeleine Perrusset. 
</p>
<p>Boulle's 
first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">William Conrad</span>
(1950), was a spy story set in wartime England. Its firsthand
authenticity and ironic portrayal of the British national character
earned critical praise. The title character is a Joseph Conrad-like
Polish emigrant, who actually is a German agent. <i>William Conrad </i>was translated into English 
by Xan Fielding, a former  British Special Operations Executive agent, 
who became Boulle's regular translator. After finishing the thinly autobiographical work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Sacrilège malais</span> (1951, Sacrilege in Malaya), Boulle began writing  <i>The Bridge over the River Kwai</i>, which drew in part on his experiences as a prisoner of war. The novel was awarded the  Prix Sainte-Beuve. 
"I didn't know the River Kwai before I wrote the book," he later confessed. </p>
<p><i>Planet of the Apes</i> was also a world-wide bestseller, but it
owed less to the tradition of King Kong than Voltairean satires. The
story, in which humankind is not the dominant species, was an ironic
comment on the relationship between men and animals. It transferred the
basic relationship between the Japanese soldiers and Allied prisoners &#8211;
the repression of a weaker group by a stronger and its moral effect on
both sides &#8211; into the distant future. </p>
<p>During his prolific career, Boulle wrote more than 30 novels and
short stories. For his literary achievements, he was appointed officer
of the Legion of Honor. His wartime heroism earned him the Croix de
Guerre and a Medal of the Resistance. Boulle never married. In an
interview he once said, that his favorite authors were Joseph Conrad
and Edgar Allan Poe, and his chief relaxation fencing. Boulle died in
Paris on January 30, 1994, at the age of 81. </p>



<p>
 
  In his works, Boulle combined a captivating story with a pessimistic 
view of human endeavors and absurdities.The author himself considered <i>Planet of the Apes</i> one of his 
lesser novels. Beginning as a story inside a story, set in the year 
2500, it first introduces Jinn and Phyllis, a wealthy leisured couple traveling in space. 
They  
find a bottle floating through the void.  Inside is a handwritten manuscript,  
which tells in the spirit of <i>Gulliver's Travels </i>about
Ulysse Mérou, a French journalist. He lands on another planet, where
the apes are intelligent and humans have lost the power of language and
thought. Chimpanzees, gorillas, and orang-utans all have equal rights.
Humans are exhibited in zoos used used as guinea pigs in laboratories.
Some of the planet's scientists refuse to acknowledge, that an animal
has a soul, while according to another view there is only a difference
of degree between the mental processes of beasts and those of monkeys.
Mérou speaks at a scientific congress and tells the astonished
audience: "... I come from a distant planet, from Earth, that Earth on
which, by a whim of nature that has still to be explained, it is men
who are the repositories of wisdom and reason." </p>
<p>The book differs in many ways from Franklin J. Schaffner's film
adaptation, starring Charlton Heston as the astronaut George Taylor.
When Boulle wanted to question our superiority over other animals, the
film reveals in the climax the past and destroyed glory of humankind,
symbolized by the ruined, half-buried remains of the Statue of Liberty.
Boulle himself objected the ending, "I am definitely against it, from
every point of view," he stated in a memo to the producer Arthur P.
Jacobs. After Taylor has learned the truth about the planet, he cries:
"Damn them all to hell!" In the book Mérou returns finally to Earth,
and is received at the airport by a gorilla. Another twist of the tale
is that Jinn and Phyllis are chimpanzees and consider the story
incredible: "Rational men? Men endowed with a mind? Men inspired by
intelligence? No, that's not possible; there the author has gone too
far. But it's a pity!" </p>
<p><i>The Bridge over the River Kwai</i> depicted the true story of
POW's from a Japanese Labor Camp, who are forced to build a bridge for
the Japanese war effort. The grueling work becomes for the prisoners a
means to find again their self-respect, but all their achievements in
turn are just a ridiculous testament of the madness of war. Boulle's
view of the British officers was satirical. Colonel Nicholson is the
perfect example of the military snob. His character was modelled in
part on the Vichy French colonel, who sentenced him to hard labor.
Boulle also examined friendship between individual soldiers, both among
captors and captives, created by the enterprise. As in <i>Planet of the Apes</i>, Boulle 
plays with the Darwinist theme of survival of the fittest. The victorious Japanese 
soldiers cooperate with their prisoners, who want to show their superiority through 
the construction work. </p>

<p>David Lean's sreen adaptation was mostly shot in Ceylon (now Sri
Lanka). At the insistence of the Hollywood producers, Boulle agreed to
add a subplot involving a soldier of fortune (played by William
Holden), who escapes from the camp, and returns with a small band of
volunteers to blow up the bridge. The heroic ending differed from
Boulle's novel, in which the bridge remains standing. When Boulle met
the screenwriter Carl Foreman and the producer Sam Spiegel in London,
he said that he wanted to destroy the bridge but couldn't work out how.
Lean also did not manage to blow it up on the first attempt, and he was
not satisfied with the scene, which closes the picture, looking down on
the shattered bridge and the wrecked train, and James Douglass saying,
"Madness, madness." In one of its most memorable moments, the troops
march into the camp whistling "Colonel Bogey". The song had been
written by a British army officer, Kenneth J. Alford. It became a great
hit, particularly after Mitch Miller &amp; His Orchestera made their
popular recording. Malcolm Arnold, who composed the score, was
classically trained, also known for the music he wrote for such films
as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Captain's Paradise</span> (1953), <span style="font-style: italic;">Trapeze</span> (1956), <span style="font-style: italic;">Island in the Sun</span> (1957), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Inn of the Sixth Happiness</span> (1958), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tunes of Glory</span> (1960). </p>
<p><i>The 
Bridge on the River Kwai </i>was nominated for eight
Academy Awards. For his great surprise, Boulle received an Oscar for
the best screenplay, although he had written not one line of it. The
real authors were Carl Foreman, and Michael Wilson, a blacklisted
writer, who posthumously received the Academy Award in 1985. Sam
Spiegel, the producer, had given the credit for the script to Boulle,
because Columbia would not empoy blacklisted writers. Spiegel had told
him that it was his book on the screen, "that he had just put a few
camera angles on it and what do you care?"<font size="2"> 
(Carl Foreman in</font><i><font size="2"> David Lean: A Biography </font></i><font size="2">by Kevin Brownlow, 1986) 
</font>Moreover, Lean made up a story about Boulle and himself in Paris, to 
explain how a novelist, who did not have much film experience, could 
produce such a work. Boulle did not attend the ceremony, when the 
awards were presented at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. Michael Wilson later adapted <i>Planet of the Apes</i> for the 1968 Franklin J. Schaffner film. </p>

<p>Boulle's later works include<i> La Baleine des Malouines</i> (1983, The Whale of the Victoria Cross), 
a story of a heroic blue whale, nicknamed "Auntie Margot", and naval warfare in the Falklands. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Photographe</span> (1967,  The Photographer) a former Algerian war veteran is obsessed by opportunity to take the ultimate picture, 
"a unique document", as he discovers that his friend wants to murder the President.<i> Quia absurdum 
</i>(1970, Because it is Absurd) was a collection of short 
stories. One of its tales, 'His Last Battle', told about Hitler, 
who lives with Eva Braun in the mountains of Peru. At the end he 
says to Martin Bormann, "The Jews, Bormann, the Jews &#8211;  
I have forgiven them."  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Aux sources de la rivière Kwaï</span> (1966, My Own River Kwai) 
Boulle returned to his war experiences in the Far East. <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Ilon</span> (1990) was a book of  childhood 
memories from the family's cottage of Ilon on the Rhône. The director Otto Preminger planned to film <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Voies du salut</span>
(1958, The Other Side of the Coin), about a wounded female guerrilla,
and an American woman, the wife of a rubber plantation manager, who
tries to reform her. The project was never realized, but Preminger
casted Au Kar Wai, a 19-year-old Chinese star of Shaw Brothers films,
to play the rebel. </p>
