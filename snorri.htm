<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Icelandic poet, historian, the best-known
writer of the saga, author of the Prose Edda, which was written as a
textbook for young poets who wished to praise kings, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Heimskringla</span>, a history of the
kings of Norway, the most important prose collection in Old Norse
literature. Snorri expanded one of its sections into a separate <span style="font-style: italic;">Olaf's Saga</span>. Like most sagas, <span style="font-style: italic;">Egil's Saga</span> is anonymous but it is
thought to have been written by Snorri Sturluson in about 1230. Its
greatest poem is 'Lament for My Sons' in which Egil honors his dead
sons in verse. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>The rough storm has robbed me </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Of my best riches, </font><br>
<font size="2">It's cruel to recall </font><br>

<p>Snorri Sturluson, who belonged to the powerful Sturlunga
family, was a descendant of the poet and hero from <i>Egil's Saga</i>,
Egill Skallgrímsson. He grew up in the home of the most influential
chieftain of Iceland, Jón Loptsson, and acquired a deep knowledge of
Icelandic tradition and history. His father died in 1197. Two years
later Snorri married Herdis, who came from a wealthy family. In the
following years Snorri devoted himself to enlarging his estate,
eventually gaining the position of one of the richest men in the
country. </p>
<p>In 1206 Snorri settled at Reykjaholt. His marriage was not
happy. Herdis lived at Borg until her death in 1233. In Reykjahold
Snorri wrote most of his works between 1223-1235. Between 1215-18 and
1222-32 he was the chairman of the Icelandic high court. From 1218-1220
he was in Norway, invited by the young and inexperienced King Haakon
IV, who ruled from 1217 to 1263. However, at that time the most
powerful man was Haakon's half-brother Jarl Skule. During this period
Snorri got deeply involved in political intrigues. He signed to
Norway's supremacy over Iceland and perhaps he started to plan to write
a saga about the ancient kings. In his homeland Snorri was called a
traitor. </p>
<p>After returning to Iceland Snorri was involved in a number of
quarrels. In court Snorri lost most of his cases and acquired many
enemies. Several of them came from his own family. He had illegitimate
children and lived with a widow, whose land he had incorporated with
his own. Because he was not active enough in persuading his countrymen
to accept Norway's domination, Haakon's suspicions arose. However, he
carried out an agreement to protect Norwegian merchants in Iceland. In
1237 Snorri returned to Norway, and joined the opposition against the
king. Although Haakon banned all Icelanders from leaving Norway, Snorri
sailed in 1239 back to Iceland, where his former son-in-law, Gizurr
Thórvaldsson, was his most prominent enemy and ally of the king. Haakon
demanded that Snorri should be brought to Norway or killed if he
refused to obey him. On September 11, 1241, he was assassinated by
Haakon´s order in Gut Reykjaholt. The killer was Árni Beiskur, who hit
Snorri with an axe. "Don't strike," were Snorri's last words. He died
unarmed in his own cellar. Snorri's fate has been compared to that of
Cicero in ancient Rome &#8211; also Snorri has remained in history, but not
as a great statesman or an orator, but as a great writer. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I've no doubt that if you join
Harald's men, you'll prove yourself a match for them all, and as good a
man as the bravest of them in every danger. Just take care not to be
too ambitious. Never try to compensate with men greater than yourself,
but never give way to them either." </b></font><font size="2">(Egil's
grandfather Kveldulf in <i>Egil's Saga</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p><i>Heimskringla</i> contains sixteen sagas of Norwegian
history and records the kings of Norway from the earliest times to
1177, as well as a collection of their sagas and poems. Its name comes
from its opening words, 'Kringla heimsins', the 'circle of the world.'
"Odin established the same law in his land that had been in force in
Asaland. Thus he established by law that all dead men should be burned,
and their belongings laid with them upon the pile, and the ashes be
cast into the sea or buried in the earth. Thus, said he, every one will
come to Valhalla with the riches he had with him upon the pile; and he
would also enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Heimskringla</font></i><font size="2">) </font> One of Snorri's sources was a lost work called <i>Hryggjarstykki</i>,
written by Eiríkr Oddson. The only historian Snorri mentions in his
foreword is Ari Thorgilsson, "the first man in this country to write in
the Norse tongue about lore both ancient and recent."</p>
<p><i>Prose Edda</i>, also called the <i>Snorra Edda</i>
includes in the first part, <i>Gylfaginning</i>, an account of the
creation of the world and of pagan poetry, stories about the gods in
the second section, explanation of the special vocabulary used in
poetry, a poem about King Hákon and Earl Skúli Bárðarson, and technical
analysis of meters. The second, <i>Skaldskaparmál</i>, and the third
part, <i>Háttatal</i>, can be read as an introduction to the art of
writing poetry. Snorri's work preserved in three relatively complete
manuscripts: <i>Codex Upsaliensis</i>, perhaps a direct copy of
Snorri's own text, <i>Codex Regius</i>, dated palaeographically to
about 1270-1280, and <i>Codex Wormianus</i>, from the middle of the
fourteenth century. Most translations are based on the <i>Codex Regius</i>,
which is made from several collections of poems. The first translation
of Snorri's work, entitled <i> Edda islandorum an Chr 1213 islandice
conscripta per Snorronem Sturlæ, nunc prinium islandice, danice, et
latine ex antiquis codicibus in lucem prodit opera p. J. Resinii</i>,
was published in 1665 in Copenhagen. G.W. Dasent's incomplete English
version of <i>Snorra Edda</i> was published in Stockholm in 1842. <i>Egil's
Saga </i>starts with King Harald Fine-Hair's establishment of
Norwegian unity at the cost of tyranny and war, and closes in Iceland,
honoring the achievement of the founding fathers of the Icelandic
nation. The saga embraces five generations, from Egil's grandfather
Kveldulf to his grandson Skuli. Egil is a poet, drunkard, lawyer and
farmer, he performs his first murder at the age of six and is the most
individual character in the Icelandic Sagas. Odin has given Egil the
power of words but taken away his two sons. Thorgerd, his daughter,
manipulates her father back to the acceptance of life and writing about
his suffering.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Gofumk íþrótt </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">

<font size="2">

<font size="2">

<font size="2">
(from 'Sonatorrek' by Egil Skallagrímsson) </font></blockquote>
<p>Snorri gives a detailed description of Egill's physical appearance: "He
had a broad forehead and large brows, a nose that was not long but
enormously thick, and lips that, seen through his beard, were both wide
and long. He had a remarkably broad chin, and this largeness continued
throughout the jawbone. He was thick-necked and broad-shouldered and,
more so than other men, he was hard-looking and fierce when angry." A
skull thought to be that of Egill was unearthed in Mosfell about 150
years after Egil's death. The skull was described as "ridged all over
like a scallop shell." It has been suggested that Egill suffered from
Paget's disease of bone or from Van Buchem's disease. Dr Darris Wills,
a linguist and historian, has argued that this and other descriptions
of physical features in sagas "served as 'mugshots' of likely offenders
and a warning to wider Viking society."</p>
      <p>The word "saga" is Norse for "tale". Most sagas are adventure
tales, essentially retellings of Scandinavian history and folktales in
narrative form. If the attribution is correct, <i>Egil's saga</i> is
the only one whose author is known. Original sagas were Nordic and
Icelandic, written in the 11-14th centuries. The genre covers a wide
range of material distinguished primarily by subject matter. The family
sagas deal with historical events that occurred in Icelandic and Norway
during the period of settlement, from about 870 to 1050. Primarily
biographical are <i>Egil's Saga</i>,<i> Grettir's Saga</i>, (11th
century, translated in verse by <a href="wmorris.htm">William Morris</a>),
and <i>Gisli's saga</i>, from the early 13th century. The poems of the
<i>Elder Edda</i> are very old and pagan &#8211; poems derived from the
<i>Eddas</i> drew heavily on myths and legends. Famous sagas: <i>Burnt
Njál Saga</i> (11th century), <i>Volsunga Saga</i> (final form 13th
century), Snorri Sturluson's <i>Heimskringla</i>. Science fiction
writer Poul Anderson has retold <i>Hrolf Kragi's Saga</i> in 1973.
Several Scandinavian writers have imitated the devices of the saga in
historical fiction. Of these, <a href="undset.htm">Sigrid Undset</a>'s
<i>Kristin Lavransdotter trilogy</i> (1920-22), including <i>Kranse</i>
(The Garland), <i>Husfrue</i> (The Mistress of Husaby), and <i>Korset</i>
(The Cross) is best known. In the United States O.E. Rolvaag's <i>Giants
in the Earth</i> and its sequels make use of multigenerational
motivation. </p>
