      <p>The most celebrated Portuguese poet, who had a major role in
the development of modernism in his country. Fernando Pessoa was a
member of the Modernist group <i>Orpheu</i>; he was its greatest
representative. Pessoa's use of "heteronyms," literary alter egos, who
support and criticize each other's works was also unconventional.
During his career Pessoa was virtually unknown and he published little
of his vast body of work. Most of his life Pessoa lived in a furnished
room in Lisbon, where he died in obscurity. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>I never kept sheep, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">But it's as if I'd done so. </font><br>
        <font size="2">My soul is like a shepherd. </font><br>

        <font size="2">(from 'I never kept sheep,' <i>The Keeper of
Sheep</i>, 1914) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa was born in Lisbon. His
father, Joaquim de Seabra Pessoa, died of tuberculosis when Pessoa was
young. At the age of five or six Pessoa began to address letters to an
imaginary companion, named Le Chevalier de Pas, the precursor of hís
other imaginary figures. Maria Madalena Nogueira Pessoa, his mother,
married the Portuguese consul in Durban in South Africa, where the
family lived from 1896. During these years Pessoa became fluent in
English and developed an early love for such authors as William
Shakespeare and John Milton. He also composed his early poems in
English. In a letter to the editor of the <span style="font-style: italic;">British Journal of Astrology</span>,
Pessoa confessed that English education had been a factor of supreme
importance in his life. However, his best poems he wrote in Portuguese. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Pessoa
was educated in Cape Town. At the age of seventeen he
returned to Lisbon to continue his studies at the university.&nbsp; By
the time he was fourteen he was sending riddles to a newspaper under
the pseudonym 'Dr Pancrácio' (Dr Simpleton). When a
student strike interrupted classes, he gave up his studies, and got
employment as a business correspondent. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1919 Pessoa met Ophélia
Queiroz, a nineteen years old secretary; they exchanged letters but in
November 1920 Pessoa broke off with her. Unlike a number of
romantically inclined poets, he never produced a body of love poetry
addressed to her.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>With his mother, and his half sister Henriquetta, Pessoa
rented an apartment on the Rua Coelho de Rocha, 16, where he lived
until his death. Pessoa never married. In a letter in the 1930s, he
stated that sexual desires are "a hindrance to superior mental
processes." However, his own sexual orientation obsessed him. </p>
      <p>Pessoa
set up a small printing company called 'Ibis' with the money he
inherited from his grandmother, but the business failed. He used to
embrass his family by standing on one leg and shooring out "I am an
ibis". Outside his familily he had no close friendships; the heteronyms
replaced the contacts with real people.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
      <p>Pessoa earned a modest living as a commercial translator, and
wrote avant-garde reviews, especially for <i>Orpheu</i>, which was a
forum for new aesthetic views. His articles in praise of the <i>saudosismo</i>
(nostalgia) movement provoked polemics because of their extravagant
language. Pessoa's first book, <em>Antinous</em>, came out in 1918,
and was followed by two other collection of poems, all written in
English. It was not until 1933 that he published his first book, the
slim, prize-winning <em>Mensagem</em>, in Portuguese. However, it did
not attract much attention. </p>

      <p>The bulk of Pessoa's oeuvre appeared in literary magazines,
especially in his own <i>Athena</i>. In John Murry's <span style="font-style: italic;">Athenaeum</span> his work appeared only
once; the magazine ceased publication in 1921. 'Spell,' published in
May 1923 in <span style="font-style: italic;">Contemporanea</span>,
was the last of his English poems to achieve print in his lifetime. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Before creating his literary personalities from his inner
discordant voices, Pessoa had long had doubts about his own sanity.
Under his own name Pessoa wrote poems that are marked by their
innovative language, although he used traditional stanza and metric
patterns. The poetical technique for which Pessoa has become especially
noted is the use of heteronyms, or alternative literary personae,
resembling the verse personae of <a href="epound.htm">Ezra Pound</a>.
or Søren Kierkegaard's "characters" who actually "authored" some of his
books. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Pessoa's own family name means both person and persona. He
considered that a "heteronymic work is by an author writing outside his
own personality: it is the work of&nbsp; complete individuality made up
by him, or just as the uttersances of some character in a drama would
be." It must be said, that Pessoa did not suffer from schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Much of his best work Pessoa attributed later to his
heteronyms, de Campos, Reis, and Caeiro, who were partly born as a
prank on Mário Sá-Carneiro (1890-1916), an avant-garde poet from <i>Orpheu</i>.
Álvaro de Campos, an engineer, represents in the spirit of Walt Whitman
the ecstasy of experience; he writes in free verse. Ricardo Reis is an
epicurean doctor with a classical education; he writes in meters and
stanzas that recall Horace. (See also <a href="saramago.htm">Jose
Saramago</a>'s novel <i>The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis</i>,
1984.) Some of the minor heteronyms were exotic, like the Baron of
Tieve, a suicidal aristocrat, or Jean Seul de Méluret, and essyist with
an interest in dancing girls. One is a woman &#8211;&nbsp; Maria José, a
tubercular hunchback with a crippled leg. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Alberto Caeiro, who called himself a shepherd, is against all
sentimentality, and writes in colloquial free verse. By the birth of
this heteronym, Pessoa had published two books of poetry, <span style="font-style: italic;">35 Sonnets, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Antinous</span>. Caeiro appeared in him
suddenly: "I found myself before a tall chest of drawers, took up a
piece of paper, began to write, remaining upright all the while since I
always stand when I can." Beginning with a title, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Keeper of Sheep</span>, Pessoa
produced over 30 poems in a single go. He then wrote the six poems that
make up 'Oblique Rain.' <br>
      </p>
      <p> Caeiro had two disciples, Ricardo Reis and Álvaro de Campos,
who says melancholically in 'The Tobacconist's' (1928): "I am nothing.
/ I shall always be nothing." According to Reis, "The life of Caeiro
cannot be told for there is nothing in it to tell." Pessoa once
informed that Caeiro died from tuberculosis in 1915. After meeting him
on March 8, 1914, Pessoa began to write poetry. In 'I never kept sheep'
Caeiro said: "I've no ambitions or desires. / My being a poet isn't an
ambition. / It's my way of being alone." Each persona has a distinct
philosophy of life. Pessoa even created literary discussions among
them. </p>
      <p>In 'Toward Explaining Heteronomity' Pessoa criticized the
distinction made between three generic types or classes of poetry &#8211; <i>epic</i>
or <i>narrative</i>, in which the narrator speaks in the first person,
      <i>drama</i>, in which the characters do all the talking, and<i>
lyric</i>, uttered through the first person. "Like all well conceived
classifications, this one is useful and clear; like all
classifications, it is false. The genres do not separate out with
essential facility, and, if we closely analyze what they are made of,
we shall find that from lyric poetry to dramatic there is one
continuous gradation. In effect, and going right to the origins of
dramatic poetry &#8211; Aeschylus, for instance &#8211; it will be nearer the truth
to say that what we encounter is lyric poetry put into the mouths of
different characters."</p>
      <p>Pessoa died on November 30, 1935, in Lisbon. Throughout his
life, Pessoa kept himself aloof from the literary world, but he
followed keenly foreign literary movements. "There are many cultured
persons in Portugal, but there are no <span style="font-style: italic;">cultural
milieu</span>," he once said. One of Pessoa's pen friends was the
English writer and occult figure <a href="crowley.htm">Aleister Crowley</a>,
known as "the Great Beast" &#8211; their correspondence began in 1930.
Crowley signed his letters "666". In the 1910s Pessoa had practiced
mediumistic writing, claiming once that his uncle, Manuel Gualdino da
Cunha, had used his hand to make a signature. Many of Pessoa's
questions to the spirits dealt with his own sex life. One of them
mocked him, "You masturbator! You masochist! You man without manhood!"
In his library Pessoa had E.G. Stanley's book <i>Amativeness: The
Master Passion of Life</i>, which warned about the effects of
masturbation. Although Pessoa later came into the conclusion, that his
method of communication with spirits was self-deceptive, he continued
to experiment with automatic writing, which was in France an important
part of the Surrealist techniques. </p>
      <p>Pessoa
left behind some 25,000 unpublished text and fragments, both poetry and
prose, everything from horoscopes to detective stories.
From the 1940s, his poetry started to gain a wider audience in Portugal
and later Brazil. Several of his collections have been published
posthumously and translated in Spanish, French, English, German,
Swedish, Finnish, and other languages. Among the most important works
are&nbsp;<em>Poesias de Fernando Pessoa</em> (1942), <em>Poesias de
Álvaro de Campos</em> (1944), <em>Poemas de Alberto Caeiro</em>
(1946), and&nbsp;<em>Odes de Ricardo Reis</em> (1946). Pessoa's work
has inspired writers such as the South-African poet Roy Campbell
(1901-1957), the Nobel laureate José Saramago (1922-2010), and the
Italian novelist and short story writer <a href="tabucchi.htm">Antonio
Tabucchi</a> (1943-2012) <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Quando vim a ter espenranças, já
não sabia ter esperanças. </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Quando vim a olhar para a vida, perdera o
sentido da vida." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Aniveresario') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Known above all as a poet, Pessoa also wrote short essays,
several of which were briefly sketched or unfinished. His most
significant work <em>Livro do Desassossego</em> (The Book of
Disquiet), the "factless autobiography," was found in an envelope.
Written under the name Bernardo Soares, which was on the title page, it
appeared for the first time in 1982, almost 50 years after the author's
death. <i>The Book of Disquiet</i> is a collection of prose
manuscripts, written in the style of an intimate diary. Bernardo Soares
is troubled by alienation and experiences of drowning: "And I, truly, I
am the center that doesn't exist except as a convention in the geometry
of the abyss; I am the nothingness around which this movement spins..."
Soares praises the literary magazine to which Pessoa contributes, he
loves and hates his city, but cannot break out of his monotonous life. </p>
