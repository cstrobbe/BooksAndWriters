<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American poet, noted for his complex, oratorical poetry, and turbulent life. Lowell was called the father
of the confessional poets, a term used to describe among others <a href="/splath.htm">Sylvia Plath</a>,
Anne Sexton, and John Berryman. Lowell's work grew from his own
unhappiness and the social, political, and ideological movements in the
U.S. during the Post World War II decades. He was a heavy drinker, and
was married three times. From 1949 the manic-depressive Lowell spent
periods in mental hospitals. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Robert Lowell was born in Boston, the son of Robert Traill Spence
Lowell, a naval officer, and Charlotte (Winslow) Lowell, the dominating
figure in Robert's childhood. Other members of the distinguished,
intellectual family included the poet and critic James Russell Lowell
and the poet Amy Lowell. Robert was nicknamed Cal, partly after the
Roman emperor Caligula, known for his cruelty, and Caliban, familiar
from Shakespeare's play <i>The Tempest</i>.</p>
<p>Lowell began writing at St. Mark's School, where his teacher was
Richard Eberhart. At school he penned an essay entitled 'War: A
Justification', foreshadowing his belligerent way of life. While
studying English literature at Harvard, Lowell
met <a href="/rfrost.htm">Robert Frost</a>, who was delivering the
Norton lectures there, and asked his opinion about a long poem (the
subject was the First Crusade) he had written in longhand on lined
paper.
Despite the clumsy effort, Frost recognized Lowell's talent, and helped
him on a number of occasions. Lowell became Frost's closest friend
among the younger poets. Frost also visited Lowell in a mental hospital
in 1949. </p>
<p>When Lowell's parents rejected the woman he proposed to marry, he
broke from his family. On the advice of a psychiatrist, he transferred
to Kenyon College (Ohio). There he studied poetry and criticism,
graduating in 1940. His teachers included John Crowe Ransom
(1888-1974), who was a member of the Agrarian Movement. In 1940 Lowell
converted Roman Catholicism and married against his parents' will the
writer Jean Stafford &#8211; they divorced eight years later. In 1949 Lowell
married the novelist and critic Elisabeth Hardwick. However, two years
earlier Lowell had met the poet Elizabet Bishop, who influenced deeply
his work. Lowell fantasized marrying her and dedicated to Bishop his
poem 'Skunk Hour' in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Life Studies </span>(1959):
"Thirsting for / the hierarchic privacy / of Queen Victoria's century,
/ she buys up all / the eyesores facing her shore, / and lets them
fall." </p>
<p>At Kenyon College Lowell met his lifelong friends Peter Taylor and
Randall Jarrell. After graduating, Lowell moved on a fellowship to
Louisiana State University, where he worked with Robert Penn Warren and
Cleanth Brooks. Although Lowell tried to enlist in the armed forces
during WW II, he declared himself a conscientious objector by the time
he was called for service. Lowell's decision was based on his religious
beliefs; he had become a Catholic in 1941, and argued that by bombing
civilians, the United States had ceased to fight a defensive war and
thus it could not be justified by the church. In 1943 Lowell served
five months of a prison sentence for refusing the draft, first at the
West Street Jail in New York City, then at the Federal Correctional
Center in Danbury, Connecticut. After being granted parole, Lowell
served in Bridgeport, CT, where he cleaned the nurses' quarters at St.
Vincent's Hospital. It is possible that the experiences of imprisonment
played some role when his mental health later collapsed. To his time in
Danbury Lowell returned in such poems as 'In the Cage' (1946) and
'Rats'. </p>
<p>In his first collection of poetry, the autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">Land of Unlikeness</span> (1944), Lowell used Christian symbolism and juxtaposed the world of grace to the urban life. His second book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lord Weary's Castle</span>
(1946), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, marked a return to the
New England milieu. It included the famous 'The Quaker Graveyard in
Nantucket.' "This is the end of running on the waves; / We are poured
out like water. Who will dance / The mast-lashed master of Leviathans /
Up from this field of Quakers in their graves?" This poem referred to
such sources as Henry David Thoreau's<i> Cape Cod</i>, Herman Melville's <i>Moby-Dick</i>,
and the Bible. Captain Ahab and his pursuit of the great whale is a
central image. Some poems had religious themes, such as 'The Holy
Innocents' and 'Christmas in Black Rock'. he wrote a love poem,
'Walking in the Blue'. Upon hearing of the success of his protégé,
Frost said: "Isn't it fine that the young promise I began to entertain
hopes of when it visited me on Fayerweather Street Cambridge in 1936,
should have come to so much and to so much promise for the future?" </p>
<p>These two early books are among Lowell's confessional works, others were <span style="font-style: italic;">Life Studies</span> (1959), which won the National Book Award in 1960, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dolphin </span>(1973). <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mills of The Kavanaughs </span>(1949),
which blended classical myths with New England landscape, contained a
narrative poem of some 600 lines and five other pieces. </p>
<p>With <a href="/bishop.htm">Elizabeth Bishop</a>, whose <i>North &amp; South</i>
(1946) had been received with critical acclaim, Lowell kept up
correspondence from 1947 until his death. In 1949 Lowell was
hospitalized for mania at Baldpate Hospital in Georgetown,
Massachusetts. From his padded cell he wrote in a letter: "I'm in grand
shape.... The world is full of wonders." In McLean's Hospital, during
one of his periodic incarcerations, he composed his famous love poem
'Walking in the Blue' for Anne Adden, whom he met in the hospital.
Lowell, who suffered from bipolar disorder, was treated with
electroconvulsive therapy (also known as electroshock or ECT). In his
manic period he allegedly once held the poet Allen Tate out of a
second-storey window while reciting 'Ode to the Confederate Dead'. <br>
 </p>
<p> Lowell received the Harriet Monroe Poetry award in 1952 and the
Guinness Poetry Award (shared with W.H. Auden, Edith Sitwell, and Edwin
Muir) in 1959. In the 1950s, Lowell spent a few years abroad. He
settled in 1954 in Boston, where he worked as a teacher at the
University of Boston (1955-60). While in Boston, Sylvia Plath attended
a poetry seminar run by Lowell. During this decade he was a visiting
lecturer at the University of Cincinnati and Harvard University. The
1950s saw also the emergence of the Beat Generation, but in Boston the
influence of the movement was not earth-shattering.</p>
<p>Lowell's interest in  the history  led him to translate such writers as  Racine, Sappho, <a href="/rmrilke.htm">Rilke</a>, and <a href="/baudelai.htm">Baudelaire</a>.  He also produced versions of poems by such Russian writers as Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam. The trio of plays entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">The Old Glory</span>
&#8211; adapted for the stage from the stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne and
Herman Melville &#8211; reflected Lowell's preoccupation with dilemmas of the
American past. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lowell wrote a number
of unrhymed sonnets, in which he explored his own literary career.
These works he published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Notebook 1967-68</span> (1969) and in revised form in <span style="font-style: italic;">Notebook</span> (1970). </p>


<p>In the 1960s Lowell was active in the civil-rights and antiwar
campaigns. He made a number of widely published political gestures,
refusing among others to attend the White House Festival of the Arts
because of opposition to the Vietnam war. "Every serious artist knows
that he cannot enjoy public celebration without making public
commitments," he once said. From 1963 to 1970 he was a teacher at
Harvard. </p>

<p>In 1972 Lowell divorced from his second wife. During the 1970s Lowell lived   in England, where he was a visiting 
fellow at All Souls College, Oxford (1970), and visiting lecturer at the University of Essex (1970-72) and at 
the University of Kent (1970-1975). In 1973 Lowell published  three collections of poetry. <span style="font-style: italic;">History </span>recreated a host of historical figures from biblical times to the present. In <span style="font-style: italic;">For Lizzie and Harriet</span>
he talked about his second wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, and his daughter.
In 'Harriet', Lowell kills a fly, whamming back and forth across the
nursery bed, "... and another instant's added / to the horrifying
mortmain of / ephemera: keys, drift, sea-urchin shells, / you packrat
off with joy... a dead fly swept / under the carpet, wrinkling to
fulfillment." <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Dolphin</span>
dealt with the poet's move to England as he left one wife for another.
The third collection brought him another Pulitzer Prize, but he
reviewers criticized him for using excerpts from his wife letters. The
title poem was a celebration of feelings of love &#8211; the person behind
the collection was Lowell's third wife, the writer Caroline Blackwood,
of England's Guinness family. They had one child. Caroline had divorced
twice; her first husband was the painter Lucian Freud, and her second
was the composer Israel Citkowitz. </p>

<p>Lowell died of heart failure in a taxi  on September 12, 1977, in New York, clutching  
Lucian Freud's portrait of his wife, named 'Girl in Bed'. At the time of his death, he was 
returning to his former wife and his daughter, after breaking with Caroline. His last collection was <span style="font-style: italic;">Day by Day</span>, 
in which  he used free verse like he had done in his early works. Lowell's record of his  domestic history 
received posthumously in 1978 the National Book Critics Circle Award. </p>
