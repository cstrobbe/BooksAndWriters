<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->One of the most independent and
influential Italian writers
of the mid-20th century. Like many young Italians in the 1920s,
Malaparte converted to fascism. He also manifested his political views
in his own magazine <i>Prospettive</i> (1937) and other publications.
Malaparte's early fiction was pro-fascist, but toward the end of his
life he showed understanding of Maoism. Malaparte's best book, <em>Kaputt</em>
(1944), partly written in Finland during World War II, contrasted with
grotesque humor the elegant pessimism of its cosmopolitan characters
and the suffering the war caused to masses of people.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"People who live in Capri do not
know, do not realize (until they leave) the paradise they live in. I
have not spent a real summer in Capri since 1938. In 1939 I was in
Amalfi, back from Ethiopia, with a rheumatism on my right side that was
making me suffer horribly. In 1940 I was on Mont Blanc. In 1941 I was
in Russia. In 1942 I was in Lapland; and this year I am in Sweden and
Finland. And at least this year, I would like to enjoy Capri's summer
in my own house, before I become too old."</b> (from Malaparte's letter
to Carlo A. Talamona, in </font><i><font size="2">Casa Malaparte</font></i><font size="2"> by Marida Talamona, 1992) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Curzio Malaparte was born Kurt Erich Suckert in Prato, near
Florence. His mother was an Italian, and his father, Erwin Suckert, a
German Protestant. Until the age of six, Malaparte lived with foster
parents, in the household of the metalworker Milziade Baldi. Later in
life he recalled these years with affection and warmth. At the age of
thirteen, Malaparte entered the Ciognini College, Prato, where read
such classics as Homer and Virgil, and Mazzini, and Garibaldi, the two
heroes of the <i>risorgimento</i>. In 1911 he joined the junior branch
of the Republican Party. </p>
      <p>At the age of sixteen Malaparte enlisted in the Garibaldian
League and served on the French front until May 1915. He then
transferred to the Italian army and fought with the Alpine troops. In
1918 he was exposed to the mustard gassed on the French front, and was
hospitalized for three months. The damage to the lungs most likely
caused his cancer and untimely death. After returning to the front, he
assumend command of the 94th Section of Flamethrowers. For his bravery,
Malaparte was awarded the French Cross as an <i>officer de grande
valeur</i>. </p>
      <p>After the war Malaparte started his career as a journalist.
From 1922 until the fall of Mussolini in 1943 Malaparte was an active
member of the Fascist Party, participating in the seizure of Florence
and the march of Rome. In 1924 Malaparte founded the Roman periodical <i>La
Conquista dello stato, </i>and two years later he founded with Massimo
Bontempelli (1878-1960) the literary quarterly <i>'900</i>, which
championed progress, technology, and the urban environment. In the late
1920s he became a coeditor of <i>Fiera Letteraria</i> (1928-31), and
in Turin an editor of the daily <i>La Stampa</i>, turning it into a
fascist publication. Malaparte's individual writings earned him enemies
in the Fascist party and in 1931 he was dismissed from his post. </p>
      <p>Malaparte published his first books in the early 1920s; his
pen name was a pun on Bonaparte. The war novel<em> </em><span class="st"><em>La rivolta dei santi maledetti</em>&nbsp; </span>(1921)
was an interpretation of the Italian defeat at Caporetto and criticized
the corrupt Rome as the real enemy. When it suited him, Malaparte
didn't hesitate to take controversial, even contradictory stands. He
advocated cosmopolitan views with Bontempelli and defended parochialism
and rural values.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; Technique du Coup d'État</em>&nbsp;
(1931) attacked both Hitler and Mussolini. Anticipating that he had
managed to enrage&nbsp;Il Duce, Malaparte&nbsp;took an extended&nbsp;to
Paris. This book was one reason that led to his 'internal exile' on the
island of Lipari, but what&nbsp; finally prompted the authorities to
act was Malaparte's slander on Italo Balbo, Marshal of the Air Force.
Balbo was Italy's hero of long-distance aviation, </p>
      <p>By the help of the businessman Count Caleazzo Ciano, who
married Mussolini's daughter Edda,&nbsp;Malaparte was moved from
Lipari, "horrible under the semi-African sun and an unimaginable wind",
to Ischia &#8211; "this tenderly green Ischia, gossiply, pretentious, for
holidays and <i>dopolavoro </i>outings," as he wrote. There he bought
himself a small stone house. "I've started working again," Malaparte
wrote to one of his friends, "I am burning up with desire to work, I
have got a new taste for life and struggle (literary struggle, let it
be clear...)". Eventually Malaparte was freed on the personal
intervention of Mussolini's son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano. </p>
      <p>After being released from custody,&nbsp;Malaparte founded the
cultural journal <i>Prospettive</i>, which was viewed with suspicion
by the authorities.&nbsp;His forum for international, modernist
literature published works by Apollinaire, Claudel, Beckett, Breton,
Eliot, Heidegger, Kafka, Lorca, Rilke, Sartre, and other new voices. To
celebrate Christmas, Malaparte returned to Capri. From 1938 onwards,
Malaparte was allowed to make foreign trips. At the outbreak of the
war, he was recalled to service, but in an admimistrative role. He saw
action on the Franco-Italian front and was allowed to travel relatively
freely in the territories occupied by Germany. </p>
      <p>Malaparte's house in Capri, sited on a promontory overlooking
the Mediterranean Sea, and designed by the author himself, has been
called the most beautiful house in the world. The director Jean-Luc
Godard filmed there <i>Le Mépris</i>, his adaptation of Alberto
Moravia's novel<i> Il Disprezzo</i>, starring Brigitte Bardot, Michel
Piccoli, and Jack Palance. Casa Malaparte, 28 meters long and 6.6
meters wide, was built on the windy and barren cliff of Massulto. As a
manifestation of modern achitecture, it rejected the popular "Capri
style." Malaparte worked busily with his house project between 1938 and
1942, and in November 1942 he announced that "the house is about
finished..." Actually, it was not. One of his friends later told that
Malaparte was always broke, because there was always a wall, or a
bathroom, or a window to redo. In <em>La Pelle</em> (1949, The Skin)
Malaparte fabricated a story that the German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel
had visited the house before the battle of El Alamein. The legendary
tank commander asked if the writer had desingned the house. Pointing
towards the sea, Malaparte said&nbsp;he had only created the scenery. </p>
      <p>Throughout his life, Malaparte was a traveller. Occasionally
he sent postcards to his dogs. For a relatively long period, he lived
with Virginia Agnelli, the widow of the founder of Fiat cars. Malaparte
had a great success with women, and after Agnelli, he chased younger
women who gave him the stimulus he needed. During the World War II
Malaparte worked as a correspondent for <i>Corriere della Sera</i>. He
made a sojourn to East Africa in 1939 and spent a short time in Greece,
where he wrote a series of articles about human rights abuses. The
Fascist and Nazi authorities were not happy with Malaparte's reports,
but he was granted exclusive rights to follow the advancing German
troops in the Soviet Union in daily articles. Malaparte's
correspondence from France in 1940-41 was collected in <em>Il sole è
cieco</em> (1947) and from the USSR in 1941-42 in <em>Il Volga nasce
in Europa</em><strong> </strong>(1943). Nearly all the copies of this
edition, published by Bompiani, were destroyed by British bombs. The
book was printed again, but this time it was banned and burned by the
German authorities. Then it was reprinted in 1951, with a foreword by
the author. The reviewer for the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> said
of <i>The Volga Rises in Europe</i>, "...it convincingly confirms
Malaparte's right, whatever his faults, to be one of the most brilliant
reporters of out time." </p>
      <p>Malaparte was in Finland when he heard the news of Mussolini's
fall. He returned immediately to Italy, and in July he was taken to the
Regina Coeli prison, where he asked the same cell he had occupied in
1933. Malaparte was released in August and he settled in Capri. After
the allied landed on the island, he was arrested again &#8211; before the end
of the war he experienced it several times. In 1944 he hosted in his
house Palmiro Togliatti, who drafted his speech for the meeting of the
Communist party officials in Naples. During the last months of the war
Malaparte worked as the Italian Army Contingent liaison officer with
the Allied Command. Under the pseudonym of Gianni Strozzi he published
in the leftist magazine <i>L'Unita </i>a series of articles on the
liberation of Florence. </p>
      <p>His international fame Malaparte established with two war
novels:<i> Kaputt</i>, and <em>The Skin</em>, its sequel, which was
placed on the index of books forbidden to Roman Catholics. Episodic <i>Kaputt</i>
was based on his own experiences as a journalist in the uniform of a
Captain of the Italian army. Malaparte's observations centered on the
Fascist elite, Nazi collaborators and high officials in places like
Finland or Romania. In the relentless account of Europe crumbling under
the war Malaparte depicted frozen horses on the Lake Ladoga at the
Finnish front, life in the Warsaw ghetto, politicians behind the war
scene, and degenerate diplomatic corps. It also included an account of
the massacre of the Jews in Iasi, Romania, in 1941 &#8211; perhaps the first
important literary treatment of the Holocaust. The book became a
bestseller and was translated into ten languages, among others into
Finnish in the 1960s. </p>
      <p><i>La pelle</i> was a surrealistic tale of the degradation of
moral and social values in Naples, where everything is for sale after
the city's liberation by the allied forces. The book caused a scandal
because it was mistaken for a realistic work. Its title referred to
Malaparte's comment that once flags have lost their meaning, people are
only willing to fight for the flag that is their own skin. With this
work, Malaparte became a forerunner of gonzo journalism. "But I'm a
free artist, I don't depend on the simple reality", he once said. </p>
      <p>In 1947 Malaparte settled in Paris and wrote dramas without
much success.
In the country retreat of his Parisian friend at Jouy-en-Josas he wrote
a collection essays and recorded in his diary his thoughts as an
expatriate, published posthumously in 1966 under the title <em>Diario
di uno straniero a Parigi</em>. "During the war, I know that you did
your duty as a free man," says the Italian ambassador Quaroni to the
narrator, who feels that he is not accepted by the French society due
to his past political affiliations. However, Malaparte portrays himself
in several episodes more of an aesthetic connoisseur than a political
journalist and critic of his time. </p>
      <p>Malaparte's dramas did not bring him the success he had hoped
for. <em>Du côté de chez Proust</em>
, which premiered in 1948, was based on the life of <a href="proust.htm">Marcel Proust</a>. Also&nbsp;<em>Das Kapital</em>
(1949), about Karl, went unnoticed. <i>Cristo Proibito</i> (Forbidden
Christ), a film that Malaparte both&nbsp;scripted and directed, got
lukewarm press comments in Italy. One reviewer said&nbsp;it was "inert,
improbable and strangled&nbsp;by the literature."&nbsp;However,
released in the United States in 1953 as <em>Strange Deception,</em>
it was<em> </em>voted among the five best foreign films by National
Board Of Review.<font size="2">&nbsp; </font><font size="3">Starring
Raf Vallone, Rina Morelli and Alain Cuny the film was shot in and
around the Tuscan village of Montepulciano. In the story a war veteran
returns to his village to revenge the death of his brother, shot by the
Germans. "Though&nbsp;this strange mixture of sacred and philosophical
sentiments is continuously asking such questions as "Why must the
innocent always pay?" it rarely offers any constructive answers." (A.
W. in <i>The New York Times</i>, May 27, 1953) The music score
contains a reference the Finnish folk song 'Karjalan kunnailla' (The
Hills of Karelia). </font></p>
      <p>Malaparte&nbsp;also produced the variety show <i>Sexophone</i>
and planned to cross the United States on bicycle. Just before his
death Malaparte completed the treatment of another film, <i>Il
Compagno P</i>. After the establishment of The People's Republic of
China in 1949 Malaparte became interested in the Maoist version of
Communism, but his journey to China was cut short by illness, and he
was flown back to Rome. <span class="st"><em>Io in Russia e in Cina</em></span>,&nbsp;a
journal from the journey, was published posthumously in 1958.
Malaparte's final book, <em>Maledetti toscani</em><strong> </strong>(1956,
      <em>Those Cursed Tuscans</em>), an analysis of Tuscan character
and attack on bourgeois culture, aroused much&nbsp; controversy in
Italy as it was meant to do. Phoebe Adams wrote in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, that on the whole, the book "tells little about Tuscany or
anything else except Malaparte." Malaparte died of lung cancer in Rome
on July 19, 1957. On his deathbed Malaparte converted to Catholicism &#8211;
his last act of rebelliousness or final act of opportunism. His
beautiful house Malaparte left to the Chinese Communist Government. </p>
