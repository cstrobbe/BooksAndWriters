<p>

<font size="2"> </font><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American mystery writer, one of the great names of the genre, who  establish
his name in the pulps. MacDonald created his famous series character Travis
McGee in his forty-fourth novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Deep Blue Good-by</span>
in 1964, and went on to write twenty-one books about the most
"colorful" of all unlicensed private detectives &#8211; each novel in the
McGee series contains a color in the title. The awarded mystery writer
and critic H.R.F. Keating selected MacDonald's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Green Ripper</span> (1979) in 1987 for his list of the one hundred best crime novels. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The twenty-odd McGee books... are, in
fact, perhaps our best example of the crime story as a novel of
feelings. In this it is not unfair to compare MacDonald to Charles
Dickens, although Dickens had of course an infinitely wider range. But
it is Dickens the novelist of feelings, of sentiment, and of
sentimentality, that MacDonald brings to mind."</b> (Keating in </font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font></blockquote>


      <p>John D. MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, the son of
Eugene Andrew MacDonald, a treasurer of the Savage Arms Corporation,
and Marguerite Dann. He received his B.S. degree from Syracuse
University in 1938, and earned a Harvad M.B.A. in 1939. In 1937, he
married Dorothy Mary Prentiss; they had one son. During World War II,
he served in the Office of Strategic Services (1940-46), the forerunner
of the CIA, and in the Burma-China-India theatre. While in service,
MacDonald began write fiction, and sold later all kinds of stories &#8211;
sports, science, adventure, fantasy &#8211; to a number of magazines. His
first story was published in <i>Story</i> magazine, and the first novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Brass Cupcake</span>, came out in 1950. <font size="2">(<b>Note:</b> </font><font size="2">John D. MacDonald is not to be confused with </font><a href="rossmacd.htm"><font size="2">Ross
Macdonald</font></a><font size="2"> who wrote his first Lew Archer novels under the name John MacDonald.
Next four books he issued as John Ross MacDonald dropping finally the John.</font><font size="2">) </font></p>

<p>An example of MacDonald's early tales is 'In a Small Motel' (1955),
in which he shows his skills in composing believable characters.
Everyday details are depicted carefully, but they do not only give a
sense of realism but are just those small things that his characters
find in their own lives suppressive. Mr. Brown has taken a large sum of
money from his employer and hides himself in a small motel. He believes
he's being watched all the time, and without his gun he is helpless.
Three other persons must decide what to do with him and the money.
MacDonald creates suspense from the different moral stands of his
characters. Ginny is a young widow, who alone tries to take care of the
motel and has problems with mortgage payments. Johnny, who runs a gas
station, and Don, a cunning lawyer, are her rivals. Johnny could buy
new cars with the money and Don has business plans. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I - can't ever forget the way he - " </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">"I know. Funny thing. I found out I'm no saint either." </font><br>
<font size="2">"How do you mean that?" </font><br>
<font size="2">"For just a minute there. I don't know. Gun in my hand
and all that dough. Just had a sudden crazy feeling about grabbing it
and running." </font><br>
<font size="2">"You wouldn't have," she said firmly. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'In a Small Motel') </font></blockquote>
<p>Since 1949 MacDonald lived in Florida, where he set most of his
tales. Like Raymond Chandler or Ross MacDonald, he often he used
fiction to comment such moral or social issues as ecological dangers,
racism, political corruption, real estate scams, infidelity, and the
drug culture. Before MacDonald's McGee appeared in the scene of the
mystery ficion, he had already written over 40 books and several
hundred short stories. His publisher pressured him to create a regular
series character when Richard Prather, who wrote highly popular books
for Fawcett, left for another publisher. MacDonald planned to call his
hero Dallas McGee, but the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas
made him to change the name, he picked it from a US Air Force base. </p>
<p>MacDonald used the first-person narrative, but he did not like its
limitations. The author himself called the figure of McGee a "tattered
knight on a spavined steed." Travis McGee is a Korean War veteran and a
200-pound drop-out from conventional society, a former football player,
who has sandy hair and ice-blue eyes. Usually he wins his fistfights
but he don't like brutality. He drives a 1936 Rolls Royce, and lives in
Fort Lauderdale on a houseboat named 'The Busted Flush', after the
poker hand that won it for him. Following the characters in Steinbeck's
pleasure-loving Mexican-Americans in <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935),
McGee has chosen an alternate life style. His best friend and neighbour
is the brilliant, chess-palying retired economist Meyer &#8211; the
relationship has much literary connections to <a href="rexstout.htm">Rex Stout</a>'s heroes Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.<font size="2"> </font>Typically McGee is drawn into a situation through some obligation from his past, or he is helping his friend or a relative. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Cinnamon Skin</span>
(1982) McGee's friend Meyer lends his boat to his niece Norma, and her
new husband Even. The boat explodes and Meyer enlists his friend McGee
to investigate the case.</p>
<p>After spending some time in Mexico,  MacDonald offered readers details based on his experiences in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Damned</span> (1952) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Border Town Girl </span>(1956). Satirical <span style="font-style: italic;">Dress Her in Indigo</span> (1971), set in Oaxaca, Mexico, brought on the stage American hippies and with them the obligatory drug culture. <span style="font-style: italic;">Nightmare in Pink</span>
(1964) already featured an early fictional use of LSD. The story took
McGee in New York. Usually private detectives consume heavily liquor
and smoke only cigarettes. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I think that most of us have a greater
liking for strong and solid people than we have for the whimps of the
world. With the strong people you can tell where you stand. Nobody, of
course, is too strong to ever be broken. And that is McGee's forte,
helping the strong broken ones mend."</b> (in 'John D. MacDonald' by Ed Gorman, from </font><i><font size="2">The Big Book of Noir</font></i><font size="2">, 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p>MacDonald's device to unite his detective series with a color was
perhaps inspired by Lawrence Treat (1908-1998), who named his mystery
novels with alphabets. McGee began his adventures under the color of
deep blue (<i>The Deep Blue Good-by</i>) in 1964,  referring to a mood and of course to Chandler's <i>The Long Goodbye </i>(1953). In the story McGee goes after a thug who has ruined a woman's life. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Girl in the Plain Brown Wrapper</span> (1968) McGee wraps the dead Maureen Pike in brown paper. </p>
<p>MacDonald's science fiction novels include<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Girl, the Gold Watch, and Everything </span>(1962), a romance about time travel, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ballroom of the Skies </span>(1952), a story about an atomic war that leaves India world ruler. <span style="font-style: italic;">Murder in the Wind&nbsp;</span> (1956) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Condominium</span> (1977) were realistic descriptions of hurricanes. The author published also non-fiction. <span style="font-style: italic;">The House Guests</span>
(1965) focused on animals, principally on cats &#8211; they are very proper
sidekicks for lonely private eyes, as Robert Altman proved in his film <i>The Long Goodbye</i> (1973), an updating of Chandler's novel. <span style="font-style: italic;">Deadly Drug</span> (1968) was an account of the hearing and trials of Dr. Carl Coppolino, a doctor accused of killing his wife and a neighbor. <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothing Can Go Wrong&nbsp;</span> (1981) told about the mishaps on the SS <i>Mariposa </i>the MacDonalds experienced on one of their cruises. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Lonely Silver Rain</span>
(1984) was the last in the Travis McGee series. MacDonald never used
the color black &#8211; or white &#8211; in the title, and it was rumored for a
long time that there was a final, 'black' McGee story. MacDonald died
on December 28, 1986. Among his awards were Grand Prix de Littérature
Policiere (1964), Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award (1972),
and American Book Award (1980). The first John D. MacDonald conference
was held in 1978 and subsequent followed in the 1980s and 1990s. </p>
<p>Several of MacDonald's stories have been filmed. J.Lee Thompson's <i>Cape Fear</i> (1962), starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, was based on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Executioners</span> (1958), and remade in 1991.<b> </b>"What
I like about you is you're rock bottom. I wouldn't expect you to
understand this, but it's a great comfort for a girl to know she could
not possibly sink any lower."<font size="2"> (Barrie Chase to Robert Mitchum, playing the psychopath Max Cody) </font>The
plot of the novel revolves around the idea, that to stop an unstoppable
monster, in this case a psychopath rapist, the protagonist must abandon
all idealism and become a monster himself. In the book, Sam Bowen is a
lawyer, who does not believe in vigilantism, but when his family is
constantly harassed by a clever ex-convict, Max Cady, Sam tells his
wife. "I want to commit a murder, and I think I know how it can be
done." At the end, as Cody tries to escape from a trap, he is wouded
fatally by a nearly accidental shot by Sam, who afterwards feels
satisfied. "All the neat and careful layers of civilized instincts and
behavior were peeled back to reveal an intense exultation over the
death of an enemy." </p>
<p><i>Man-Trap </i>(1961), directed by actor Edmond O'Brien, was based on a novelette. <i>Kona Coast</i> (1968) was based on a short story. Travis McGee appeared in <i>Darker Than Amber</i> (1970), directed by Robert Clouse and featuring Rod Taylor as McGee. <i>Travis McGee: The Empty Copper Sea </i>(1982), starring Sam Elliott, was a television film, directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. <i>A Flash of Green</i> (1984) was Victor Nuñez's adaptation of MacDonald's 1962 novel. <span style="font-style: italic;">I Could Go on Singing </span>(1963)
was MacDonald's novelization of a screenplay, written by Mayo Simon.
MacDonald hated the work so much that he bought back the rights of the
book and refused to allow it to be reprinted. The film, directed by
Ronald Neame and starring Judy Garland and Dirk Bogarde, told about an
American star, who is torn between her career and her old lover and
their illegitimate son. </p>
