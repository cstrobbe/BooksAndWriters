<p>

American writer, who gained world fame with his satirical, anti-war novel 
<em>Catch-22</em> (1961), set in the World War II Italy. The book was
partly based on Heller's own experiences and influenced among others
Robert Altman's comedy M*A*S*H, and the subsequent long-running TV
series, set in the Korean War. The phrase "catch-22" has entered the
English language to signify a no-win situation, particularly one
created by a law, regulation or circumstance. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"All over the world, boys on every side
of the bomb line were laying down their lives for what they had been
told was their country, and no one seemed to mind, least of all the
boys who were laying down their young lives. There was no end in
sight." </b>(in</font><i><font size="2"> Catch-22</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>


<p>Joseph Heller war born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of poor Jewish
parents. His Russian-born father, Isaac Daniel Heller, was a bakery
truck driver. He died in 1927 from a botched ulcer operation. The
family &#8211; Heller's mother, Lena, who worked as a seamstress, his
half-sister Sylvia, and his half-brother, Lee &#8211; lived in a small
four-room apartment looking out on West 31st Street near Surf Avenue in
Coney Island. Lena could barely speak English. She liked to read and
Heller brough her from the Coney Island public library Yiddish
translations of novels. Her favorite book was Tolstoy's <em>Anna Karenina</em>, which she read over and over. </p><p>
"Joe was a pain in the neck," o<span class="st">ne of Heller's schoolmates recalled. "He was brighter than all of us. He was a needler, a big mouth." </span>After
graduating from Abraham Lincoln High School in 1941, Heller joined the
Twelfth Air Force. He was stationed in Corsica, where he flew 60 combat
missions as a B-25 bombardier. After his discharge from the army, he
married Shirley Held; they had met in New York's Catskill Mountains <em></em>via a dance contest at Grossinger&#8217;s Resort.</p><p>In 1949 Heller received his M.A. from 
Columbia University. He was a Fulbright scholar at Oxford in 1949-50, and then worked as a teacher at Pennsylvania 
State University (1950-52), copywriter for the magazines <i>Time</i> 
(1952-56), <i>Look</i> (1956-58), and promotion manager for
<i> McCall´s</i>. Heller left <i>McCall's </i>in 1961 to teach 
fiction and dramatic writing at Yale University and the University of 
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>His first stories Heller sold already during his student times. They were published in such magazines as <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and <i>Esquire</i>. <span class="st">The idea for <em>Catch-22</em> came to&nbsp;Heller i</span>n
the early 1950s. At that time&nbsp;he was employed as a copywriter at a
small advertising agency and in the evenings he worked with his book in
the foyer of a West End Avenue apartment. "As I've said and repeat, I
wrote the first chapter in longhand one morning in 1953, hunched over
my desk at the advertising agency (from ideas and words that had leaped
into my mind only the night before); the chapter was published in the
quarterly<i> New World Writing #7</i> in 1955 under the 
title "Catch-18." (I received twenty-five dollars. 
The same issue carried a chapter from Jack Kerouac's <i>On the Road</i>, 
under a 
pseudonym.)"<b></b><b></b><font size="2"> (in </font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"><i>Now 
and Then</i></font><i><font size="2"></font></i><font size="2">, 1998)</font></p><p>Because Leon Uris was preparing to release a war novel entitled <i>Mila 18</i>
(1961) Heller changed his number from 18 to 14 and then to 22 from the
suggestion of his editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, Robert Gottlieb &#8211;
because "it&#8217;s funnier than eighteen." Heller's work went largely
unnoticed until 1962, when its English publication received critical
praise. And in <i>The New York World-Telegram</i> Richard Starnes opened his column with 
the prophetic words: "Yossarian will, I think, live a very long time." An earlier reviewer called the book "repetitious and 
monotonous", and another "dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights." </p>
<p>The protagonist is Captain John Yossarian, lead bombardier of the
256th squadron, who is stationed at an airstrip on the fictitious
island off the coast of Italy during WW II. Other characters include
the conman Milo Minderbinder, company mess officer, who creates a
successful black-market business, Major Major, Lieutenant Scheisskopf,
who wants to turn his men into perfect
parade ground robots, Chief White Halfoat, whose family is constantly
chased and evicted by oil companies, and mail clerk Wintergreen, who is
really running
the war. Jossarian, struggles to retain his sanity and hopes to get a
medical
discharge by pretending to be insane. The story centers on the USAF
regulation which suggests that willingness to fly dangerous combat
missions must be considered insane, but if the airmen seek to be
relieved on grounds of mental reasons, the request proves their sanity.
According to an anecdote, Heller's Finnish translator wrote the author
a letter asking, "Would you please explain me one thing: what means
Catch-22?" </p>
 

<p>Heller's absurd world follows the rules of Samuel Beckett and Lewis
Carroll's Wonderland: "'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're
all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.' 'How do you know I'm mad?' said
Alice. 'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'"
And as Alice, Yossarian eventually rejects the irrational logic of his
rabbit hole after his friends are killed or missing. But instead of
waking up, Yossarian decides to desert to Sweden. The
non-chronological, fragmented narrative underlines the surreal
experience of the characters and the contrast between real life and
illogicalities of war. It has been noted, that Heller's characters have
similarities with Louis Falstein's novel <i>The Sky 
is a Lonely Place</i>,
which was published earlier. Falstein depicts combat missions above
Mediterranean during WW II. However, Heller's tone is comic. The
publication of <i>Catch-22</i> signaled a more experimental approach to the war novel, anticipating such works as Thomas Pynchon's <i>V.</i> (1963) and <a href="vonnegut.htm">Kurt Vonnegut'</a>s <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>
(1969). Heller also expressed the emerging rebelliousness of the
Vietnam generation and criticism of mass society. Members of the rock
band Jefferson Airplane offered him LSD in San Francisco; Heller
replied with a refusal. <br>
 </p>
<p><i>Catch-22</i><i> </i>has enjoyed a steady sale since its
publication. Mike Nichols's movie version of the novel from 1970 is
considered disappointing, although its good cast tried its best.
Nichols emphasized the absurdity of war, and as Heller, he rejected
American militarism. Orson Welles, who also was interested in filming
the book, was in the role of General Dreedle. After writing <i>Catch-22</i>, Heller worked on several Hollywood screenplays, such as <i>Sex and the Single Gir</i><i>l</i>, <i>Casino Royale</i>,<i> </i>
and <i>Dirty Dingus Magee</i>,
and contributed to the TV show "McHale's Navy" under the pseudonym Max
Orange. In the 1960s Heller was involved with the anti-Vietnam war
protest movement. </p>
<p>Heller waited 13 years before publishing his next novel, <em>Something Happened</em>&nbsp;
(1974). It portrayed a corporation man
Bob Slocum, who suffers from insomnia and almost smells the disaster
mounting toward him. Slocum's life is undramatic, but he feels that his
happiness is threatened by unknown forces. "When an ambulance comes,
I'd rather not know for whom," he says in his monologue. Instead of
making him a lovable character, like the rebelliousYossarian,
he is portayed as a heartless, unhappy pessimist, who acts cynically as
a "wolf among a pack of wolves". Vonnegut, Heller's friend, reviewed
the novel for <span style="font-style: italic;">The New York Times</span>.
Heller knew that Vonnegut would not undertake the task unless he would
write favorably about it. Some reviewers were disappointed but Vonnegut
praised the novel as "clear and hard-edged as a cut diamond." <font size="-1">(<span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span>, October 6, 1974)</font><i></i></p>
      <p><em>We Bombed in New Haven</em>&nbsp; (1968), Heller's play-within-a-play, <em></em>was written in part to express his protest against the Vietnam war. 
It was produced on Broadway and ran for 86 performances. <i>Catch-22</i> has also been dramatized. 
Before it was&nbsp;staged at the John Drew Theater in East Hampton, New York, July 13, 1971, a 
group of young actors, who had gone to high school together at Shawnee 
Mission East High School in Prairie Village, Kansas, put on a production in 1964. </p>


<p>Heller's later works include <em>Good as Gold</em> (1979), where
the protagonist Bruce Gold tries to regain the Jewishness he has 
lost. Readers hailed the work as a return to puns and verbal games familiar from Heller's first novel. <em>God Knows</em>
(1984) was a modern version of the story of King David and an allegory
of what it is like for a Jew to survive in a hostile world. David has
decided that he has been given one of the best parts of the Bible. "I
have suicide, regicide, patricide, homicide, fratricide, infanticide,
adultery, incest, hanging, and more decapitations than just Saul's."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font></p>
<p><em>No Laughing Matter</em> (1986), written with 
Speed Vogel, was a surprisingly cheerful account of Heller's experience as a victim of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome. During his recuperation Heller was visited among others by Mario Puzo, Dustin Hoffman and Mel Brooks. <em>Closing Time</em> (1994) is a sequel to 
<i>Catch-22</i>, depicting the current lives of its heroes. Yossarian
is now 40 years older and as preoccupied with death as in the earlier
novel. "Thank God for the atom bomb," says Yossarian. <em>Now and Then</em>
(1998) is Heller's autobiographical work, evocation of his boyhood
home, Brooklyn's Coney Island in the 1920s and 30's. "It has struck me
since&nbsp; &#8211; it couldn't have done so then&nbsp; &#8211; that in <i>Catch-22 </i>and
in all my subsequent novels, and also in my one play, the resolution at
the end of what narrative there is evolves from the death of someone
other than the main character."<font size="2"> (in</font><i><font size="2"> Now and Then</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>
<p>Heller had two children by his first marriage, Erica and Ted. His divorce was recounted in <i>No Laughing Matter</i>. Erica's&nbsp;own book &nbsp;about her father, <em>Yossarian Sleph Here</em>, came out in 2011. The family lived in an apartment at the Apthorp on the Upper West Side.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In
1989 Heller married Valerie Humphries, a nurse he met while ill. Heller
died of a heart attack at his home on Long Island on December 13, 1999.
His last novel,&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man</em></span>
(2000), was about a successful novelist who seeks an inspiration for
his book. "A lifetime of experience had trained him never to toss away
a page he had written, no matter how clumsy, until he had gone over it
again for improvement, or had at least stored it in a folder for
safekeeping or recorded the words on his computer."<b></b><b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"> (in <i>Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man</i>) </font></p>
