<p>German physicits, mathematician, astromoner, and satirical writer,
best-known for his aphorisms he collected in his notebooks (waste
books). Lichtenberg has been admired by such writers and philosophers
as Goethe, Nietzsche, Schopenhaeur, Tolstoy, and Wittgenstein. Goethe
once said: "We may use Lichtenberg&#8217;s writings as the most wonderful
dowsing rod: wherever he makes a joke, there a problem lies hidden." In
his notebooks Lichtenberg examined unsystematically a wide variety of
subjects, from society and philosophical questions to psychology and
art and literature. Throughout his life Lichtenberg suffered from poor
health, but he had hypochondriac tendencies, too. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The greatest things in the world are
brought about other things which we count as nothing: little causes we
overlook but which at length accumulate."</b> (from <i>The Waste Books</i>, translated by </font><font size="2">R. J. Hollingdale) </font></blockquote>
<p>Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was born in Oberramstadt, near
Darmstadt. He was the first of seventeen children, most of whom died at
an early age. From his childhood Lichtenberg suffered from a
malformation of the spine. In spite of becoming a hunchback and the
target of crude and offensive remarks, his writing do not show bitter
attitude toward life. And as much as his own outlook was observed by
other people, he observed their behavior and his own life. His physical
handicap Lichtenberg also could deal with humour. "My head," he said,
"lies at least a foot closer to my heart than is the case with other
men: that is why I am so reasonable." </p>

<p>Lichtenberg's father, Johann Conrad Lichtenberg, was a Lutheran
clergyman. He died in 1751 when Lichtenberg was nine. Henrietta
Catharina (Eckard) Lichtenberg, his mother, came also from a clerical
family; she died in 1764. Later Lichtenberg said, that he had dreams of
his mother every night. In 1763 Lichtenberg entered Göttingen
University, where he studied mathematics and the natural sciences. His
first printed work was 'Von dem Nutzen, den die Mathematik einem Bel
Esprit bringen kann' (1766), which was published in <i>Hannoverische Magazin</i>.
After graduating, he worked as a tutor for three years. During this
period Lichtenberg started to read Kant, but later he was more drawn to
Spinoza&#8217;s way on thinking. </p>

<p>His first sexual encounter Lichtenberg may have experienced in 1766
with Maria Justine Schulzen, a cleaning woman. In 1777 he met Maria
Stechard, a weaver&#8217;s daughter, who was then about thirteen years old.
She started to visit his house daily as a housekeeper and from 1780 she
lived with him permanently. Maria died in 1782. "She reconciled me to
the human race," Lichtenberg recalled, but soon he found another love,
Margarethe Kellner, and again a much younger woman with a working class
background. They lived together from 1786 and were married in 1789.
Margarethe gave him six children and outlived him by 49 years. </p>
<p> Lichtenberg left Göttingen only three times. He visited England
twice &#8211; in 1770 and 1774-1775. These journeys made him an Anglophile;
especially he enjoyed the atmosphere of political freedom. According to
a story, one morning George III once arrived unannounced on his
doorstep, asking in German whether the Herr Professor was at home. A
rumor or joke began to circulate that Lichtenberg was George II&#8217;s
illegitimate son. Lichtenberg's interest in English life and art led
him to write a comprehensive study on Hogarth's engravings,<i> Ausfürliche Erklärung der Hogarthischen Kupfertische</i>, 1794-1835. Lichtenberg produced the first five of 14 instalments. </p>
<p>In 1770 Lichtenberg was appointed assistant professor of physics at
Göttingen and in 1775 he become Professor Ordinarius. He taught
mathematics, physics, astronomy, and a variety of other subjects. As
his fame spread, his lectures on physics started to attract students
from different parts of Europe. At that time it was very common that
physicist were also mathematicians, and passed readily from mechanics
to astronomy. Among his students were the mathematician Carl Friedrich
Gauss (1777-1855), the geographer, naturalist and explorer Alexander
von Humboldt (1769-1859), and the romantic poet <a href="novalis.htm">Novalis</a> (1772-1801). Trying to hide his hump from the curious students, he always came into the lecture room facing his audience. <br>
</p>
      <p>From 1778  Lichtenberg contributed to the <i>Göttinger Taschenkalender</i>, a publication intended to spread the philosophy of the Enlightenment. With G.A. Forster he edited the <i>Göttingisches Magazin der Literatur und Wissenschaft</i> between 1780 and 1782. In 1793 he was elected a member of the Royal Society. </p>


<p>In 1793 Lichtenberg started an affair with his servant girl, Dolly. Probably he recorded in one of his 
notebooks (the K book) intimate details of this  amorous adventure, but most of the book has been destroyed. 
During his last years he drank more than before. One of his neighbors have told, that Lichtenberg woke up late, 
had coffee, bitter, and wine. With lunch he drank wine, and in the afternoon he drank wine and liqueur. And in 
the evenings he read and wrote. Lichtenberg kept on filling up his notebooks until a few days before his death. 
He died at fifty-seven, on February 24, 1799. </p>

<p> Lichtenberg has been credited with introducing the aphorism into
German literature. However, his notebooks in which he wrote his
aphorism for his own amusement, were published posthumously. The names
of the volumes followed the alphabets from A to L, which has several
pages missing. Notebooks G and H have disappeared. </p>
<p>It is possible that Lichtenberg began keeping his notebooks, or
Südelbücher ("waste books") as he called them, while still in school,
but his earliest surviving notes are from the mid-1760s. He also kept a
diary. Lichtenberg's aphorism were first collected in the posthumpus
edition <i>Vermischte Schriften </i>(1800-05). It consisted of nine
volumes. Lichtenberg's style is intimate and direct. Human nature and
its foibles provided much material for his observations. <u> </u>"Soothsayers make a better living in the world than truthsayers," he once said. Lichtenberg ironized the<i> Sturm und Drang</i>
school of writers and admired such English writers as Daniel Defoe and
Henry Fielding. Michel de Montaigne was the only French writer, whom he
read with a pencil in his hand. At that time writers seldom recorded
their dreams, but Lichtenberg showed genuine interest in them. "I know
from endeniable experience that dreams lead to self-knowledge," he
wrote. "Aus den Träumen der Menschen, wenn sie dieselben gnau
anzeigten, ließe sich vielleicht vieles auf ihren Charakter schließen.
Es gehörte aber dazu nicht etwa einer sondern eine ziemliche Menge." <font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> Sudelbuch A</font></i><font size="2">) </font>Later Freud referred to him several times.

</p>
<p>In the spirit of Enlightenment Lichtenberg was an empiricist, who
opposed dogmatism and wanted to substitute knowledge for fancy.
"Superstition," he explained, "originates among ordinary people in the
early and all too zealous instruction they receive in religion: they
hear of mysteries, miracles, deeds of the Devil, and consider it very
probable that things of this sort could occur in everything anywhere."
Lichtenberg questioned accepted truths, but his ironic rationalism was
balanced and cultivated. Goethe&#8217;s theory of color he dismissed. In
geometry he come to the conclusion that Euclid's axioms based on common
sense might not be the only right ones. At the age of sixteen
Lichtenberg lost his Christian faith. In the light of his notebook it
seems that he was not an unshakable atheist. Once he noted: "Never
undertake anything for which you wouldn't have the courage to ask the
blessing of heaven." </p>
<p>Lichtenberg's first important work was <i>Über Physiognomik, wider die Physiognomen</i> (1778), a satire on Johann Caspar Lavater's <i>Physiognomische Fragmente</i>.
Lavater's theory, that people's characters can be read from their
portrait silhouettes, prompted also 'Fragment von Schwänzen', published
in<i> Baldingers Neues Magazin für Aerzte</i> in 1783. Imitating
Lavater's pretentious language, Lichtenberg examined the "expressive"
qualities of tails, tails of dogs and pigs, and "pigtails" of men, all
presented as silhouettes. "What kindliness in the silky tender slope,"
he wrote of an pigtail, "effective without any masking hemp-hiding
ribbon, and yet smiling bliss like plaited sunbeams. Soaring as far
above even crowned heads as saint's halo over a nightcap..." Also the
early satire, <i>Von Konrad Photorin</i> (1773), was directed against Lavater.</p>
