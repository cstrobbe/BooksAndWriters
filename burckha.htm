<p>Swiss historian and art historian, best known for his works on
the Italian Renaissance and on Greek civilization. Burckhardt's famous
thesis in&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Die Kultur der Renaissance in
Italien</em></span> (1860, The Civilization of the Renaissance in
Italy) was that Renaissance first gave the highest development to
individuality. The early signs of "the modern European Spirit" were
according to Burckhardt seen in Florence. Since the publication of his
book, Florence has been regarded as the city where Petrarch's dream of
revival took deepest root. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the Middle Ages both sides of
human consciousness &#8211; that which was turned within as that which was
turned without &#8211; lay dreaming or half-awake beneath a common veil. The
veil was woven of faith, illusion and childish prepossessions, through
which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues. Man was
conscious of himself only as a member of a race, people, party, family
or corporation &#8211; only through some general category. In Italy this veil
first melted into air; an objective treatment and consideration of the
state and all things of this world became possible. The subjective side
at the same time asserted with corresponding emphasis; man became a
spiritual individual and recognized himself as such."</b></font><font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Civilization of the
Renaissance in Italy</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p>Jacob Christoph Burckhardt was born in Basel, the son of a
Protestant minister. His family, active in business, politics, and
scholarly pursuits, was one of the most distinguished in the city &#8211;
eleven ancestors had served its <i>Bürgermeister</i>. Also the family
of Burckhardt's mother, Susanne Maria (née Schorendorf), had lived in
Basel for generations. The death of his mother in 1830 was a terrible
shock for Burckhardt, who at an early age learned how fragile human
life is, but who found in music, art, and poetry the ultimate ground of
all things. Musically gifted, he bound by the age of fifteen his
compositions into a sketchbook, entitled "Composizioni di Giacomo
Burcardo". </p>
<p>Following the wishes of his father, the chief minister of the
state church, Burckhardt started to study theology in 1836 at the
University of Basel, which was regarded as one of the most concervative
theological outposts in Europe. After becoming under the influence of
the German theologian and biblical critic, W.M.L. de Wette, Burckhardt
abandoned these studies, concluding that the birth of Christ is a
myth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1839 Burckhardt&nbsp;entered the University of Berlin,
where he studied history and the history of art under Leopold von Ranke
(1795-1886), whose methods of historical study he adopted. However, he
eventually rejected Ranke's vision of history as an organic, unified
drama, in which God stood behind all phenomena of the past. <span class="st">Instead he tried to find</span> meaning and continuity <i>within</i>
history. Hegel's&nbsp;influence at the university was still
enormous&nbsp;eight years after his death. Both Ranke and
Hegel&nbsp;stressed that the historian should examine his subject in
its own terms. "Each epoch stands immediately before God, and its
values rests not at all on what comes from it but in its own existence,
in its very itself", Ranke said. </p>
<p>During his student years, Burckhardt&nbsp;formed a friendship
with Gottfried Kinkel, a Privatdozent&nbsp;and the future
revolutionary. Through Johanna Matthieux he gained entry to the salon
of Bettina von Arnim, where he sang lieder. Burckhardt&nbsp;may have
met Karl Marx; they both contributed later on articles to <i>Kölnische
Zeitung</i>. As a result of participating in a serenade honoring the
liberal ruler of Baden, Burckhardt himself was listed in the Prussian
police files as a "revolutionary". </p>
<p>Before publishing his first major work, <em>Die Zeit
Constantin's des Grossen</em> (1853, The Age of Constantine the Great),
Burckhardt revised and edited the <i>Handbuch der Geschichte der
Malerei</i> (1847) and the <i>Handbuch der Kunstgeschichte</i> by his
teacher Franz Kugler (1848). In <i>The Age of Constantine the Great</i>,
which examined the transition between late pagan antiquity and the
medieval world, Burckhardt rejected Eusebius' (c.264-340)
portrait of the Byzantine Emperor as a devout Christian hero. Basically
agreeing with the English historian and scholar Edward Gibbon
(1737-1794), Burchardt argued that Constantine was indifferent to
religion and in the last decade of his life the emperor gave
indications of un-Christian, even pagan sympathies. Burckhardt traced
the decline of Rome through the impoverishment of art and the emergence
of early Christian artists, but did not conclude that Christianity bore
the responsibility of the fall of the Roman empire. Burckhardt himself
rejected the concept of a guiding Providence, and according to the poet
Carl Spitteler, one of his students at the Basel <i>Pädagogium</i>, he
often said: "The world is thoroughly evil." </p>
<p>In 1844 Burckhardt edited the conservative <i>Basel Zeitung</i>,
at the same time complaining that the city was extremely boring, and
eventually he resigned from his post. Friedrich Engels once described
Basel as a "barren town, full of frock-coats, cocked hats, philistines
and patricians and Methodists". Bonn and Berlin inspired Burckhardt
more, Basel was still a small, provincial centre, ruled by
centuries-old oligarchy. "I acknowledge the motherly embrace of our
common German fatherland, which I once mocked and rejected like nearly
all my Swiss compatriots," he wrote to a friend. </p>
<p>Between 1846 and 1856 Burckhardt made several long trips to
Italy, partly to escape his feeling of loneliness and narrowness of the
social circles &#8211; "Italy opened my eyes," he summarized his first
impressions. Burckhardt's Italian teacher was Luigi Picchioni, who had
participated in plots to free Lombardy from Austrian rule. Burckhardt
dedicated to Picchioni the second edition of <i>The Civilization of
the Renessaince</i>, though at that time he had already abandoned his
liberal beliefs. Florence was for Burckhardt the "most important
workshop of the Italian, and indeed of the modern European spirit."
Burckhardt was a life-long bachelor, but it seems that he had an
unsuccesfull courtship in the late 1840s. This experience perhaps was
behind his two short volumes of poetry, <em>Ferien. Eine Herbstgabe</em>
(1849) and<em> E Hämpfeli Lieder</em> (1853). </p>
<p>In 1848 Burckhardt taught at the Pädagogium in Basel and in
1855 at the Polytechnic Institute in Zürich, an expanding and
progressive city, which became the center of Swiss liberalism.
Burckhardt was happy in Zürich, but three years later he resigned from
his post. After his father's death in 1858 he destroyed most of their
correspondence.</p>
<p>From 1858 to 1893&nbsp;Burckhardt held chair of history and
art
history at the University of Basel. "Having completed the writings he
had begun in his early years," Burckhardt said in the obituary he wrote
for himself around 1869, "he devoted himself exclusively to his task as
a teacher..." At his late age Burckhardt associated the new
middle-class culture and the <i>Grossstadt </i>with Jews; he lamented
that the metropolis undermined the culture of old Europe he was
committed to, the spirit that formerly existed in small centers of
influence. </p>
<p>One of Burckhardt's students was <a href="../../../wolfflin.htm">Heinrich Wölfflin</a> (1864-1945), who
suceeded him in the chair of art history at the University of Basel and
become an editor of Burckhardt's work. In <i>Renaissance und Barock </i>(1888),
Wölfflin made a clear historical distinction between these two styles.
For Jacob Burckhardt, whose thought deeply influenced Wölfflin, Baroque
meant degeneration and disruption of the classical Renaissance style.
The Greek Civilization fascinated Burckhardt as much as the
Renaissance. </p>
<p>In<em>&nbsp;<span class="st">Griechische Kulturgeschichte</span></em>
(1898-1902)&nbsp;Burckhardt argued that myth is the underlying gived
factor in Greek existence. "It illuminated the whole of the present for
the Greeks, everywhere and until a very late date, as though it
belonged to a quite recent past; and essentially it presented a sublime
reaction of the perceptions and the life of the nation itself." As he
analyzed the worldliness of Renaissance, Burckhardt wrote in <i>The
Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy</i>: "To the study of man,
among many other causes, was due the tolerance and indifference with
which the Mohammedan religion was regarded".</p>
<p>Except the time he spent in Zürich and his short visits to
Italy, Germany, France, and England, Burckhardt lived in his native
town, although it was not until the 1870s, that he felt there really at
home. From Burckhardt's apartment, a few rooms above a bakery, was a
short walk to the university. Though was considered "liberal" and
"rather too much of a freethinker" he was also known affectionately as
Köbi, and even a kind of patron saint of Basel. Carl Jung and other
young students regarded Burckhardt as a part of the atmosphere of the
city and his anti-modernism was not a serious issue &#8211; everybody read
him. </p>
<p>Burckhardt lectured on both history and art history, and later
he even abandoned the purely historical discipline. He also gave a
number of public lectures, which served as a <i>bürgerliche Akademie</i>
(citizens' academy). In 1871, when he was offered to succeed von Ranke
as chair of history, he rejected. Although Burckhardt did not consider
Basel intellectually stimulative, one of his reasons to stay there was
his deep rooted local patriotism &#8211; he felt that as a Basler at the
university he was "bound by sense of honor and duty." </p>
<p>At the university Burckhardt was Nietzsche's elder colleague
and the philosopher attended some of Burckhardt's lectures. They had
also some long conversations. Burckhardt had brought the inner tensions
of Greek culture to his attention and later&nbsp;Nietzsche introduced
the concepts of Apollonian and Dionysian in<em> The Birth of Tragedy </em>(1872).&nbsp;When
Nietzsche sent him a copy of his collected essays, <em>Unzeitgemässe
Betrachtungen</em> (1874), Burckhardt wrtote to him: "In the first
place my poor head has never been capable of reflecting, at a distance,
as you are able to do, upon final causes, the aims and the desirability
of history." </p>
<p>As personalities, they were opposites &#8211; Burckhardt was
outwardly more calm and reserved than Nietzsche, but they both were
free from religious prejudices of the time. Some of their ideas, such
as the interpretation of classical Greek culture, had similarities.
Nietzsche first admired greatly Wagner but then turned his back to him.
Burckhardt always disliked the composer. In his last works, Nietzsche
paid his respects to the old professor. Just before he become insane,
he sent a letter to Burckhardt, saying&nbsp;that he would rather have
been a Swiss professor than God. Always reserved, Burckhardt forwarded
the letter to Franz Overbeck, another friend of Nietzsche. </p>
<p>Burckhardt died in Basle on August 8, 1897. On his deathbed,
he gave permission to print his historical-philosophical lecture notes.
Werner Kägi, Burckhardt's successor in the chair of history, edited his
letters. Among Burckhardt's friends was the writer <a href="vonheyse.htm">Paul von Heyse</a>; their correspondence was
published in 1974. Heyse received the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1910, the first German to be so honored. </p>
<p>According to Burckhardt, the political organization was based
in Italy on the city-state rather than feudalism, and "in the character
of these States, whether republics or despotisms, lies, not the only,
but the chief reason for the early development of the Italian." There
in the city-states the modern political spirit of Europe emerged first,
"surrendered freely to its own instincts. Often displaying the worst
features of an unbridled egotism, outraging every right, and killing
every germ of a healthier culture. But, wherever this vicious tendency
is overcome or in any way compensated, a new fact appears in history &#8211;
the State as the outcome of reflection and calculation, the State as a
work of art." This was a precondition to what Burckhardt and
Michelangelo called "the discovery both of the world and of man".
Pre-Renaissance times biographies did not have a real sense for
individuality, inward and outward characteristics of the person they
described. Renaissance man was a "spiritual individual and recognized
himself as such." This was also one of Burckhardt's starting points in
his criticism of the decline of modern culture and its values. Another
was the French Revolution. In 1868 he opened a lecture, saying: "In the
two months since our course began, militarism has so increased, the
economic struggle entered into such a terrible crisis, that we have the
right once again to look back at where the shaking began. We may thus
once again examine the course of the French Revolution." Burckhardt's
thoughts of the loss of individualism influenced among others the
Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955), who called him a
master of extra-philosophical view of history. </p>
<p>The Condottiere, the leader of a band of mercenaries, was the
early embodiment of the era of unscrupulous brutes. According to
Burckhardt, condottieres were "full of contempt for all sacred things,
cruel and treacher", but at the same time "the genius and capacity of
many among them attained the highest conceivable development".
Burckhardt's portrayal anticipated Nietzsche's 'overman' (superman),
who realizes his own unique individuality.<b> </b>"Are you the
victorious one, the self-conqueror, the commander of your senses?"
Nietzsche asked in <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> (1883). </p>
<p>Burckhardt emphasized the individual person as the starting
point of historical study. "It is not hard for firmly united, clever,
and courageous men to do great things in the world," he wrote in <i>Judgments
on History and Historians</i> (1929). "Ten such men affect 100,000."
Great personalities can give a direction to whole epochs, and determine
the course of history. At the same time he saw pessimistically that
like the organic nature, cultures spring into being, mature, and
decline. </p>
<p>Burckhardt's distrust of historical progress was not in tune
with the generally optimistic cultural-historical writing of the time.
Later Oswald Spengler gave to the cyclic view of cultural epochs its
most visionary expression in his famous work, <i>The Decline of the
West</i> (1918-1922). Spengler did not see any divine plan behind
history. Burckhard accepted the concept of a universal spirit expressed
in culture. He believed that the process of growth and decay follow
laws, which are basically beyond human understanding. Burckhardt
rejected G.W.F. Hegel's (1770-1831) theory, in which history expresses
the realization of Absolute Spirit, its coming to self-consciousness
about itself. </p>
