<P>Danish journalist, writer, and explorer, who established with Knud Rasmussen (1879-1933) the exploring station in Thule (1910). In addition to Arctic journeys, Freuchen also visited South Africa in 1935. Freuchen has confessed in his book of memoirs, <EM>Min gr&oslash;nlandske ungdom</EM> (1936), that he never planned to become an Arctic explorer, although he had from childhood wanted to go to sea. As a writer-adventurer he belonged to the company of such great names as <A href="hstanley.htm">Henry Morton Stanley</A>, <A href="telawren.htm">T.E. Lawrence</A>, and Thor Heyerdahl. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"Nomads are always on the move not because restlessness is their nature, but because living conditions drive them from place to place. The Arctic Eskimo must catch seals for meat and kamik skins and other things he needs. He must get walrus tusks in order to have flensing knives and harpoon points. He finds foxes at the mountains where the birds are too numerous to count. He goes north and he goes south. Thus it has been for so long that he no longer knows why he is moving."</B> (from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Vagrant Viking</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1954) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Peter Freuchen was born in Nyk&oslash;bing, on the island of Falster, the son of&nbsp; Lorentz Benzon Freuchen,&nbsp;a Danish Jew 
businessman, and Anne Petrine Frederikke Rasmussen. Already at the age of eight Freuchen had his own small boat.&nbsp;Most his free time sailing Freuchen spent sailing&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> the somber Cathedral School and classical education in Latin did not much interest him, but he&nbsp;felt more comfortable&nbsp;in the company of sailors at the local harbor, listening to their stories from distant countries. </P><P>For a time,&nbsp;Freuchen studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen, without regarding the medical profession&nbsp;as his&nbsp;his true calling.&nbsp;In 1906, Freuchen&nbsp; took a job as a stoker on a steamer and ended up in Greenland, where made his first expedition. From 1910 to 1924 he&nbsp;took part in several expeditions, often traveling with the famous Polar explorer Knut Rasmussen. Freuchen learned to relish blue green seagull eggs and year old whale blubber. On a journey accross the inland ice in 1912 he was almost killed. These experiences Freuchen recorded in <I>Vagrant Viking</I> (1953) and<I> I Sailed with Rasmussen</I> (1958).</P>
<P>After returning to Denmark from the first journey,&nbsp;Freuchen wrote articles for the newspaper <I>Kristeligt Dagblad</I>, 
published serial stories in the magazine <I>Familie-Journalen</I>, and eventually received his M.A. from the university. 
With Knut Rasmussen he did lecture tours and worked as a reporter for the liberal newspaper <I>Politiken</I>.&nbsp;While in&nbsp;1910 in 
Greenland he collected articles for Danish museums and in 1913-20 he served as a governor of the colony at Thule. During 
these years he lived with the Inuits (or Eskimos as he writes), and shared their way of life. Freuchen's opinion of 
Christian missionaries was negative <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> he saw them trampling on the traditions of the Inuit 
people, without understanding them. </P><P>In 1911 Freuchen married Mekupaluk, an Inuit woman, who started to use the name Navarana. They had a son and a daughter. She followed him on some of his later explorations. With Navarana he visited Copenhagen, too; she was eager to see Freuchen's home land, but she found it difficult to understand why any woman would live in Denmark <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> there are no seals or walruses and everybody must buy their food from a shop. However, she was especially enthusiastic about ballet. Navarana died in 1921 during an influenza epidemic&nbsp;and was
&nbsp;buried in Upernavik's old churchyard. Because Navarana was not baptized – she wore both a crucifix and 
an old amulet, a ball of a piece of drift timber – the local church refused to 
participate in the burial and Freuchen himself undertook it. Eventually Freuchen settled down in Denmark, and bought 
himself a little island, Enhoje. In 1924 he married Magdalene Lauridsen, a margarine heiress; the marriage dissolved in 1944. <EM>Gr&oslash;nland, land og folk</EM>, his first book, appeared in 1927. <EM>Storfanger</EM>, Freuchen's first novel,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in the same year. </P>

<P>In 1926 Freuchen got frostbite in his leg.&nbsp;He first amputated his own gangrenous toes with shears and a hammer. The leg was operated&nbsp;by a doctor in Hudson Bay. Though&nbsp;Freuchen could not continue his full-time career as an explorer, he still continued journeying. Providing his stories with fascinating details, Freuchen claimed to have witnessed polar bears' covering their black noses with their paws while hunting their prey. </P><P>Freuchen was again in Greenland in 1932 <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> this time he was hired by American Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios at $300 a week to assist in the film production of his book,<EM> Eskimo</EM>. Six feet seven inches tall,&nbsp;with a bushy beard, and a peg leg, Freuchen was an imposing figure, and also played a major role in the film, which depicted the life of an Inuit hunter and his family. Freuchen himself played&nbsp;the villain. In Hollywood, he became friends with Jean Harlow and Mae West. At the Berlin premier of the film, he lifted Hitler's favorite cinematographer Leni Riefenstahl playfully over his head. </P><P>Freauchen portayed the conflict between different cultures with understanding and humour. His novel <EM>Ivalu</EM> (1930, Ivalu, the Eskimo Wife) was a tribute to Navarana. Ivalu is an Inuit girl, who hears stories of white men, and knows that they have a great lust for women. She meets Karl Boesen, called Bosi. After the death of Ivalu's husband, Mitserk, her new man Minik treats her badly. Eventually Bosi takes her as his wife.&nbsp;<EM>Nordkaper</EM> (1929) tells a story of a polar whaling voyage and&nbsp;<EM>Hvid mand</EM> (1943) is a historical novel based on life in the Danish colony in Greenland in the early 1700s.</P>
<P>After settling in Denmark in the 1920s, Freuchen joined the Social democrats and contributed to the newspaper <I>Politiken</I>. He also headed a film company, bought an island farm near Copenhagen, which he later turned into a refugee station, and served as president of boxer's union in Denmark. Upon the invitation of Russians, Freuchen went to Siberia, and wrote about his experiences in&nbsp;<EM>Sibiriske eventy</EM> (1939). On the way home his train rammed head into another in collision that demolished the locomotion and the four cars ahead of his. </P><P>An outspoken anti-Nazi, Freuchen proposed a ban against Danish athletes taking part in the Olympic Games in Berlin. His speech about German concentration camps was noted by a cultural propagandist, who declared that there was not a single concentration camp in the country.As a resuelt of Freuchen's&nbsp;stand, his&nbsp;books were banned and he was declared a&nbsp;"Jiidisher <BR>Schweinehund."&nbsp;</P><P>During World War II, Freuchen worked for the Danish underground. Though&nbsp;he was captured by the Germans occupying his country and sentenced to death,&nbsp;Freuchen&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;flee, by climbing over a barbed-wire fence. With the help of his friends, he was&nbsp;smuggled&nbsp;to Sweden in a fishing boat. After moving&nbsp;to the United States, Freuchen lived&nbsp;mostly in New York City, maintaining also&nbsp;a country home in Connecticut. His third wife, Dagmar Cohn, was a fashion illustrator.&nbsp;Freuchen was a member of the council of the Royal Danish Geographical Society and a fellow of the American Geographical Society. </P><P>Among Freuchen's later, highly popular works was <I>Book of the Seven Seas</I> (1957).&nbsp;In <EM>Fangsm&aelig;nd i Melville-bugten</EM> (1956) Freuchen described his family life, his hunting on whaling ships 
on the sea or hunting seals and polar bears on the coast. Freuchen also recorded stories which his&nbsp;Inuit 
 friends told about their own adventures. White fishermen, explorers and trappers, who learned the hard way how to survive in 
the arctic surroundings, were a constant source of anecdotes for the natives. </P><P>In 1955,&nbsp;Freuchen returned for the last time to Thule, where at that time houses and paved streets had replaced the igloos and snow paths. Freuchen's son Mequsaq, half Inuit, who could not endure European life,&nbsp;went back to Greenland; Pipaluk, his daughter was educated in Denmark. Freuchen died of a heart attack in Alaska, Elmendorf, on September 2, 1957, while carrying a heavy baggage up a loading ramp.</P>
