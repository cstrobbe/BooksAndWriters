<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English writer,&nbsp;whose light
and witty novels became hugely popular and were translated into several
languages, including Finnish and Swedish. Monica Dickens, the
great-granddaughter of <a href="dickens.htm">Charles Dickens</a>,&nbsp;gained
first fame with books based on her own on experiences in working life.
In 1970 she started to write the popular <i>Follyfoot </i>series for
children.&nbsp; "I want to entertain, to tell the truth, to try to help
people understand other people," she once said. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'I've been abroad. Egypt, South
America, India. I've seen how they treat horses. But this poor
fellow... I can't take him, so I thought of you. When I couldn't get an
answer on the phone, I pushed him into the truck and brought him over.
I know there is always room here for a horse in trouble.'"</b> (in <i>Dora
at Follyfoot</i>, 1972) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Monica Dickens was born in London. Her father was Henry
Charles Dickens, a barrister-at-law; he was the son of Sir Henry
Fielding Dickens, a judge, Charles Dickens' eighth child. Fanny (née
Runge), her mother, was of German origin. Because of her rebellious
spirit Dickens was expelled from a private girls' school in London: she
wouldn't wear the school uniform.&nbsp;  </p>
      <p>After studies at St. Paul's School for Girls, she traveled abroad. Dickens continued her studies at a theatre school, from
where she was kicked out "for not being able to act." She then worked as
a journalist, contributing to the magazine <i>Woman's Own</i> for
twenty years. Dickens started her career as novelist with several
autobiographical works. <br>
</p>
      <p>Shocking her family, Dickens abandoned high society and took manual jobs. Her first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">One Pair of Hands</span> (1939), she wrote
in three weeks. It was based on her experiences as a cook and general
servant. With humor and pointed commentary, Dickens portrayed the
delicate and ongoing war between the wealthy and their servants. Also
autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">Mariana</span>
(1940) was a story of a young woman, whose husband is at war, and who
looks back over her past. The <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> described the
book as "funny, poignant and a perfect period piece." </p>

      <p>During World War II Monica Dickens worked in an aircraft
factory repairing Spitfire fighters. <span style="font-style: italic;">One
Pair of Feet</span>
(1942) was an account of her
learning to be a hospital nurse during the war. The book concludes with
Dickens's announcement that she will leave nursing to go and make
tanks. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Happy Prisoner</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> (1946), which was made into a
play by John McNair, dealt with the relationship between a nurse, Elizabeth, and
Oliver, a former officer who lost his leg in Arnheim in a battle and
has a serious heart trouble. Oliver lives with his mother. Other
members of the family include his sisters Violet and Heather with her
son David. From the small details of their everyday life Dickens draws
an optimistic picture of post-war England. Her experiences as a
reporter on a local newspaper were recorded in the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">My Turn to Make the Tea&nbsp;</span>
(1951).</p>
      <p>After marrying Roy Stratton, an US-Marine officer who wrote
two detective novels, Dickens moved in 1951 to the United States. When
her husband retired from the navy in 1953, she moved with him to Cape
Cod, Massachusetts. They also had a flat in Kensington, London. Dickens
continued
to incorporate first-hand experiences into her novels with <span style="font-style: italic;">No More Meadows</span> (1953) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Kate and Emma</span> (1964), which arouse
directly from her involvement with the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. </p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Room Upstairs</span>
(1964) depicted the life of an old woman, Sybil, who becomes the prey
of vacillating loyalties and bewilderments of modern society. A
six-line highway slices through her farm, leaving a farmhouse on the
other side and the barn on the other. Sybil, a widow of eighty,
fractures her thigh after the wedding of her grandson. Dorothy Grue, a
housekeeper, is hired to look after Sybil. Dorothy starts to rule the
house and keeps Sybil under control by every possible means. But when
Dorothy becomes interested in the herb recipes written down by Sybil's
father, she will finally taste her own medicine. </p>
      <p>Dickens worked with a number of charitable organizations and
founded the first American branch of Samaritans (the suicide prevention organization) in Massachusetts in
1974. One of her projects was the erection of suicide barriers on the Bourne and Sagamore bridges across the Cape Cod canal. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cobbler's Dread </span>(1963)
emerged from her work with the RSPA and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Listeners</span>
(1970) from work with
Samaritans. Around the human tragedy Dickens builds a story of human
crisis, depicting the various
persons, with all sorts of backgrounds, working for the organization.
The central characters include Tim Shaw, a lonely young man who is
unemployed, Andrew, an university student, Paul, a teacher, who can
save a man who has swallowed too many sleeping pills, Sarah, a childish
young wife, and Victoria, a journalist. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'But at the last moment, because
you are a human being and self-preservation is your second strongest
instinct, sometimes at the last moment, you send out one more cry for
help.' He laid his hand on one of the telephones on the desk. 'And it
is answered. At the last moment, because you can't bear to go unnoticed
into your final act, you ask someone to listen to you. And they
listen.'"</b> (in <i>The Listeners</i>, 1970) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Dickens's 'Follyfoot' juvenile books, which centered on tales
of horses and farming communities, were based on the Yorkshire
Television series, which ran from 1971-1973. Dickens's lifetime
experience of riding and knowledge of everything to do with horses
pervade these books, which depict people who live at Follyfoot, a
Home of Rest for Horses, and their attempts to right injustices done to horses. The enemy of
Follyfoot is Sidney Hammond, whose own riding stables will not bear
inspection and whose loutish son makes Callie's life at school a
misery. Carrie Fielding, a horse-mad dreamer, was the heroine in the
World's End series, <span style="font-style: italic;">The House at the
World's End</span> (1970), <span style="font-style: italic;">Summer at
the World's End</span> (1971), <span style="font-style: italic;">World's
End in Winter </span>(1972), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Spring
Comes to World's End </span>(1973). Carrie lived in an old in and
rescued and cared for ill-treated animals.</p>
      <p>Dickens's autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">An Open
Book</span>, came out&nbsp;in 1978. She lived in Cape Cod until the death of her husband in
1985. After selling the house in North Falmouth, she returned to England, settling in Brightwalton, Berkshire.
Her later works include<span style="font-style: italic;"> Closed
at Dusk&nbsp;</span> (1990), a story of revenge, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Scarred&nbsp;</span>
(1991), about a man who believes that plastic surgery can solve all of his problems. In late 1990 Dickens fell ill with cancer of the colon. Her final novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">One of the Family</span>, which appeared posthumously in 1993. Dickens died on December 25, 1992, at the age of 77, at a
hospital in Reading, England. </p>
