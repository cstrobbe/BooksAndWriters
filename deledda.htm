<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Italian novelist and short story
writer, who was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1926. Grazia Deledda spent her childhood in a
small isolated village, where the people spoke Logudorese, a dialect
closely related to Latin. Her stories are usually set in Sardinia and
depict the life and customs of simple folk &#8211; small landowners,
servants, farmers, and shepherds. Often they must find their own
solutions to complex moral problems. From 1900 until her death in 1936
Deledda resided in Rome. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">The
moon rose before him, and evening voices told him the day had ended: a
cuckoo's rhytmical cry, the early crikets' chirping, a bird calling;
the reeds sighing and the ever more distant voice of the river; but
most of all a breathing, a mysterious panting that seemed to come from
the earth itself. Yes, man's working day was done, but the fantastic
life of elves, fairies, wandering spirits was beginning."</font></b><font size="2"> (in<font size="3"> </font></font><font size="2"><em>Reeds
in the Wind</em>, 1913)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Grazia Cosima Deledda was born in the Sardinian village of
Nuoro into a middle-class family. Her her father,&nbsp;&nbsp;Giovanni
Antonio Deledda, was a prosperous landowner, who served as a mayor of
Nuoro for some time. Francesca Cambosu, Deledda's mother, was not his
first choice for a wife. She spoke only Sardinian and didn't read,
write or speak Italian. Until the age of ten, Deledda attended the
local elementary school, where she shared a desk with a doctor's
daughter. She became her close friend.&nbsp;Five years of
school&nbsp;was her only formal education, before she was privately
tutored in French and Italian. Deledda's father died in 1892, her older
sister died in 1896 following an abortion. </p>
      <p>Deledda was an avid reader of Russian novelists, Cadrucci,
D'Annunzio, and Giovanni Verga, but her reading was unsystematic. At
the age of&nbsp;eight she began to compose poems. She also absorbed
stories from servants, farmhands, and shepherds. When Deledda was
fifteen, her stories, 'Sangue Sardo'&nbsp; (signicicantly entitled
'Sardinian Blood') and 'Remigia Helder', appeared in<em>&nbsp;L'Ultima
moda</em>, a fashion magazine<l'ultima i="" modas="">&lt;&gt;. The
subject of 'Sangue Sardo', a love triangle, was considered by many to
be inappropriate in her home village. However, Deledda continued to
contribute in 1888-89 to magazines published in Rome and Milan. At the
same time she took care of the household responsibilities. Her older
brother had become the head of the family, but he had started to drink
and dissipated the inheritance. "An ugly, horrendous vice, getting
drunk!" Deledda wrote. "At first, I remember, Andrea didn't have this
vice, but for a year now he has raised his elbow at least every fifteen
days." </l'ultima></p>
      <p>Deledda made her debut as a novelist with&nbsp;<em>Stella
d'Oriente</em>&nbsp;(1891) under the pseudonym Ilia di Saint Ismail,
but it was <em>Anime oneste</em> (1895), a family romance for young
women, which secured her fame. Deledda's early works reflected the
influence of folklore. In <em>Tradizioni popolari di Nuoro in Sardegna</em>&nbsp;
(1894-95), an ethnographuc study which appeared in the periodical <em>Rivista
delle tradizioni popolari italiane</em>,&nbsp;she examined the customs
of the village, where she was born. Deledda's interest in the lives of
ordinary men and women and rural customs connected her to Giovanni
Verga (1840-1922), who depicted provincial Sicilian people, and whose
style infuenced deeply a number of prose writers. The stark landscape
has more symbolic value in&nbsp;Deledda's later novels.&nbsp;Her work
has been seen to fall between <i>verismo</i>, a 19th-century Italian
literary movement related to naturalism, and <i>decadentismo</i>,
which emphasized instincts and irrational forces; love, sin, guilt, and
death are the central elements of Deledda's stories. </p>
      <p>In the 1890s, Deledda had three love affairs by mail,
beginning from Stanis Manca, the drama critic for <em>La Tribuna</em>,&nbsp;who&nbsp;interviewed
her for an article published&nbsp;in <em>Vita sarda</em>. He was
followed by Andrea Pirotta, a teacher, and Giovanni De Nava, a poet and
journalist. Deledda left Nuoro in 1899 and&nbsp;went to Cagliari, the
capital of Sardinia. There she met&nbsp; Palmiro Madesani, whom she
married in 1900; they had two sons, Franz and Sardus. Madesani worked
as a civil servant in the Ministero della Finanze. With her
husband,&nbsp;Deledda moved to Rome, but Sardinia remained always for
her the most important source for inspiration. She kept contact to her
native region and made there frequent visits. For the remainder of her
life, Deledda wrote novels at the rate about one a year, producing some
40 works. However, in 1916, the year when her mother died, her only
publications were reprintings of her older works. </p>
      <p>Deledda also translated Balzac's <i>Eugénie Grandet</i> into
Italian in 1930. Benito Mussolini claimed being a great admirer of
Deledda's work, but fascist reign did not leave much traces on her
writing &#8211; in Rome she lived a rather restricted life, occupied by her
writing and domestic matters. Her only travel abroad she made in 1927,
to Stockholm,
when she attended the Nobel Prize ceremonies. Deledda died in Rome on
August 15, 1936</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">In
Grazia Deledda's novels more than in most other novels, man and nature
form a single unity. One might almost say that the men are plants which
germinate in the Sardinian soil itself. The majority of them are simple
peasants with primitive sensibilities and modes of thought, but with
something in them of the grandeur of the Sardinian natural setting.
Some of them almost attain the stature of the monumental figures of the
Old Testament."</font></b><font size="2"> (in the </font><a href="http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1926/press.html"><font size="2">Nobel presentation</font></a> <font size="2">by Henrik
Schück)</font></blockquote>
      <p><em>Il vecchio della montagna</em> (1900, The Old man of the
Mountain) was the first of the author's many books dealing with simple
characters and illustrated the destructive and tragic effects of
overpowering sexual attractions. <em>Dopo il diverzio</em> (1902,
After the Divorce) was a moral story a man, Constantino, who is
condemned to a long prison term for a murder, and his wife, Giovanna,
who finally decides to divorce him. However, Constantino is freed after
a deathbed confession by the actual murderer. </p>
      <p>Deladda's other major works include<em> Elias Portolu</em>
(1903), which depicted a shepherd, who prepares to enter the priesthood
because he falls in love with his brother's fiancée. His brother dies
and he must resolve the conflict between his love and demands of
society. <em>Cenere</em> (1904) told about a story of a young girl who
sacrifices herself for her illegitimate child, killing herself in order
not to harm his son's prospects in life. In this as in other stories
Deledda's protagonist is a woman and a victim, who must eventually
sacrifice herself. The tale was adapted into screen starring Eleonora
Duse, the only film she made. The first proceeds of the film, released
during the final years of WWI, went to the Red Cross. </p>
      <p>Deledda was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature mainly for <em>La
madre </em>(1920), a tragedy set in an isolated Sardinian village.
It&nbsp;tells of a poor woman, who has made many sacrifices so that her
son, Paolo, would become a priest. Paolo is torn between love and
clerical celibacy. At the end she dies in a church during the service
while her son looks on from the altar. The work was translated into
English as <em>The Woman and the Priest</em>&nbsp;with an introduction
by D.H. Lawrence. </p>
      <p>Deledda's later novels have a wider setting than the harshly
beautiful Sardinia but continue to deal with moral and ethical themes,
among them&nbsp;<em>La chiesa della solitudine</em> (1936), which dealt
with the subject of breast cancer. Her last novel was published
posthumously in 1937. Entitled by her editor, Antonio Baldini, <em>Cosima,
quasi Grazia</em>,&nbsp;it was also Deledda's fictionalized
autobiography &#8211; Cosima was her second name &#8211; in which she chronicled
the difficulties faced by a woman who wants to be a writer. </p>
      <p>Deledda received new attention in 1971-1972 at a symposium
marking the hundredth anniversary of her birth.&nbsp;New translations
of her&nbsp;books are also available.&nbsp;Though Deledda's Christian
and archaic world view has made her work somewhat outmodish, her
unpretentious manner of writing creates still powerful impact.
Her&nbsp;characters, many of them society's outcasts,&nbsp;are driven
by&nbsp;their desires and sinful passions, and their face terrible
fates when they challenge&nbsp;community values. <span class="st">The
desire for money is spiritually dangerous</span>. Aparently her own
favorite piece of work was <em>Canne al vento</em> (1913), which told
the story of a aristocratic Pintor family, sliding deep in poverty.
Efix, the family servant, is the personification of loyalty, but she
hides a secret: she has killed the father the three sisters, and tries
to protect them. </p>
