<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->South African writer, founder and president
of the Liberal Party (1953-68), which opposed apartheid and offered a
non-racial alternative to government policy. The party was banned in
1968 by the Prohibition of Political Interference Bill, and Alan Paton
was harassed by the racist government. On the other hand Paton's gentle
Christian-liberal solution to the problems of South Africa was
considered hopelessly inadequate by anti-apartheid activists. Also his
friendship with the conservative Zulu leader Buthulezi, and his
opposition to international sanctions, were criticized. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"And if I write it down, people may know
that he was two men, and that one was brave and gentle; and they may
know, when they judge and condemn, that this one struggled with himself
in darkness and alone, calling on his God and on the Lord Jesus Christ
to have mercy on him. Therefore when the other Pieter van Vlaanderen
did not entreat, this one entreated; and when the other did not repent,
this one repented; and because there is no such magic, this one, the
brave and gentle, was destroyed with him."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Too Late Phalarope</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Alan Stewart Paton was born in Pietermaritzburg (now the province of
Kwa-Zulu-Natal), the son of James Paton, a civil servant, and Eunice
Warder Paton. From his early childhood Paton witnessed the increase of
white power at the expense of the rights of the black majority. Neither
of his parents was highly educated. His father used to beat his sons,
and it was this traumatic experience which later shaped his views on
corporal punishment. Paton found the magic of literature at an early
age, reading such writers as Walter Scott, Charles Dickens and Rupert
Brooke. His parents' Christian faith and the prose of the King James
Version of the Bible deeply influenced the themes of sound of his
writings. Later, in the first volume of his autobiography, Paton
described how the vision of John of Patmos, "of that world where there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying" filled his
imagination. </p>
<p>Paton was educated at Maritzburg College and Natal University
College. Both were white-only institutions. His first poem, 'To a
Picture,' was published at the university's magazine in 1920. After
graduating with a degree in physics, Paton worked as a teacher at the
Ixopo High School for White Students and then at a high school in
Pietermaritzburg. In Ixopo Paton fell in love with Dorrie Francis
Lusted. Soon after she was widowed, Paton married her in 1928 and
converted to Anglicalism; he was born a Methodist. Dorrie Francis died
in 1967 of emphysema. His years with her Paton recorded in <span style="font-style: italic;">Kontakio For You Departed</span> (1969; also: For You Departed). In 1969 Paton married his secretary, Anne Hopkins. </p>
<p>As the protége of the liberal politician Jan Henrik Hofmeyer, Paton
was appointed in 1935 Principal of the Diepkloof Reformatory for young
offenders. He held the post for thirteen years, and introduced
controversial progressive reforms, which were undone after his
resignment. However, this period was crucial for the formation of his
political consciousness. In the mid-1940s Paton went on a tour of
prisons and reformatories in Sweden, Norway, and in North America.
Paton began writing his first and best known novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cry, The Beloved Country</span>
(1948) in 1946 in Trondheim, Norway, and finished the book in San
Francisco on Christmas Eve, the same year. Since its publication, the
assessment of Paton's novel has to some extent varied according to the
unfolding political situation.</p>
<p>The story depicted the collective guilt and friendship across racial
prejudices in the story of a black South African. Stephen Kumalo, an
ageing Zulu minister, travels from his tribal village to Johannesburg,
where he finds that his only son, Absalom, has murdered the only son of
a white man, James Jarvis. Absalom is hanged but the tragedy connects
these two men, and later they begin to work together. Paton's novel was
inflenced by <a href="laurens.htm">Laurens van der Post</a>'s less commercially successful <i>In a Province</i>
(1934), but its story of a young man corrupted by a big city has been
told by a number of writers all over the world. In South Africa the
theme was called "Jim goes to J'burg". </p>
<p>When the book appeared, it was regarded by many white South Africans
as either sentimental or almost revolutionary in the ideological
atmosphere of the country. At the general election in 1948, the
separatist National Party had come to power and Paton and other
liberals were thrust into opposition. In the decades of open militancy
from the 1970s, Paton's political views and biblical resonances were
doubted by those black readers who were involved in the political
struggle. Other than in South Africa the novel has always been more
widely appreciated in the United States than elsewhere. Moreover, the
linguistic errors in the translation from the Zulu language raised
criticism.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"<i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i>,
however, is also a monument to the future. One of South Africa's
leading humanists, Alan Paton, vividly captured his eloquent faith in
the essential goodness of people in his epic work." </b>(Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa.) </font></blockquote>
<p>Paton's next international success was <span style="font-style: italic;">Too Late the Phalarope</span>
(1953), which explored racial and political inflexibility. Its opening
lines echo the gloominess of a Greek tragedy: "Perhaps I could have
saved him, with only a word, two words, out of my mouth. Perhaps I
could have save us all. But I never spoke them." The protagonist is a
white policeman, Pieter van Vlaanderen, who enters into an exploitative
liaison with a young black girl, Stephanie. The story is partly
narrated by Peter's aunt in rhetorical language: "But you must not
think I judge, nor must you think I write as a child and ignorant. For
I know there is time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a
time to dance; a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones
together; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing."
Their fate reflects the effects of the National Party's obsession with
racial purity &#8211; the South African Immorality Act explicitly prohibited
sexual relations between the races. </p>
<p>Paton's short stories, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tales from a Troubled Land</span> (1961), and his third novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ah, but Your Land is Beautiful</span>
(1981), also dealt with the racial theme. The novel was built on
parallel life stories, letters, speeches, news and records in legal
proceedings, and mixed fictional and real-life characters, such as
Albert Lutuli and Henrik Vervoerd. "Paton attempts to imbue his
characters with a humanity not expected of them. In this novel, for
example, we meet the supposedly obdurate Afrikaner who contravenes the
infamous Immorality Act... There are other Afrikaners, too, who are led
by their consciences and not by rules, and regulations promulgated by a
faceless, monolithic parliament." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Post-Colonial African Writers</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Pushipa Naidu Parekh and Siga Fatima Jagne, 1998) </font></p>
<p>With the financial success of <i>Cry, the Beloved Counry</i>, Paton
could leave his work at Diepkloof, which was closed within a few years,
and settle at Anerley, a seaside village in Natal. From the early 1950s
Paton began to devote himself fully to the newly formed Liberal Party.
His writer colleague Laurens van der Post, who had moved to England in
the 1930s, helped it in many ways. Van der Post knew that the South
African Secret Police was aware that he was paying money to Paton, but
could not stop it by legal procedures. In late 1960s the party was
disbanded. Before this Paton's passport was confiscated on his return
from New York in 1960, where he had been presented with the annual
Freedom Award. The passport was returned in 1970. In 1969 Paton became
founding editor of <i>Reality: A Journal of Liberal Opinion</i>. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Mkhumbane</span>, with music by Todd Matshikiza, opened in 1960 in Durban; <span style="font-style: italic;">Sponono</span> had a Broadway production in 1964. A stage musical, <i>Lost in the Stars</i>, which was inspired by <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i>,
ran for about a year on Broanway from 1949 to 1950. In the first film
version of the novel from 1951, produced and directed by Zoltan Korda,
Canada Lee played Kumalo and Charles Carson was Jarvis. Sidney Poitier
was cast as Theophilus Msimangu. Paton's other works include
biographies, a study of his friend, the cabinet minister Jan Hofmeyr,
and archibishop Geoffrey Clayton. He planned to write the biography of
the poet Roy Campbell, but eventually abandoned the project, because he
was repelled by Campbell's near-fascist views. "I could not bring
myself to admire him," he confessed to van der Post. Paton's
autobiographies were <span style="font-style: italic;">Towards the Mountain</span> (1980) and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Journey Continued</span>
(1988). The second volume, completed before his death, begins in 1948
and ends in 1968. Paton died on April 12, 1988, in his home at Botha's
Hill, near Durban, Natal. </p>
