Of all the "Great Ladies" of the English mystery's golden age, including Margery Allingham, <a href="christie.htm">Agatha Christie</a>, and <a href="dlsayers.htm">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>,
Ngaio Marsh alone survived to publish in the 1980s. Over a fifty-year
span, from 1932 to 1982, Marsh wrote thirty-two classic English
detective novels, which gained international acclaim. She did not
always see herself as a writer, but first planned a career as a painter.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As is always the case, much of what was
unearthed turned out to be of no relevance, much was of doubtful or
self-contradictory nature and only a scanty winnowing found to be of
real significance. It was as if the components of several jigsaw
puzzles had been thrown down on the table and before the one required
picture could be assembled the rest would have to be discarded."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Grave Mistake</font></i><font size="2">, 1978) </font></blockquote>
<p>Ngaio Marsh was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, the only child of
Henry Edward and Rose Elizabeth (Seager) Marsh. Her first name,
pronounced "ny-o", is a Maori word, meaning "Reflections on the water",
and was chosen by her uncle. Marsh's father, an emigrant from England,
was a clerk in the Bank of New Zealand. Rose Elizabeth was a talented
amateur actress. Her mother's grandfather was an early colonist in New
Zealand. </p>
<p>At the age of 15, Marsh entered St. Margaret's College, a private
school run by the Church of England. During this period, she became
interested in theatre and playwriting. From 1915 to 1920 she attended
Canterbury University College School of Art. Ned Bristed, her childhood
friend and fiancé, died in World War I. For a period, she taught speech
craft at the school of Drama and Dancing in Christchurch. After
painting, acting, and producing in the theater in the 1920s, she
travelled in 1928 to England, and opened, in partnership with Mrs. Tahu
Rhodes, a succesfull interior decorating business in Knightsbridge.
Marsh's stay lasted for four years. When her mother became fatally ill,
she returned to New Zealand. Her mother died in 1932, and for the
following seventeen years, Marsh took care of her elderly father. They
lived in Marton Cottage at Cashmere, where he had built a house for his
family. </p>
<p>Marsh's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Man Lay Dead</span>
(1934), which she wrote in London in 1931-32, introduced the detective
Inspector Roderick Alleyn: a combination of Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey
and a realistically depicted police official at work. Throughout the
1930s Marsh painted occasionally, wrote plays for local repertory
societies in New Zealand, and published detective novels. In 1937 Marsh
went to England. Before going back to her home country, she spent six
months travelling about Europe. </p>
<p>The critic and awarded mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included <span style="font-style: italic;">Surfeit of Lampreys</span>
(1940) among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. "Her
writing is as good as any to be found in crime fiction. Let me end with
one sentence from Surfeit of Lampreys that shows it. Roberta is
arriving by boat in London. She looks out at the other ships at anchor
in the early morning light. 'Stewards,' she says, 'pallid in their
undervests, leant out of portholes to stare.' There is an artist in
words."<font size="2"> (Keating in </font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font>In
the center of the story is the Lamprey family, English aristocrats,
seen through the eyes of a New Zealand girl. Marsh mixed in occultism
with Shakespearean details &#8211; Lord Wutherwood's eye is put out as in <i>King Lear</i>, where Shakespeare had the Duke of Gloucester tortured and blinded on stage.</p>
<p>During World War II Marsh served in a New Zealand Red Cross
Transport Unit, driving repatriated soldiers in a hospital bus. She
also worked with the drama department of Canterbury University and
settled into a yearly routine that allowed her to spend about nine
months writing a book and three months to mount a production of
Shakespeare with her students. From 1944 to 1952 she was producer for
D.D. O'Connor Theatre Management. In 1949 she returned to England and
founded the British Commonwealth Theatre Company. One of her major
directorial assignments include Pirandello's play <i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i>,
which she first saw in 1932 at the Westminster Theatre. "If you long
above everything to be a director, this is the play that nags and
clamours to be done," she later said. Working in two countries she
would spend the rest of her time between England and New Zealand,
writing mysteries during the sea voyages, and in theatrical activities.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"She thought that the English landscape,
more perhaps than any other, is dyed in the heraldic colours of its own
history. It is there, she thought, and until it disintegrates, earth,
rock, trees, grass, turf by turf, leaf by leaf and blade by blade, it
will remain imperturbably itself. To it, she thought, the reed really
is as the oak and she found the notion reassuring."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Grave Mistake</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>After the death of his father in 1948, Marsh devoted about nine
months of the year to writing and three months to theater. Curiously,
she disliked writing, according to her cousin and chief inheritor John
Dacres-Manning, but writing also provided her money for the theater
work. Her dedication in producing Shakespearean plays was recognized by
an award from the Order of the British Empire in 1949, and in 1966 she
was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her
services to literature and theater in New Zealand. In 1967 she produced
Twelfth Night to open the new Ngaio Marsh Theatre in Christchurch. Her
last full-scale production, Shakespeare's Henry V, was produced in
1972. Marsh was named in 1978 a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of
America, along with Dame Daphne du Maurier and Dorothy B. Hughes. Her
autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">Black Beech and Honeydew</span>, came out in 1966 (revised in 1981). Marsh
died in Christchurch, N.Z., on February 18, 1982. She is buried in the
churchyard of Holy Innocents at Mount Peel. Her last novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Light Thickens</span>, which blended theatre and crime, was published posthumously in 1982. </p>
<p>Marsh's best-known character is Inspector Roderick Alleyn. The name
was created as a compliment to her father, who had attended a public
school founded by the Elizabethan tragedian Edward Alleyn. Roderick
Alleyn is assisted by Inspector Fox who can quote Shakespeare. Later
Alleyn marries Agatha Troy, an absent-minded, thin, shy and funny
painter, whose character was not far from Marsh's own in the 1930s.
Another figure from the first books is the journalist Nigel Bathgate,
whom Alleyn could not tolerate. Marsh later dropped him from the
stories. Like Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey, Alleyn has a noble
background, but instead of becoming a diplomat he joined the police
force after returning from World War I. </p>
<p>Four of Marsh's Alleyn stories were set in the theatre, <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter a Murderer</span> (1935), <span style="font-style: italic;">Opening Night</span> (1951), <span style="font-style: italic;">Vintage Murder</span> (1937), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Killer Dolphin</span>
(1966). Overture to Death (1939) was set in a small village, Winston
St. Giles, where Alleyn returned occasionally in later books. In some
stories Alleyn solves murders outside England &#8211; in Australia and New
Zealand (<span style="font-style: italic;">Vintage Murder</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Colour Scheme</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Died in the Wool</span>), France (<span style="font-style: italic;">Spinsters in Jeopardy</span>), or in Italy (<span style="font-style: italic;">When in Rome</span>)
&#8211; Alleyn spoke French and Italian. During World War II Alleyn chased
spies, but after the war he continued in the same style as in the
1930s. A modern psychopath appeared in <span style="font-style: italic;">Singing in the Shrouds</span> (1959). Typical of Marsh's mysteries is vivid characterization and dialogue. Julian Symons has praised in his book <i>Bloody Murder</i> (1985) Marsh's capacity for amused observation of the undercurrents beneath ordinary social intercourse, as in the novel <i>Opening Night</i>. Marsh also wrote plays, a television play <span style="font-style: italic;">Evil Liver</span>
(Crown Court series, 1975), and a book about New Zealand. In 1978 a New
Zealand television company released adaptations of four of her novels
as the "Ngaio Marsh Theatre." </p>
<p>Although her novels had English protagonists, relied on British
class structure and social environment, she thought of herself as a New
Zealander. Marsh's long association with the aristocratic Rhodes family
colored her reticent personality, which is portrayed in the novel <i>Blue Blood</i> by Stevan Eldred-Grigg. "The more deeply and honestly," Marsh wrote in her autobiography <span style="font-style: italic;">Black Beech and Honeydew</span>,
"one examines one's characters the more disquieting becomes the
skulduggery that one is obliged to practise." The novels which Marsh
set in her home country, <i>Colour Scheme</i> (1943), <i>Vintage Murder</i>, and<i> Died in the Wool</i>
(1944), show a sympathy for the Maoris, and a love of the landscape.
Her Mount Peel homestead was memorialized as "Deepacres" in the
prologue to <span style="font-style: italic;">Death of a Peer</span> (1940). </p>
<p>As her one of her friends, Jack Henderson recalled, Marsh was "thin,
mannish in appearance, flat-chested, rather gawky . . . dressed usually
in beautifully cut slacks (less common then than now), large feet with
shoes like canal boats, a deep voice &#8211; yet intensely feminine withal"<font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">Lesbian Studies in Aotearoa/New Zealand</font></i><font size="2"> by Alison J. Laurie, 2001, p. 51). </font>During
her stays in London, she wore expensive clother to suit her
5-foot-10-inch frame, and drove a Jaguar sports car. Her second Jaguar
was a well known vehicle on The South Island of New Zealand. </p>
<p>Unlike her shy heroine, Agatha Troy, Marsh never married, but she
also denied being lesbian. She had both lesbian and gay characters in
her novels, although they were not portrayed in exceptionally positive
ways. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Hand in Glove</span> (1962)  lesbian love is ridiculed as the cross-class passion of an ageing spinster in adopting a worthless young woman. <font size="2">(<i>From Agatha Christie to Ruth Rendell: British Women Writers in Detective and Crime Fiction</i> by Susan Rowlands, 2001.) </font>Marsh's
lifelong friend was Sylvia Fox, with whom she made several trips. In
her autobiography she refers to her female companions only as
secretaries/traveling companions, and tells that she fell in love at
the age of 58 with an Russian expatriate, Vladimir Muling, who was a
married man. Marsh maintained a friendship with both members of the
couple. </p>
