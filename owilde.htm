<p>Irish poet and dramatist whose reputation rests on his comic 
masterpieces <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i> and <i>The Importance
of Being Earnest</i>. Oscar Wilde's other best-known works include his only 
novel <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1891), which deals very similar theme 
as <a href="rlsteven.htm">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s <i>Dr. Jekyll and 
Mr. Hyde</i> (1886). Wilde's fairy tales are very popular &#8211; the motifs 
have been compared to those of 
<a href="hcanders.htm">Hans Christian Andersen</a>.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When they entered they found, hanging
upon the wall, a splendid portrait of their master as they had last
seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on
the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart.
He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was not till
they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Picture of Dorian Gray</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was born in Dublin to
unconventional parents. His mother, Lady Jane Francesca Wilde
(1820-96), was a poet and
journalist. Her pen name was Sperenza. According to a story she warded
off creditors by reciting Aeschylus. Wilde's father was Sir William
Wilde, an Irish antiquarian, gifted writer, and specialist in diseases
of the eye and ear, who founded a hospital in Dublin a year before
Oscar was born. His work gained for him the honorary appointment of
Surgeon Oculist in Ordinary to the Queen. Lady Wilde, who was active in
the women's rights movement, was reputed to ignore her husbands amorous
adventures. </p>
<p>Wilde studied at Portora Royal School, in Enniskillen,
County Fermanagh (1864-71), Trinity College, Dublin (1871-74), and 
Magdalen College, Oxford (1874-78), where he was taught by Walter Pater 
and John Ruskin. Even at the age of 13, Wilde had a dandy's taste in clothing.
"The flannel shirts you sent in the hamper are both Willie's mine are
one quite scarlet and the other lilac but it is too hot to wear them
yet," he wrote in a letter to his mother. Willie, whom he mentioned,
was his elder brother. Lady Wilde's third and last child was a
daughter, named Isola Francesca, who died young. It has been said that
Lady Wilde insisted on dressing Oscar in girl's clothes because she had
longed for a girl. </p>
<p>In Oxford Wilde shocked the pious dons with his irreverent attitude
towards religion and was jeered at for his eccentric clothes. He
collected blue china and peacock's feathers, and later his velvet
knee-breeches drew much attention. Wilde was taller than most of his
contemporaries, and athletically built, but the subject of sport bored
him. In 1878 Wilde received his B.A. and on the same year he moved to
London. </p><p>Soon his lifestyle and humorous wit made him
the most talked-about advocate of Aestheticism, the late 19th century
movement in England that argued for the idea of art for art's sake. To
earn his living, Wilde worked as art reviewer (1881), lectured in the
United States and Canada (1882), and in Britain (1883-1884). Since his
childhood, Wilde had studied the art of conversation. His talk was
articulate, imaginative, and poetic. From the mid-1880s he was regular
contributor for <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> and <i>Dramatic 
View</i>. Between 1887 and 1889 he edited <i>Woman's World</i> magazine</p>
<p>Wilde married in 1884&nbsp;Constance Mary Lloyd, the daughter of
John Horatio Lloyd, a wealthy barrister, and Ada
Atkinson.&nbsp;Constance had enjoyed athorough  education, she played
the piano well, was interested in arts, embroidery, and could read
Dante in Italian. For a short period she was a member of the Hermetic
Order of the Golden Dawn. After she turned away from occultism she
became involved in Christian socialism. Wilde himself had joined the
Freemasons in the late 1870s. </p><p>On honeymoon in Paris&nbsp;Wilde and Constance&nbsp;visited the annual Paris salon, saw there Whistler's <em>Harmony in Grey and Green</em> and went to opera to see Sarah Bernhardt in<em> Macbeth</em>.
It is possible that before the marriage Wilde told&nbsp;Constance
something of his sexual past. "... I am content to let the past be
buried, it does not belong to me," she said in a letter, "I will hold
you fast with chains of love." At Portora Royal School he had had some
"sentimental friendships" with boys, and he had an encounter with a
female prostitute in Paris while going steady with Constance. Their
marriage ended in 1893, but the couple never divorced officially.
Wilde's love letters to Constance have not survived. </p>
<p><i>The Happy Prince and Other Tales</i> (1888), a collection of
fairy-stories, Wilde wrote for his two sons, Cyril and Vyvyan. Possibly
one of the pieces, 'The Selfish Giant,' was&nbsp;a joint effort between
Wilde and Constance, who published her own collection, <em>There&nbsp;Was Once</em> in the&nbsp;same year. <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> followed in 1890 and next year he brought out more fairy tales. Wilde had met a few years earlier Lord Alfred 
Douglas ("Bosie"), an athlete and a poet, who became both the love of
the author's life and his downfall. "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,"
Wilde once said. Bosie's uncle, Lord Jim, caused a scandal when he
filled in the 1891 census describing his wife as a "lunatic" and his
stepson as a "shoeblack born in darkest Africa." During a stay in
Paris, Wilde wrote Salomé in French. An anonymous English translation,
dedicated to Alfred Douglas, was published in 1894. Richard Strauss's
operatic version of the play was first performed in Dresden, five years
after Wilde's death. </p>
<blockquote><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray </i>was published first by <i>Lippincott's 
Monthly Magazine</i>
in 1890. Some of the homosexual content was censored by Lippincott
editor J. M. Stoddart. Wilde revised the novel still further before it
came out in expanded book form in 1891, added with six chapters. The
book has some parallels with Wilde's own life. At Oxford he became a
close friend of Frank Miles, a painter, and the homosexual aesthete
Lord Ronald Gower, and it seems that they both are represented in <i>Dorian Gray</i>. In the story
Dorian, a Victorian gentleman, sells his soul to keep his youth and beauty. 
The tempter is Lord Henry Wotton, who lives selfishly for amoral pleasure. 
"If only the picture could change and I could be always what I am now.
For that, I would give anything. Yes, there's nothing in the whole world
I wouldn't give. I'd give my soul for that." <font size="2">(from the film adaptation
of 1945). </font>Dorian starts his wicked acts, ruins lives, causes a young 
woman's suicide and murders Basil Hallward, his portrait painter, his 
conscience. However, although Dorian retains his youth, his painting 
ages and catalogues every evil deed, showing his monstrous image, a sign of his moral leprosy. 
The book highlights the tension between the polished surface of high life 
and the life of secret vice. In the end sin is punished. When Dorian destroys the painting, 
his face turns into a human replica of the portrait and he dies. "Ugliness is the only 
reality,'" summarizes Wilde.</blockquote>

<p>Wilde made his reputation in theatre world between the years 1892 and 1895 with a 
series of highly popular plays. <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i> (1892) dealt with a blackmailing divorcée driven to self-sacrifice by maternal love. In <i>A Woman of No Importance</i> (1893) an illegitimate son is torn between his father and mother. <i>An Ideal Husband</i> (1895)&nbsp;was about&nbsp;blackmail, political corruption and public and private honour. In <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>
(1895), a comedy of manners, John Worthing (who prefers to call himself
Jack) and Algernon Moncrieff (Algy) are two fashionable young
gentlemen. "Relly, if the lower orders don't set us a good example,
what on earth is the use of them?"&nbsp;John tells that he has a
brother called Ernest, but in town John himself is known as Ernest and
Algernon also pretends to be the profligate brother Ernest.&nbsp;<font size="2"> </font>Gwendolen
Fairfax and Cecily Cardew are two ladies whom the two snobbish
characters court. Gwendolen declares that she never travels without her
diary because "one should always have something sensational to read in
the train". </p>

<p>Before the theatrical success Wilde produced several essays, many of
these anonymously. "Anybody can write a three-volume novel. It merely
requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature," he once
stated. His two major literary-theoretical works
were the dialogues 'The Decay of Lying' (1889) and 'The Critic as
Artist' (1890). In the latter Wilde lets his character state, that
criticism is the superior part of creation, and that the critic must
not be fair, rational, and sincere, but possessed of "a temperament
exquisitely susceptible to beauty". <i>The Soul of a Man Under Socialism</i> (1891), a more traditional essay,
&nbsp;takes an 
optimistic view of the road to socialist future.&nbsp;Wilde rejects the 
Christian ideal of self-sacrifice in favor of joy. "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it."<b></b></p>

<p>Although married and the father of two children, Wilde's personal &nbsp;life 
was open to rumours. Constance had tolerated his infidelities and&nbsp;
long absences from home, but his affair with Alfred Douglas (or
'Bosie') had a catastrophic effect on the marriage. In the midst of the
crisis Constance found comfort from reading Dante's <em>Inferno</em>. During a separation from her husband in 1893 she&nbsp;took a portable Kodak camera with her to Italy, where she photographed buildings and some of the art pieces in Florence. </p><p>Wilde's
years of triumph ended, when his intimate association with Alfred
Douglas led to his trial on charges of homosexuality (then illegal in
Britain). He was sentenced two years hard labour for the crime of
sodomy. Constance went with her children to Switzerland and then to
Germany to escape the public eye. In 1895 she changed her and son's
names to Constance, Cyril and Vyvyan Holland, taking the same family
name her brother Otho used. </p><p>During his first trial Wilde defended 
himself, stating that "the 'Love that dare not speak its name' in this 
century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there 
was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his 
philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and 
Shakespeare... There is nothing unnatural about it." Mr. Justice 
Wills, stated when pronouncing the sentence, that "people who can 
do these things must be dead to all senses of shame, and one cannot hope 
to produce any effect upon them."
While he served his sentence, Bosie stood by Wilde,&nbsp;planned to
dedicate a volume of poems to him, but&nbsp;the author felt himself
betrayed and turned against him. Later they met in Naples, where they
shared a villa.&nbsp;Constance&nbsp;visited&nbsp;Wilde
in&nbsp;prison,&nbsp;too. &nbsp;Afterwards she wrote: "It was indeed
awful more so than I had any conception it could be. I could not see
him, I could not touch him, and I scarcely spoke." </p>

<p>Wilde was first in Wandsworth prison, London, and then Reading 
Gaol. When he was at last allowed pen and paper after more than 19 
months of deprivation, Wilde had became inclined to take opposite views
on the potential of humankind toward perfection. During this time he wrote 
<em>De Profundis</em> (1905), a dramatic monologue and autobiography, which was 
addressed to Alfred Douglas. "Everything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, 
lacking in style. Our very dress makes us grotesques.&nbsp;We are the zanies of 
sorrow. We are the clowns whose hearts are broken." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">De Profundis</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>

<p>After his release in 1897 Wilde lived under the name Sebastian 
Melmoth in&nbsp; Berneval, near Dieppe, then in Paris. He wrote <i>The Ballad 
of Reading Gaol,</i>
revealing his concern for inhumane prison conditions. O
n his death bed Wilde became a Roman Catholic. Wilde's friend Robbie
Ross, who became&nbsp;his literary executor,&nbsp;brought a priest to
his bedside. Wilde died of cerebral meningitis on November 30, 1900,
penniless, in a cheap Paris hotel at the age of 46.&nbsp;He was
first&nbsp;buried in the cemetery in Bagneux, and in 1909 his
remains&nbsp;were removed to the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris. </p><p>"Do you want to know the great drama of my life," asked Wilde of <a href="agide.htm">André Gide</a>.
"It's that I have put my genius into my life; all I've put into my
works is my talent." Constance died &nbsp;in 1898 in Genoa, after a
spinal surgery. Her brother Otho blamed the surgeon, Signor
Bossi,&nbsp;for his sister's death. Bossi was shot dead in 1919. Cyril
was&nbsp;killed by a German sniper in&nbsp; 1915. Vyvyan, who also
served in the army&nbsp;during WW I,&nbsp;gained fame as&nbsp;a
translator and author. His son Merlin became an acknowledged Wilde
scholar. </p>
