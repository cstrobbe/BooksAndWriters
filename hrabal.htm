      <p>Czech novelist and short story writer, whose tales show the
influence of Surrealism, Dada, and psychoanalysis. Bohumil Hrabal
gained international fame with <i>Closely Watched Trains</i> (1965),
set in German occupied Czechoslovakia during World War II. The novel
was also made into a highly successful film, directed by Jiri Menzel.
Hrabal's writings were banned after the Soviet troops invaded
Czechoslovakia in 1968. Hrabal died at the age of 82. He fell from a
window at the Bulovka hospital in Prague. According to some sources, he
was trying to feed the pigeons, according to others he commited suicide
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When I started to work at the
Golden Prague Hotel, the boss hold of my left ear, pulled me up, and
said, You're a busboy here, so remember, you don't see anything and you
don't hear anything. Repeat what I just said. So I said I wouldn't see
anything and I wouldn't hear anything."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">I Served the King of England</font></i><font size="2">, 1980)
        </font></blockquote>
      <p>Bohumil Hrabal was born near Brno, but his childhood Hrabal
spent in Nymburk, where his step-father, Franti&#353;ek Hrabal, worked as a brewery
manager. Hrabal's mother, Marie Bo&#382;ena Kiliánová, was an assistant bookkeeper; 
she married Franti&#353;ek Hrabal in 1916. <br>
</p>
      <p>Just before the World War II, Hrabal entered Charles University,
Prague. His first printed work <span style="font-style: italic;">Pr&#353;í</span> (it&#8217;s raining) was
published in 1937 Nymburk newspapers. After the Nazis closed the
universities, he took up various jobs, including a dispatcher in a
small railway station and an assistent in a small law firm in Nymburk
in 1939-1940. Hrabal received his law degree in 1946, but he never
practiced. Instead he tried a wide variety of occupations &#8211; he worked
as a commercial and insurance agent, a steelworker in Kladno foundries,
a handler of waste paper, and a stagehand in a Prague theater. These
experiences provided him much material for his tales and anecdotes. In
1956 he married Eli&#353;ka Plevová, the daughter of Karel Pleva, a
procurator and manager of a wood factory.&nbsp; </p>

      <p>Hrabal established himself relatively late as writer, at the
age of 49, although he had started to write poetry in the 1940s. Later
he focused on prose text and novellas. From the early period dates <i>Ztracená
uli&#269;ka</i> (a lost alley), his scheduled literary debut, which
eventually came out in 1991. Hrabal's first book of short stories, <span style="font-style: italic;">Perli&#269;ka na dn&#283;</span> (a little pearl at
the bottom), was not published until
1963. At that time the Czechoslovak communist regime moved toward more
liberal policy. From Surrealists, he adopted the the technique of
"automatic writing", which especially marked his works from the 1970s.
His works also show the influence of James Joyce and his
stream-of-consciousness style. </p>
      <p>In the 1960s, Hrabal's short stories inspired the Czech "new
wave" filmmakers. The film adaptation of <i>A Close Watch on the Trains</i>
won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 1967. Menzel's film
version, with its comic incidents and characters, was relatively
successful also in the United States &#8211; every major reviewer recognized
its merits. Jaromir Sofir's camerawork has a sober, understated aspect.
He consciously tried to to blend "archaic stylisation" with "the
beloved Czech version of <span style="font-style: italic;">cinéma-vérité</span>."<font size="-1"> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Making Pictures: A Century of European Cinematography</span>, 2003, pp. 286-287) </font><br>
</p>
      <p>Milos Hrama, the young protagonist, is an apprentice
stationmaster at a little rural station. He is more interested in
losing his
virginity with a lively ticket inspector, Mása, than in the ongoing war
or time schedules. Milos' maturing
ends tragically &#8211; he blows up a train and dies heroically in the act of
sabotage against the Germans. Menzel wanted a happy ending, but Hrabal
persuaded him to retain the original conclusion. "Most important, this
concluding sequence turns the entire movie into a metaphor for
Czechoslovakia itself," Richard Schickel wrote in <i>The A List: The
National Society of Film Critics' 100 Essential Films</i>, ed. by Jay
Carr (2002). "It says t hat pleasant, pleasure-loving little country,
so often occupied, so often pre-occupied by its own survivors of <i>Schweik</i>-ishness,
is more dangerous than it looks. "Menzel also filmed Hrabal's <i>Post&#345;i&#382;iny</i>
(1980), a loving portrait of the author's parents, and his uncle Pepin,
who constantly pours out incredible stories and nearly ruins his
brother's marriage and business. </p>

      <p>A few year later after the film was released, the Warsaw Pact
tanks were in Wenceslas Square, and the brief period of liberalization,
the Prague Spring 1968, ended. Two complete editions of Hrabal's books,
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Domácí úkoly&nbsp;</span>
(homeworks) and <i>Poupata</i> (buds), were
destroyed. Menzel was obliged to denounce the "errors" of the Czech new
wave. Hrabal himself also had to find a balance between his writing and
demands of the Communist regime. To see his books in print, he publicly
expressed his support for the new authorities. However, the works which
were officially published, lacked much of the spontaneity and
non-conformism of his rambling narrative, which had brought him fame. </p>
      <p>As <a href="hasek.htm">Jaroslav Hasek </a>in his time,
Hrabal spend much time in pubs, not only for the good company, but for
the tall tales and anecdotes he heard and which were washed down with
slivovitze or a mug of Pilsner Urquell. He also had a sharp ear for
colloquial speech of ordinary people, which he stylized for his books.
The smoky U Zlateho tygra (At the Golden Tiger) on Husova street was
Hrabal's favorite pub. Also<a href="vhavel.htm"> Vaclav Havel</a> felt
at home there. In 1994 President Vaclav Havel introduced there Bohumil
Hrabal to President Bill Clinton and his Secret Service. </p>
      <p>Hrabal's characters are poor workers, soldiers, political
anarchists, antiheroes, poets, social misfits, eccentrics, whose
imagination and personal histories bring colour into the meaningless
everyday life. Hrabal also continually returned to his earlier texts
and reworked his themes &#8211; good stories are worth many visions. In <i>Dancing
Lessons for the Advanced in Age</i> (1964), an old man tells of his
life and amorous adventures to six ladies in a single unfinished
sentence. The first words set the tone of the story &#8211; the narrator, an
old man, circles around the truth, just as a bee circles a flower. At
the first page he claims that he used to go to church to see beauties,
and then corrects, "well, not exactly to the church, I'm not much of a
churchgoer, but to a small shop next to the parish house..." The
narrator was perhaps partly inspired by Hrabal's eccentric uncle Pepin,
who came for a two-week visit, but stayed on for forty years.<i> The
Little Town Where Time Stood Still</i> (1978) written in 1973 and
published five years later, was Hrabal's moving homage to his energetic
uncle. </p>
      <p><i>I Served the King of England</i> was born during one summer
month in blinding sunlight. The narrator, Ditie, a waiter, becomes a
millionaire and owner of a hotel, but he loses everything when
Communists seize power. Ditie's surname refers to a child (Dite). As
Oscar Matzerath from Günter Grass' novel <i>The Tin Drum</i> (1959),
he remains small in size. Ditie is a faithful servant of the elite,
generals, presidents, ambassadors, and their orgies are natural part of
the order of things for him. Under the Nazi rule, love is turned into a
part of the Third Reich's human breeding program. Ditie is a simpleton
and a soulmate of the Good Soldier Svejk, he never grows up and do not
understand politics or history. His strength and curse is his naivety,
and at the end of the story, when he has lost everything, he again
recalls to moment when he served the Emperor of Ethiopia &#8211; but his
superior had had the honor to serve the King of England. </p>
      <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of Hrabal's writings were
published in samizdat (underground copies), or in bowdlerized versions.
Gustav Husak's regime, a loyal ally of the USSR, was not a laughing
matter. <i>Too Loud a Solitude</i> (1976) was about the physical
destruction of books, characterized by Hrabal "a crime against
humanity." The narrator Hanta operates a hydraulic press, which makes
huge cubes of waste paper. Rare books perish in his machine, "I am
nothing but a refined butcher," he thinks. Occasionally he rescues and
reads precious old books &#8211; as Hrabal himself, when he worked at a
wastepaper collection point. "It is by and from books that I've learned
that the heavens are not humane, neither the heavens nor any man with a
head on his shoulders &#8211; it's not that men don't wish to be humane, it
just goes against common sense." Because Hanta works slowly, he is
replaced by two vigorous young men. The film adaptation of <i>Too Loud
a Solidute</i> was shot with Hrabal&#8217;s participation in 1994 (directed
by Vera Cais, a Czech director who emigrated to France in 1967) and
released in 1995.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Svatby v dom&#283;</span> (1984),
      <i>Proluky</i> (1986), and <i>Vita
nuova</i> (1987), a three-volume autobiography narrated by Hrabal's
wife, appeared in the West. They were printed by
68 Publishers Corp., Josef &#352;kvorecký's and his wife's publishing house,
which brought out some hundred and thirty original works, banned in
Czechoslovakia. Skvorecký himself had emigrated for political reasons
to Canada in 1968. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Eli&#353;ka Hrabal, called Pipsi, died
after long illness in 1987. She was of German-Chech descent, and had
been employed after the war as a servant in the kitchen of the Hotel Paris, the
setting of the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">I Served the
King of England</span>. Karel Maryska (Hanta from <i>Too Loud a
Solidute</i>),
Hrabal&#8217;s life-time friend, tried to make a speech at her funeral, but
failed and stopped in tears after just a couple of words.</p>
      <p>Husak was replaced by Miklos Jakes in 1987, but dissident
activities were still suppressed. Following the fall of communism, the
writer Václav Havel was elected in 1989 by direct popular vote as
president of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. Hrabal started to
write after a long literary silence short texts, or letters addressed
to Dubenka (April Giffird), an American student. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Totální strachy</span>
(1990, Total Fears: Letters to Dubenka) Hrabal said, "I'm hurt by this
whole town in which I live, I'm hurt by this whole world, because
towards morning certain beings come to me &#8211; beings not unfamiliar to
me, on the contrary, they come slowly but surely up the escalator of my
soul, and not only their faces come into focus, but also certain
horrible events, just like a portrait, or a film, a documentary not
only about how I was ever madly in love, but also how I failed people."
      </p>
      <p>Pèter Esterházy's <i>The Book of Hrabal</i> (1990) was a
tribute to the author, in which a Hungarian writer has an internal
conversation with with Hrabal. The book was named by the <i>New York
Times Book Review</i> as one of the Notable Books of 1994. Hrabal's
surreal world has also inspired John Albert Jansen's documentary film <i>Life
is Everywhere</i> (2000). </p>
