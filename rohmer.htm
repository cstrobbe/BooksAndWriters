      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> Prolific English mystery writer,
best known for the master criminal Dr. Fu Manchu and his opponents
Denis Nayland Smith, Dr. Petrie, named after the Egyptologist Flinders
Petrie, and the beautiful Kâramanéh, the source of Petrie's daydreams,
whose "eyes held a challenge wholly Oriental in its appeal." In spite
of Rohmer's popularity, his family lived for long periods in poverty
because of the bad deals he made with publishers.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Imagine a person, tall, lean and
feline, high shouldered, with a brow like Shakespeare and a face like
Satan, a close-shaven skull, and long, magnetic eyes of the true
cat-green. Invest him with all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern
race, accumulated in one giant intellect, with all the resources of
science past and present, with all the resources, if you will, of a
wealthy government &#8211; which, however, already has denied all knowledge
of his existence. Imagine that awful being, and you have a mental
picture of Dr Fu Manchu, the yellow peril incarnate in one man..."</b>
(from </font><i><font size="2">The Mystery of Dr Fu Manchu</font></i><font size="2">, 1913) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Sax Rohmer was born Arthur Henry Ward in Birmingham of Irish
parents. His father, William Ward, was employed as an office clerk and
eventually held the position of office manager. Rohmer's mother,
Margaret Mary (Furey) Ward, was neurasthenic and increasingly dependent
on alcohol. Young Sax Rohmer received no formal schooling until he was
nine or ten years old, but his father probably taught his son to read.
Rohmer adopted the name Sarsfield at the age of 18, impressed by his
mother's alcoholic claims of being descended from a famous 17th-century
Irish general Patrick Sarsfield. He later explained that the pen name
came from "sax" which was Saxon for "blade" and "rohmer" which meant
"roamer". </p>
      <p>After finishing his schooling, Rohmer worked in odd jobs, but
even as a child, he had dreamt of becoming a writer. He was briefly a
bank clerk in Threadneedle Street, then a clerk in a gas company, an
errand boy at a small local newspaper, and a reporter on the weekly <i>Commercial
Intelligence</i>. At the age of 20 Rohmer started his writing career.
"My earliest interests," he later said, "were centered in Ancient Egypt
and I accumulated a large library on Egyptology and occult literature."
In 1903 Rohmer's first short story, 'The Mysterious Mummy', appeared in
      <i>Pearson's Weekly</i>. He made a short trip to the Continent
and upon his return started to make his way in the cheap literary
printing business and the theatrical world. </p>
      <p>In 1909 he married Rose Elizabeth Knox, whose father had been
a well-known comedian in his youth. When Rose Knox met Rohmer she was
performing in a juggling act with her brother Bill. For almost two
years they kept the marriage a secret from Rose's family &#8211; she lived
with her sister and Rohmer with his father. Rose was psychic and Rohmer
himself seemed to attract metaphysical phenomena. There's a story, that
he consulted with his wife a ouija board as to how he could best make a
living. The answer was 'C-H-I-N-A-M-A-N'. </p>
      <p>Rohmer wrote comedy sketches for entertainers, and continued
to produce stories and serials for the newspaper and magazine markets.
These early writings were later gathered into collections. Rohmer's
first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Pause!</span> came out
in 1910, and his first Fu Manchu novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu</span>, three
years later. It gained immediate success. In the character of the
seemingly deathless Dr. Fu Manchu, the leader of Si-Fan organization,
Rohmer expressed racist fears, which had produced the concept of the
"Yellow Peril" &#8211; according to racist prejudices the Chinese were
mandarin warlords and opium-den keepers in Limehouse. Sinister Oriental
Fu Manchu stereotypes were feared since the turn of the century,
appearing in great numbers in popular fiction. From post-WW II era
perhaps the most famous example of the type is Dr. No from <a href="ifleming.htm">Ian Fleming</a>'s James Bond novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> Dr. No</span> (1958). Rohmer himself
never visited China, but he know about the Chinatown of London. He did
there some research for an article about a Chinese named Mr. King,
reputedly connected to organized crime. </p>
      <p>The sociologist Virginia Berridge has estimated, that the
ethnic Chinese population in London's East End, in the period of 1900
through to the Second World War, was counted only in hundreds. The
majority of the population worked in such professions as cooking and
the laundering of clothes. Most of the cocaine came from Germany, where
it was sold almost without restriction. This irrational racist hatred
also oozed from the novels of Edgar Wallace and John Buchan, who often
included wicked Jews in his work. In 2001 a Saudi Arab and real-life
character, Osama bin Laden, became known as the greatest terrorist
mastermind of the time. He has also disappeared mysteriously. "Here,
perhaps, lies one of the secrets of Fu Manchu's power to fascinate,"
Clive Bloom wrote in <i>Cult Fiction</i> (1996). "The Sinophobic
message of Rohmer's books is underpinned by three theories: the notion
of conspiracy which is based upon a corporate, international secret
society acting out of Limehouse, the notion of a parallel supernatural
plane of existence and the notion of eternal recurrence." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"Greeting! I am recalled home by
One who may not be denied. In much that I came to do I have failed.
Much that I have done I would undo; some little I have undone. Out of
fire I came--the smoldering fire of a thing one day to be a consuming
flame; in fire I go. Seek not my ashes. I am the lord of the fires!
Farewell. </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">"FU-MANCHU."'</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Mystery of
Dr. Fu-Manchu</font></i><font size="2">, 1913) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Originally Fu Manchu was introduced in 'The Zayat Kiss' in the
October 1912 issue of the British magazine <i>The Story-Teller</i>. Fu
Manchu had green eyes, "an emanation of Hell", as Rohmer wrote. Sir
Denis Nayland Smith is the opponent of the diabolically ingenious
villain for more than a quarter of a century. He is a spymaster,
Burmese Commissioner, and a controller of the British Secret Service
and the CID. During the following years the stories were published in
collections, but at the end of the third book <span style="font-style: italic;">The Si-Fan Mysteries</span> (1917), Fu
Manchu is supposedly dead, and another villain has taken his place.
'"That is almost incredible," I said; terror can have no darker meaning
than that which Dr. Fu-Manchu gave to it. Fu-Manchu is dead, so what
have we to fear?" "We have to fear," replied Smith throwing himself
into a corner of the settee, "the Si-Fan!"' </p>
      <p>In 1915 Rohmer invented the detective character Gaston Max,
who appeared first in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Yellow Claw</span>.
Another interesting serial character was the occult detective Morris
Klaw, who solved his cases by using his own dreams and visions. Sumuru
was a female master plotter, whom Rohmer abandoned after five published
volumes. She appeared also in such films as <i>The Million Eyes of
Sumuru</i> (1967), starring and Shirley Eaton (as Su Maru), Frankie
Avalon and George Nader, <i>The Seven Secrets of Sumuru</i> (1969),
starring Shirley Eaton, Richard Wyler and George Sanders, and <i>Sumuru</i>
(2003) starring Alexandra Kamp-Groeneveld. The detective Paul Harley
was the hero of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Fire-Tongue</span>
(1921) and<span style="font-style: italic;"> B
At-Wing</span> (1921). Chief Inspector Red Kerry solved crimes in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dope, a Story of Chinatown</span> (1919)
and other stories. <i>Dope</i> was one of the earliers thrillers with
a drug trafficing theme.</p>
      <p>For periods during the 1920s and 1930s, Rohmer was one of the
most widely read and most highly paid magazine writers in the English
language. He also produced works for the stage, and created tunes to
several of his songs by humming them and having them transcribed by a
collaborator. Rohmer's interest in mysticism and the occult made him
join the occult organization of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
Its other members included Aleister Crowley and William Butler Yeats.
Reportedly Rohmer's family doctor, Dr. R. Watson Counsell, initiated
him into the Rosicrucian Society. Rohmer also wrote an introduction for
Councell's book <i>Apologia Alchymiae</i>. Rohmer's supernatural
stories include <span style="font-style: italic;">Brood of the Witch-Queen </span>(1918), in which an Egyptian mummy is revived to practise
ancient sorcery in the modern world, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Grey Face</span> (1924), in which a
supposed reincarnation of Cagliostro causes much havoc. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Green Eyes of Bâst</span> (1920) was
an occult detective tale about the mysteries of ancient Egypt. </p>
      <p>Success brought Rohmer financial security &#8211; for a short time.
He traveled with his wife in the Near East, Jamaica, and in Egypt, and
built a country house called Little Gatton in the Surrey countryside.
But the money went as fast as it had come &#8211; Rohmer's business instincts
were not good and he gambled away much of his earnings at Monte Carlo.
In 1955 Rohmer was said to have sold the film, television and radio
rights in his books for more than four million dollars. </p>
      <p><i>The Fu Manchu</i> series started again after years of
silence with <span style="font-style: italic;">Daughter of Fu Manchu</span>
(1931); she was later featured in the film <i>Esclavas del crimen</i>
(1987), directed by Jesus Franco. Lina Romay, Franco's wife, played the
daughter, who is named in the book Fah Lo Suee ("Sweet Perfume"). <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bride of Fu Manchu</span> (1933) was
set in France and narrated by Petrie's friend Dr. Alan Sterling, an
amateur biologist. This time Fu Manchu has invented a "super plague".
Nayland Smith is appointed "Federal Agent 56" in <span style="font-style: italic;">President Fu Manchu</span> (1936), in
which Manchu tries to install his favorite as the next president of the
U.S. Noteworthy, in&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The Drums
of Fu Manchu</span> (1939), which was published before the start of the
Second World War, Fu Manchu schemes to kill all potential warmongers &#8211;
he wants to maintain world peace. However, Sir Lionel Barton, the
greatest Orientalist in Europe, says in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Island of Fu Manchu</span> (1941),
that Fu Manchu is "an enemy whose insects, bacteria, stranglers,
strange poisons, could do more harm in a week than Hitler's army could
do in a year." By the time of the writing of this book, the United
States had not joined the World War II. This time Fu Manchu's secret
long-term plan is to weaken the US military. </p>
      <p>After the war the Rohmers moved to New York City. In order to
qualify for permanent-resident status, they had to leave the country
temporarily. From New York they moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, before
finally settling in White Plains, New York. Rohmer's later works
include <span style="font-style: italic;">Hangover House </span>(1949),
based on an unproduced play from the late 1930s, and the Sumuru series,
five paperback novels published between 1950 and 1956.</p>
      <p>During the Korean War period, Rohmer declared that Dr. Fu
Manchu was "still an enemy to be reckoned with and as menacing as ever,
but he has changed with the times. Now he is against the Chinese
Communists and, indeed, Communists everywhere, and a friend of the
American people." Sax Rohmer died from a combination of pneumonia and
stroke on June 1, 1959. <span style="font-style: italic;">Emperor Fu Manchu</span> (1959) was Rohmer's last work of fiction. While
hunting for his arch enemy, Nayland Smith disguises himself as a
Chinese munk. At one turn, Fu Manchu suggest cooperation in bringing
down the Communists. "You are perfectly aware that the Si-Fan is
intertional," Fu Manchu says. "Ridding China of Communism is one of its
objectives &#8211; yes. But ridding<i> the world</i> of this Russian
pestilence is its main purpose." </p>
      <p>The golden age of Fu Manchu stories, and also the peak of Sax
Rohmer's career, was in the 1930s, although the Chinese super-criminal
was revived again in 1957. A sequel<i> Ten Years Beyond Baker Street </i>(1984),
in which the Evil Doctor fights Sherlock Holmes, was written by Cay Van
Ash, a friend of Rohmer who had lived for thirty years in Japan. It was
followed by <i>The Fires of Fu Manchu</i> (1987). Five Fu Manchu works
were translated into Japan before WW II, but not into Chinese. </p>
      <p>There are also radio adaptations, and a Marvel comic (The
Hands of Shang-Chi), the TV series<i> The Adventures of Fu Manchu</i>
(1955-56), starring Glenn Gordon as Fu Manchu and Lester Matthews as
Nayland Smith. This revitalizing of the evil genius was produced by
Republic Productions Inc., Studio City Television Productions. Rohmer's
villain has inspired several movies, starring amongst others Boris
Karloff, Christopher Lee, and Peter Sellers (<i>The Fiendish Plot of Dr
Fu Manchu</i> in 1980). John Carradine and Sir Cedric Hardwicke played
Fu Manchu and Nyland Smith in a television pilot directed by William
Cameron Menzies. </p>
      <p>In Finland, the Library Office at the Ministry of Education
viewed Rohmer's works with suspicion. From the 1910s the office
published <i>Arvosteleva kirjaluettelo</i> (Critical Book Catalogue),
a more or less official guide for librarians in their book selection.
It constantly warned of buying cheap novels and other popular
literature for public libraries. Sax Rohmer's work received in the
1920s mixed reviews: <i>Fu-Manchu, kauhujen mies</i> (The Mystery of
Dr. Fu-Manch<i>u</i>, 1923): "Horror story, written quite skilfully." <i>Kuolleista
noussut tri Fu-Mnchu</i> (The Devil Doctor, 1925): "Adventure stories
about the strange Dr. Fu-Manchu have been translated into Finnish
before. They are written fairly skillfully and have plenty of suspense
and Oriental atmosphere. But first of all, they are horror stories and
they are not generally recommendable." This recommendation was given by
Helle Cannelin, director of the Library Office 1921-49. Cannelin did
not like Conan Doyle's detective novels either. In his review of <i>Keltainen
kynsi </i>(The Yellow Claw, 1927), <i>Tulikieli</i> (Fire-Tongue,
1927), Martti Tolvanen, Lic.Med, wrote: "The writer is not totally
untalented, but it looks as if he is putting on paper miserable
adventure stories with a sneer. However, they have readers here and
elsewhere &#8211; among young boys, who knows. Worth only for 'a collection
of insignificant books.'" </p>

Stone, Karen Morley, Charles Starrett, Myrna Loy.</font><i><font size="2"> </font></i><font size="2"><b>"Karloff </b></font><b><font size="2">is outrageously evil, leering as he tries to acquire the mask
and scimitar of Genghis Khan, which will cause the superstitious hordes
of the East to rally round him as he exterminates the civilised West.
Lewis Stone is a properly xenophobic Nayland Smith, treating all
heathens as beneath contempt, and the movie gets the most out of a
bizarre series of torture devices: a giant bell that never stops
ringing, driving mad the tethered victim beneath it; a see-saw
positioned over an alligator pit: and a pair of spiked walls that close
on a trapped subject... <i>Mask of Fu Manchu</i> is not the
definitive, nor even the best, Fu Manchu film, but it is the most
delirious."</font></b><font size="2"> (The BFI Companion to Crime, ed.
