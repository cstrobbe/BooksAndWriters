      <p>Hungarian novelist, essayist, and translator, the winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2002. In his semiautobiographical
novels Kertész has analyzed the experience of the individual during
barbaric times, especially exemplified in the Holocaust. Kertész early
prose exhibit existentialist traits but his works are difficult to
classify within any stylistic trend. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Auschwitz must have been hanging
in the air for a long, long time, centuries, perhaps like a dark fruit
slowly ripening in the sparkling rays of innumerable ignominious deeds,
waiting to finally drop on one's head."</b> (in</font><font size="2"> </font><i><font size="2">Kaddish for a Child not Born</font></i><font size="2">, 1990)
        </font></blockquote>
      <p>Imre Kertész was born in Budapest into a family of Jewish
descent. According to a story, he received at the age of ten a
diary as a birthday present, but its white pages scared him. In his
youth Kertész experienced the horrors of the Nazi system. Germans
occupied Hungary in 1944 and began exterminating Jews and Gypsies.
Kertész was deported together with 7,000 Hungarian Jews from Budapest
to Auschwitz.&nbsp;There he spent a few days and&nbsp;was then
transferred&nbsp;to Buchenwald and Zeitz. "I am a nonbelieving Jew",
Kertész has said in an interview. "Yet as a Jew I was taken to
Auschwitz." In the factory of death Kertész suddenly realized that he
could be killed anywhere at any time. This existentialist moment became
crucial for him as a writer. </p>
      <p>In 1945 Kertész was liberated by the Allied forces. After
returning to Hungary, he was employed&nbsp;as a journalist&nbsp;by <i>Világosság</i>,
a Budapest newspaper. When the newspaper adopted orthodox Communist
ideology, Kertész was dismissed. For a while he worked in a factory.
Between 1951 and 1953 Kertész served in the army, and then devoted
himself entirely to writing. </p>
      <p>During the Hungarian uprising of 1956, some 200,000 people
fled to the West. Literary life did not return to normality until 1963.
Like a number of dissident writers in European countries under
Communist dictatorship, Kertész supported himself as a translator,
focusing on such German-language writers as Hugo von Hofmannsthal,
Elias Canetti, Joseph Roth, and Arthur Schnitzler, and such thinkers as
Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. For the
theatre he wrote musicals and other light pieces. Kertész did not have
a typewriter. He first wrote with a pencil, then with a ballpoint pen. </p>
      <p>Kertész never joined the official Writers' Association and did
not have any privileges. With his wife he lived in a small one-room
flat, writing in his voluntary "prison cell" without much possibilities
getting his books published. At the Lukács bathing establishment, where
he could discuss relatively freely about literature and politics, he
swam daily for nearly 40 years. Among the modern novels which
influenced him deeply was Albert Camus's <i>The Stranger</i> (1942),
found from a second-hand shop. </p>
      <p>Kertész's first book, <i>Sorstalanság</i> (1975), was a
detached account of a fifteen-year-old Jewish boy's experiences in
concentration camps. Kertész do not regard this as an autobiographical
work. In an interview he has said, that he has never wanted to tell
about his own life. <i>Sorstalanság</i> was completed in 1965, but not
published until 10 years later in a limited edition. The work was
treated with silence, perhaps because of the subject, the deportation
of Jews, a shameful episode in Hungary's recent history. However, it
started a trilogy, which continued in <i>A kudarc </i>(1988, Fiasco),
and <i>Kaddis a meg nem születetett gyermekért </i>(1990, Kaddish for
a Child not Born), written in a stream of consciousness technique. The
protagonist is a middle-aged survivor of the Holocaust, whose literary
career has been unsuccessful. His marriage has failed and his ex-wife
has a new family and children. The tremendous truth of Auschwitz is
revealed to him in the figure of a father, and he tell to his friend
that he does not want to become a parent in a world, which has given
birth to the Holocaust.</p>
      <p>The young witness of the Shoah in <i>Sorstalanság</i> is
physically imprisoned in a concentration camp, but he argues that "It
is true that our imagination remains free even in captivity. I could,
for instance, achieve this freedom while my hands were busy with a
shovel or a pickax&nbsp;&#8211; with a moderate exertion, limiting myself to
the most essential movements only." The Holocaust survivor of <i>A
kudarc</i> is Kertész's alter ego, György Köves, who lives in a
totalitarian state. He has finished his first novel, a memoir about
Auschwitz, which has been turned down by the publisher, and he works on
his second book, which is funny in the way that Kafka and Ha&#353;ek are
funny. During a political crisis&nbsp;&#8211; the Hungarian uprising?&nbsp;&#8211;
he is allowed to leave the country, but he decides to stay. "I want to
flee but something holds me back", he thinks, trapped like Sisyphus. </p>
      <p>Thinking he is too old to learn another language, Kertész also
decided to stay in Hungary. The author has once said, that infantile
language is the only means of expression in dictatorship. In his search
for the meaning of Auschwitz in a wider historical and political
context, Kertész followed the example of many intellectuals in European
Socialist countries, who disguised their writings about totalitarianism
as portrayals of Nazism. But for Kertész there is nothing
incomprehensible in concentration camps. Evil in the world is not a
mistake or accident, but a result of rational acts of individuals. Good
is not rational; it has no explanation. </p>
      <p>In the early 1980s Kertész was still relatively unknown writer
in his own country. He was not mentioned in <i>A History of Hungarian
literature</i>, edited by Tibor Klaniczay (1983), and Lóránt Czigány
mentioned him only in passing in <i>The Oxford History of Hungarian
Literature </i>(1984). Since the "quiet revolution" of 1989, Kertész's
work started to gain international attention. His books were translated
into French, Swedish, German and English, but for example in the United
States he&nbsp;still remained less well known than his&nbsp;fellow
writers Péter Esterházy and <a href="nadas">Péter Nádas</a>. Kertész
himself once said, that "I know my books are not so popular here
because the Holocaust in not embedded in Hungarian
consciousness".&nbsp; For a time Kertész was a member of the Hungarian
Writers' Association, but he then resingned in protest; the
organization was accused of Anti-Semitic statements. A leader of the
governmental party, the poet Sándor Csoóri, wrote in a right-wing
journal, "Liberal Hungarian Jewry intends to 'assimilate' the
Hungarians to their style and thinking."</p>
      <p>In the 1990s Kertész published more works than in the previous
decades. <i>A Számuzött nyelv</i> (2001), a collection of essays,
included his address at Berlin's Renaissance Theatre in November 2000.
Kertész ended it with the word "Love"&nbsp;&#8211; "Und wenn Sie jetzt
fragen, was mich heute noch hier auf Erden hält, was mich am Leben
hält, antworte ich, ohne zu zögern: die Liebe." According to Kertész,
we can speak today of the globalization of the Holocaust, or even its
inflation. In another essay, published in <i>Die Zeit</i>, Kertész
dismissed Stephen Spielberg's film <i>Schildler's List</i> as kitsch.
The Holocaust is a trauma of the whole European civilization, not only
a matter between the Jews and the Germans. After the Nobel Prize,
Kertész finished the novel <i>Felszámolás</i> (2003), in which a
publisher tries to find the lost work of a writer, a Holocaust
survivor, who has committed suicide. </p>
      <p>With his second wife Magda Kertész&nbsp; has spent much time
in
Germany, writing and lecturing there. Magda Kertész had left Hungary
already in 1956. She lived in Chicago for 33 years before returning to
Europe. In November 2012 Kertész told the German weekly <span style="font-style: italic;">Der Spiegel </span>that he does not wish
to write any more. He has suffered from Parkinson's desease, but the
reason behind his retirement was that he considered his oeuvre, closely
related to the Holocaust, as closed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Kertész's literature awards before the Nobel prize include the
Brandenburg Literature Prize (1995), The Book Prize for European
Understanding (1997), the WELT-Literaturpreis in 2000, Ehrenpreis der
Robert-Bosch-Stiftung (2001), and Hans-Sahl-Preis (2002). In April 2002
a conference was held on his works. <i>A gondolatnyi csend, amíg a
kivégzoosztag újratölt</i> (1998), a collection of writings, sums up
much of Kertész's thinking from a long period. <i>Fateless</i> was
made into a film in 2005, directed by Lajos Koltai, and starring
Marcell Nagy, Gyuri Koves and Daniel Craig.&nbsp;<br>
