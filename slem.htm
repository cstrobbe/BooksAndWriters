      <p>Polish satirical and philosophical science fiction writer,
whose novel <em>Solaris </em>(1961) was filmed by Andrei Tarkovsky in
1971. By the beginning of the 2000s, Stanislaw Lem's books had been
translated into&nbsp;more than&nbsp;40 languages and sold
about&nbsp;almost 35&nbsp;million copies worldwide. He
was&nbsp;one&nbsp;of&nbsp;the best SF authors of the late 20th century
not to write in English. Though&nbsp;Lem told his stories often
in&nbsp;a humorous tone,&nbsp;he examined serious moral questions about
technological progress and the course of our civilization, and our
place in the universe. A central theme in his work is the limits of
human understanding of the universe.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"Oh, I read good books, too,
but only Earthside. Why that is, I don't really know. Never stopped to
analyze it. Good books tell the truth, even when they're about things
that never have been and never will be. They're truthful in a different
way. When they talk about outer space, they make you feel the silence,
so unlike the Earthly kind&nbsp;</strong></font><font size="2">&#8211;<strong>
and the lifelessness. Whatever the adventures, the message is always
the same: humans will never feel at home out there." </strong>(from
'Pirx's Tale' in <i>More Tales of Pirx The Pilot</i>, 1983) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Stanis&#322;aw Lem was born in Lwów (now Lvov, Ukraine), the son of
Samuel Lem, a prosperous physician (a laryngologist), and Sabine Lem
(née Wollner). The family lived on the second floor of Number Four of
Brajerska Street.&nbsp;Throughout his childhood Lew&nbsp;devoured books
voraciously&nbsp;&#8211; he read poetry, novels, popular science books, and
his father's anatomy books. With his father he used to walk to the
Jesuit Garden or toward Saint Jur's Orthodox Church, the enormous
barrel in the garden appeared later in a Lem's story, 'The Garden of
Darkness'. At the age of twelve he received from his father as a
present a manual Remington Underwood; with this typewriter&nbsp; Lem
wrote his books. </p>
      <p>In an autobiographical essay Lem told, that when his IQ was
measured in high school, it was over 180. After finishing high school
in 1939, Lem&nbsp;entered the&nbsp;Lvov's Medical Institute, but his
studies were interrupted by WW II&nbsp;&nbsp;and he moved
to&nbsp;Cracow, where he continued his studies in Jagiellonian
University.&nbsp;To avoid being drafted, he did not take his final
exams until 1948. </p>
      <p>During the war and Nazi occupation Lem worked in the daytime
in a German carshop as a mechanic and welder, and at hight he was a
member of the resistance fighting against the Germans. With false
papers that concealed his Jewish origins, he avoided concentrations
camps. Toward the end of the war Poland was occupied by the Red Army
and the country was closely controlled&nbsp;by the Soviet Union for the
next 50 years. Lem's family had lost all of their possessions in the
course of the war. After finishing his studies Lem received his MD. He
worked a research assistant&nbsp;at Cracow's Science Council&nbsp;and
started to write stories on his spare time. He also
contributed&nbsp;articles&nbsp;to the professional press. In 1953, he
married Barbara Lesniak, a young student of medicine.</p>
      <p>In the beginning of his career Lem published lyrical verse,
essays on scientific method and realistic novels. His
first&nbsp;novel&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Czlowiek z Marsa</em></span>
(1946),&nbsp; appeared&nbsp;in a serialized form in&nbsp;the Kraków
maganine <em>Nowy Swiat Prygod</em>. In the 1950s Lem turned seriously
into science fiction, publishing&nbsp; <span class="st"><em>Astronauci</em></span>
(1951, The Astronauts),&nbsp;<em>Oblok Magellana</em> (1955, <span class="st">The Magellanic Cloud</span>), and <em>Eden</em> (1959), a
prophecy in which five ship-wrecked space traveling scientist explore a
world where chemical manipulation is a part of the social lassez-faire.
The Russian translators demanded a number of revisions to be made to <em>The
Astronauts</em>, but eventually to book got published. He
had&nbsp;finished in 1948-49 a three-volume autobiographical&nbsp;novel
      <span class="st"><em>Czas nieutracony</em></span>, but it did not
appear until 1957&nbsp;&#8211; due to its first volume which was a problem
for the censor. <em>Hospital of the Transfiguration</em> (1956), a
novel set in a mental institution during the first days of WW II, came
out three years after Stalin's death. Lem's literary awards from the
1950s include the Golden Cross of Achievement (1955) and City of
Cracow's Prize in Literature (1957). </p>
      <p>Lem's early novels and stories were more or less optimistic
and based on the conventions of Socialist Realism. He examined
technological development, future civilizations, and responsibility of
scientist.&nbsp;During the 1960s Lem's vision became more independent,
experimental, and radical. Although the communist&nbsp;Polish
government did not tolerate criticism, authorities regarded science
fiction as an unimportant genre of literature. This made possible to
ask politically forbidden questions about progress under the disguise
of harmless fantasy. "I wrote my works from a perspective intended to
bypass all Marxist cencors, simply because I would move about in
philosophical and futurological&nbsp;domains where they had nothing to
say", Lem explained in an interview. After the collapse of the Soviet
system, he noted that "literature, which refers only to a very concrete
type of totalitarian relations, loses a lot of its social relevance and
vitality when the system which it critiques collapses." <font size="2">(in
'Reflections on Literature, Philosophy, and Science', <em>A Stanislaw
Lem Reader</em>, 1997)</font> </p>
      <p>In the 1960s Lem was very productive: he wrote<em> Cyberiada</em>
(1965, The Cyberiad), a satire in in which two robots have too creative
talents, <span class="st"><em>Opowiesci o pilocie Pirxie</em><strong> </strong></span>(1968),
stories about Pilot Pirx, and <span class="st"><em>Summa Technologiae</em><strong>
      </strong></span>(1964), philosophical essays on cybernetics and
biology, the title referring to Aquinas's<em> Summa Theologiae</em>.
The title of <em>The Cyberiad</em>&nbsp; was formed from&nbsp;<i>The
Iliad </i>and "cybernetics". Because&nbsp;this interdisciplinary study
was banned in&nbsp;Marxist science, Lem, who had read Norbert Wiener's <em>Cybernetics</em>
(1948), invented a new term, "mechanioristics."&nbsp;A member of the
Polish Cybernetics society,&nbsp;Lem&nbsp;took an active role in
rehabilitation of cybernetics in the Soviet Union. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="st"><em>Bajki robotów</em><strong> </strong></span>(1964)
was a mixture of fairy tales, social satire, and science fiction, in
which highly developed artificial beings have all the negative personal
and societal traits of human beings. "The theme he stresses in most of
his work,"&nbsp;said Phil José Farmer in<i> The New York Times</i>, "is
that machines will someday be as human as Homo sapiens and perhaps
superior to him. Mr. Lem has an almost Dickensian genius for vividly
realizing the tragedy and comedy of future machines; the death of one
of his androids or computers actually wrings sorrow from the reader."<font size="2"> (September 2, 1984) </font></p>
      <p>Lem's adventure stories about Ijon Tichy, an astronaut, laugh
at commonly accepted ideas and play with bizarre inventions. In one
story an inventor keeps his wife's ''soul'' in a small box, and in
another a robot proves to be a bad mountain climber. A scientist
invents a time machine, in which he ages and dies. Ijon Tichy appeared,
among others, in <i>The Star Diaries</i> (1957) and the collection <i>The
Futurological Congress</i> (1971). <i>Peace on Earth</i> (1987) was
about military technology. One high-tech weapon slices through the left
and right hemispheres of the legendary polymath. As a consequence,
Tichy can type only with his right hand, while his left pinches women's
behinds and otherwise acts with a will of its own. The fate of nations
may depend on the secrets of his confused mind. </p>

      <p><i>Memoirs Found in a Bathtub</i> (tr. 1973) is a story about
an aspiring agent, who seeks his mission and the meaning of his
existence. In <i>Return from the Stars</i> (tr. 1980) a space pilot
returns to Earth after a 10 year journey. He has to adjust himself to a
new world&nbsp;&#8211; meanwhile 120 years had passed in Earth time. <i>Imaginary
Magnitude</i> (tr. 1984), moves into the literary world of <a href="jlborges.htm">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, and consists only of
introductions&nbsp;to 16 (imaginary) books. However, Lem has criticized
Borges's hermetic approach to literature: "We are building newer,
richer, and more terrible paradises and hells; but in his books Borges
knows nothing about them."<i> </i></p>
      <p><i>A Perfect Vacuum</i> (1971) was a collection of
essays masqueraded as reviews of books that have not yet been written.
The second ''review'' is about ''the military evolution of
civilization'', seen from the viewpoint of the 21st century. It
describes how arms builders managed to overcome all obstacles and
create really effective "synsects'' to fight a modern war. "The war of
good and evil present in all religions does not always end, in every
faith, with the victory of good, but in every one it establishes a
clear order of existence. The sacred as well as the profane rests on
that universal order..."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">One
Human Minute</font></i><font size="2">)</font> <em>Fiasco</em> (1986,
tr. 1987) was a meditation on the nature of culture and technology, in
which aliens avoid contact with humans. A spaceship, the Hermes, is
sent to Quinta, which reveals evidence of life but remains silent. When
the spaceship approches the planet, they find out that the Quintas have
developed a Cosmic War Zone. </p>
      <p>Lem's most famous work, <i>Solaris,</i> is among the classic
science fiction novels of the 1960s. In it the author explored one of
his favorite subjects&nbsp;&#8211; the limitations of human understanding.
The story is set in a space station hovering above the planet Solaris.
Scientists probe the mysteries the planet where the only living thing
is an intelligent ocean, that covers the whole surface. <a href="tarkov.htm">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>'s film adaptation of the novel
from 1972 has been called the <i><a href="kubrick.htm">2001: A Space
Odyssey </a></i>of Russian sci-fi cinema.
Noteworthy
, the director was not interested in special effects or superficial
science fiction elements, rockets and space stations, and later said
that the film "would have stood out more vividly and boldly had we
managed to dispense with these things altogether." </p>
      <p>In the film a scientist (Donatis Banionis) is sent to
investigate why his colleagues have suffered mental breakdowns on the
space station. He discovers that the mysterious organic, sentient
"ocean" of the planet is capable of either reproducing images and
people from a person's past, innermost obsessions, or causing him to
fantasize that he is seeing such visions. Banionis himself is haunted
by a reincarnation of his suicided wife (Natalja Bondartshuk), who
appears in physical form. Horrified he kills her, but a replica arrives
again, and the meetings forces him to face up the past events of his
life. The vast fluid "brain" remains enigma for human intelligence and
probing&nbsp;&#8211; the phantoms may be an attempt by it to communicate.
Towards the end of the movie&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;differing from Lem's
novel&nbsp;&#8211; Solaris replicates a small portion of Earth upon its
surface.&nbsp;Also, not fully happy with
&nbsp;Steven Soderbergh's version of the novel, Lem said that "the book
was <i>not</i> dedicated to erotic problems of people in outer
space..." Lem had reservations about Tarkovsky's adaptation, too: "he
didn't make <i>Solaris</i> at all, he made <i>Crime and Punishment</i>."
      </p>
      <p>In his memoirs, <i>Highcastle: A Remembrance</i> (1997), Lem
described his childhood as the son of a doctor in Lvov between the two
world wars. His favorite writers were Sienkiewicz, Verne, Dumas and
Wells. The book ends in his military training in 1935. "During the
three years of my military training," Lem wrote, "there was no mention
made, not once, of the existence of tanks." Four years later the Polish
Army fought against German tanks on horseback. </p>
      <p>Several of Lem's books were translated into English in the
1980s, and his writings appeared in such magazines as <i>The New Yorker</i>,
      <i>Penthouse</i>, and <i>Omni</i>. Though he traveled
extensively in Europe, he refused all invitations to North America.
Between 1982&nbsp;and 1988&nbsp;Lem lived in Germany, Austria and
Italy, but while abroad he did not identify himself with the dissident
writers.&nbsp;On the other hand, he refused to join the government-run
Writer's Union. In 1985 he received Austrian State Award for Culture.
Summarizing the results of the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial
Intelligence) project, Lem said in 1983 that he considers the universe
silent.&nbsp;Lem returned in 1988&nbsp;to Poland, where a wave of
strikes forced the government to recognize the Solidarity union, which
sought workers' rights and liberties. He had enjoyed his life in the
West, but found the intellectual life in his own home country more
interesting. </p>
      <p>Upon the publication of&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Pokój na
Ziemi</em> </span>(1987, Peace on Earth), an Ijon Tichy satire on the
moon, Lem announced that he will finish his career as a novelist
and&nbsp;focus only on essays and columns. Lem expressed his
disappointment in current science fiction in <i>Microwords: Writings
on Science Fiction and Fantasy</i> (1984). Science fiction should
examine, according to Lem, scientific problems or mysteries, but it
offers hostile monsters and juvenile fantasy. However, in 2000 Lem
published a new novel, <em>Okamgnienie</em>, about how the word ends
happily. Lem died of heart failure on 27 March, 2006, in Cracow. </p>
