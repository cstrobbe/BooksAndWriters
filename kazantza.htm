      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific Greek writer, whose works
include
essays, novels, poems, tragedies, travel books,
and translations of such classics as Dante's <i>The Divine Comedy</i>
and J.W. von Goethe's <i>Faust</i>. Like his hero, Odysseus,
Kazantzakis lived most of his artistic life outside Greece<font face="Symbol"> - </font>except for the years of World War II. "I am a
mariner of Odysseus with heart of fire but with mind ruthless and
clear," Kazantzakis wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Toda
Raba</span> (1934). Several of the author's novels deal with the
history and culture of his own country, and the mystical relationship
between man and God. In 1957 he lost the Nobel Prize by a single vote
to the French writer <a href="acamus">Albert Camus</a>. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Having seen that I was not capable
of using all my resources in political action, I returned to my
literary activity. There lay the the battlefield suited to my
temperament. I wanted to make my novels the extension of my own
father's struggle for liberty. But gradually, as I kept deepening my
responsibility as a writer, the human problem came to overshadow
political and social questions. All the political, social, and economic
improvements, all the technical progress cannot have any regenerating
significance, so long as our inner life remains as it is at present.
The more the intelligence unveils and violates the secrets of Nature,
he more the danger increases and the heart shrinks." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Nikos Kazantzakis</font></i><font size="2"> by Helen Kazantzakis, 1968) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Nikos Kazantzakis was born in Megalokastro, Ottoman Empire,
now Iráklion, Crete, the son of Michael Kazantzakis, a farmer and
dealer of in animal feed, and his wife, the former Maria
Christodoulzki. Kazantzakis was raised among peasants and although
Kazantzakis left Crete as a young man, he returned to his homeland
constantly in his writings. He attended the Franciscan School of the
Holy Cross, Naxos, and the Gymnasium at Herakleion (1899-1902).
Kazantzakis then studied four years at the University of Athens,
becoming Doctor of Laws in 1906. </p>
      <p>From 1907 to 1909 Kazantzakis studied philosophy in Paris at
the Collège de France under <a href="bergson.htm">Henri Bergson</a>.
His first book,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ophis kai krino</span>, was published in 1906. In the same
year appeared his play <span style="font-style: italic;">Xemeronei</span>. Between the 1910s and 1930s
Kazantzákis wrote dramas, verse and travel books, and travelled widely
in China, Japan, Russia, England, Spain, and other countries.
Restlessly moving on, he came to identify himself with Odysseus,
writing in a poem: "Hail, my soul, whose homeland has always been the
journey." </p>
      <p>Kazantzakis spent many years in public service. In 1919 he was
appointed director general at the Greek Ministry of Public Welfare. By
1927, when Kazantzakis resigned from this post, he had been responsible
for the feeding and eventual rescue of more than 150 000 people of
Greek origin, who had been caught up in the civil war raging in the
Caucasian region of the Soviet Union. Though never a member of the
Communist party, Kazantzakis sympathized leftist movements in the early
phase of his life and was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize later. However,
after three journeys in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, he became
disenchanted with the materialism of the Bolsheviks. The basis of his
own philosophy, which contained elemests from Bergson, Marxism,
Nietzsche, Christianity, and Buddism, Kazantzakis presented in <span style="font-style: italic;">Salvatores Dei</span>  (1927), written in 1922-23 in Berlin. "We come from a
dark abyss, we end in a dark abyss, and we call the luminous interval
life," were his much quoted opening words in the book. </p>
      <p>Kazantzakis's first novel, <i>Toda Raba</i>, was published in
French when he was 51. His vast and rambling epic poem <span style="font-style: italic;">Odysséas</span> (1938)
continued the Homer's tale. Kazantzakis himself considered it his major
achievement, dismissing other works as "spin-offs". Before WW II
Kazantzakis settled on the island of Aegina, and in 1948 he moved to
Antibes, southern France. After the war, he served as a minister in the
Greek government of Aegina. In 1947-48 he worked for UNESCO.
Kazantzákis died of leukemia on October 26, 1957, in Freiburg im
Breisgau, in Germany. Helen Kazantzakis, his wife, tells in the
author's biography that he always had as his traveling companion a
miniature Dante, and Dante alone remained at his bedside until his last
breath. </p>
      <p>Although Kazantzakis published a number of his novels in French,
his most celebrated works were composed in the colloquial language of
the Cretan working classes. <i>Zorba the Greek,</i> his best-known
novel, was written on the island of Aegina, between 1941 and 1943. It
was made into a popular and highly successful movie and inspired the
Broadway musical by Joseph Stein, John Kander, and Fred Ebb. The story
focuses on the relationship of a writer and intellectual, modelled on
Kazantzakis, and an uneducated man, Zorba, who drinks, works, loves and
lives like a force of nature. His character has been seen as the
personification of Henri Bergson's ideas of <i>élan vital</i>. He
doesn't care about books, he values more experience and understanding
than scholarly learning. The narrator meets Alexis Zorba in Pireus. He
plans to reopen on the island of Crete an abandoned mine and Zorba
becomes his foreman. Kazantzakis weaves the narrator's childhood
memories and thoughts against the life and teaching of Zorbas. After a
series of tragedies, failures and small victories, the narrator leaves
Crete, but asks his friend to teach him to dance. "How simple and
frugal a thing is happiness: a glass of wine, a roast chestnut, a
wretched little brazier, the sound of the sea."<font size="2"><b> </b>(from
      </font><i><font size="2">Zorba the Greek</font></i><font size="2">)
      </font></p>
      <p><i>Freedom or Death</i> was based on the Cretan revolt of
1889, one of the final rebellions against Turkish rule. One of the
central characters is Captain Mikalis, who chooses rebellion instead of
love, and dies in the middle of his cry, "Freedom or..." Kazantzakis
shows also understanding of the Turkish culture in the character of
Nuri bei, who commits suicide. <i>The Greek Passion</i> was story
about a group of villagers under Turkish domination, who re-enact the
Passion. <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> explored the theme of
the battle between spirit and flesh. The book was banned by Vatican in
1954 and in 1955 Kazantzakis was excommunicated from the Greek Orthodox
Church. The members of the Orthodox Church of America damned the work
as extremely indecent and atheistic, after admitting that they hadn't
read it and had based their case on the magazine articles. Kazantzakis
presented Christ as an existential hero, a rebel against his divine
mission until he is awakened by Judas, whom he calls his brother. Judas
tries to same in Jerusalem, but his heroic struggle against God ends in
failure. Martin Scorsese's film adaption from 1988 boosted the sale of
the book. <br>
</p>
      <p>Kazantzakis's major work was the enormous poetic work <span style="font-style: italic;">Odyssey: A Modern Sequel</span>, 33 333 lines long, which he wrote seven
times and published in 1938. The poem manifested the
author's deep knowledge of modern archeological and anthropological
discoveries. Some critics accused the author of being too
revolutionary in vocabulary and diction.
Kazantzakis himself emphasized that the work was a synthesis of two
forms of thought, which had created the ancient Greek civilization: the
Apollonian, representing contemplation and order, and the dark
Dionysian underground stream, the expression of the <span style="font-style: italic;">elan vital</span>. "Crete, for me . . . is the synthesis which I always pursue, the synthesis of Greece and the Orient," he said. <br>
