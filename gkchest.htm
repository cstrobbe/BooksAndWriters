<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific English critic and author of verse,
essays, novels, and short stories. Along  with George Bernard Shaw, Hilaire Belloc and   <a href="hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>,
Chesterton was one the great Edwardian men of letters. Between 1900 and
1936 he published some one hundred books. Chesterton also gained fame
for his series about the priest-detective
Father Brown, who appeared in 50 stories</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The </b><b>vast mass of humanity, with
their vast mass of idle books and idle words, have never doubted and
never will doubt that courage is splendid, that fidelity is noble, that
distressed ladies should be rescued, and vanquished enemies spared.
There are a large number of cultivated persons who doubt these maxims
of daily life, just there are a large number of persons who believe
they are the Prince of Wales; and I am told that both classes of people
are entertaining conversationalists."</b> (from 'A Defense of Penny Dreadfuls', 1901) </font></blockquote>

<p>Gilbert Keith Chesterton was born in London into a middle-class
family. Edward, his father, whom Chesterton described as "serene,
humorous and full of hobbies," was a member of the well-known
Kensington auctioneer and estate agents business of Chesterton.
Marie-Louise Grosjean, his mother, was of Franco-Scottish ancestry. Chesterton
did not learn to read until he was over eight, but later he could quote
whole passages of books from memory. One of his teachers told him, "If
we opened your head, we should not find brain but only a lump of white
fat." Chesterton studied at University College, where he registred for
courses in art, Latin, French, and English, and the Slade School of Art
(1893-96), which was an unhappy period in his life. At the age of
sixteen he started a magazine called <i>The Debater</i>. </p>
<p>Around 1893 Chesterton had gone through a crisis of skepticism and
depression. During this period he experimented with the Ouija board and
grew fascinated with diabolism. In 1895 Chesterton left University
College without a degree and worked for the London publisher Redway,
and T. Fisher Unwin (1896-1902). Much of his early writings were first
published in such publications as <i>The Speaker, </i><i>Daily News</i>, <i>Illustrated London News</i>, <i>Eye Witness</i>, <i>New Witness</i>, and in his own <i>G.K.'s Weekly</i>,
which he edited for the last eleven years of his life.
Chesterton renewed his Christian faith; also the courtship of his
future wife, Frances Blogg, whom he married in 1901, pulled him out of
the crisis. Frances was the eldest daughter of a deceased diamond
merchant. She was convicted her husband was ment to be a novelist,
rather than a prolific journalist. </p>
<p>At the start of the twentieth century, Chesterton had formed strong
relationships with a range of writers. His impact on English literature
has been compared to that of Joseph Conrad and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. <span style="font-style: italic;">Greybeards at Play</span>, Chesterton's first collection of poems, appeared in 1900.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Robert Browning </span>(1903) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Charles Dickens</span> (1906) were literary biographies,   <span style="font-style: italic;">The Napoleon of Notting Hill </span>(1904) was Chesterton's first novel, a political fantasy. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Defendant </span>(1901), gathered together from a series essays, which had appeared in<i> Speaker</i>,
caused considerable debate &#8211; Chesterton defended popular culture,
including detective stories, which reviewers had scorned to waste ink
upon them. </p>
<p>Between the years 1890 and 1914 Chesterton produced his most imaginative works, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man Who Was Thursday</span>
(1908), a depiction of fin-de-siècle decadence. The protagonist, Syme,
is a poet turned an employee of Scotland Yard, who reveals a vast
conspiracy against civilization. The members of the secret anarchist
gang are named for days of the week. Sunday is the most mysterious
character who tells that since "the beginning of the world, all men
have hunted me like a wolf &#8211; kings and sages, and poets and law-givers,
all the churches, and all the philosophers. But I have never been
caught yet." Sunday, the president of the Central Anarchist Coucil
gives a simple advice about disguise: "You want a safe disguise, do
you? You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless, a dress in
which no one would ever look for a bomb? Why then, dress up as an <i>anarchist</i>,
you fool! Nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then."
Perhaps Chesterton had in mind the 'Bloody Sunday' of 22 January 1905,
when the priest and double-agent Gapon, led the crowds to the Winter
Palace in St. Petersburgh. A stage adaptation of the story by Mrs Cecil
Chesterton and Ralph Neale was produced in 1926. </p>
<p>In 1909 Chesterton moved with his wife to Beaconsfield, a village
twenty-five miles west of London, and continued to write, lecture, and
travel energetically. Wherever he went, he was recognized. He was six
feet four inches tall, and weighted three hundred pounds. His wife
dressed him in a huge cape and wide-brimmed hat. He also carried a
swordstick. I his youth he had carried a gun and when he heard someone
say that life was not worth living, he would offer to shoot the person,
"and always with the most satisfactory results." <br>
</p>
      <p>Between 1913 and 1914 Chesterton was regular contributor for the <i>Daily Herald</i>. When the First World War
began, he suffered a physical and nervous breakdown. After the war
Chesterton became leader of the Distributist movement and later the
President of the Distributist League, promoting the idea that private
property should be divided into smallest possible freeholds and then
distributed throughout society. In his writings Chesterton also
expressed his distrust of world government and evolutionary progress. <br>
      </p>
      <p>During the Boer War Chesterton took a pro-Boer standpoint. He was very popular
radio lecturer, engaging in a series of debates with<a href="gbshaw.htm"> George Bernard Shaw</a>. His younger brother, Cecil, died in 1918 and Chesterton edited his brother's the <i>New Witness</i> and his own <i>G.K.'s Weekly</i>. The editorial work occupied a considerable amount of his time and energy. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Observed Chesterton on seeing for the
first time the sparkling bright light of Broadway: "How beautiful it
would be for someone who could not read." </b></font> <font size="2">(from <i>The Wordsworth Book of Literary Anecdotes</i>  by Robert Hendrickson, 1990) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1922 Chesterton was converted from Anglicanism to Roman
Catholicism, and thereafter he wrote several theologically oriented
works, including lives of Francis of Assisi and Thomas Aquinas.
"Existence is still a strange thing to me; and as a stranger, I gave it
welcome", he wrote in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Autobiography</span>
(1936). Chesterton received honorary degrees from Edinburgh, Dublin,
and Notre Dame universities. In 1934 he was made Knight Commander with
Star, Order of St. Gregory the Great. Chesterton died on June 14, 1936,
at his home in Beaconsfield. His coffin, too big to be carried down the
staircase, had to be lowered from the window to the ground. Dorothy
Collins, Chesterton's secretary, managed his literary estate until her
death in 1988. </p>


<p>Father Brown debuted in 'The Blue Cross' in the <i>Storyteller</i> (1910). To wider public the character became first known  from Chesterton's book <span style="font-style: italic;">The Innocence of Father Brown&nbsp;</span> (1911), a collection of twelve cases. The rest of the stories appeared in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wisdom of Farher Brown</span> (1914), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Incredulity of Father Brown&nbsp;</span> (1926), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Secret of Father Brown </span>(1927), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Scandal of Father Brown </span>(1935). In <i>Autobiography</i>
Chesterton explained the passive character of his creation: "His
commonplace exterior was meant to contrast with his unsuspected
vigilance and intelligence; and that being so, of course I made his
appearance shabby and shapeless, his face round and expressionless, his
manners clumsy, and so on." Basically these stories can be read as an
attempt to wrestle with the problem of evil. <br>
</p>
      <p>The critic and awarded
mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included Chesterton's <i>The Innocence of Father Brown</i> among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987)</font>.
Before creating father Brown he had hailed in 'Defence of Detective
Stories' this somewhat scorned genre of tales as "the earliest and only
form of popular literature in which is expressed some sense of the
poetry of modern life." Father Brown is gentle, quiet cleric, with
ever-furled umbrella and round face, whose mission is to identify the
culprit so that he/she might repent and save his/her soul. Among his
opponents is the French jewel thief Flambeau, who reforms and becomes a
London private investigator, and helps occasionally Father Brown. "Has
it never struck you," Brown explains to Flambeau in 'The Blue Cross',
"that a man who does next to nothing but hear men's real sins is not
likely to be wholly unaware of human evil?" Father Brown was based on
father John O'Connor (later Monsignor), Chesterton's friend, who in
1922 received the author into the Roman Catholic Church. <font size="2"> </font><a href="jdcarr.htm">John Dickson Carr </a>used Chesterton as the model for his detective Dr. Gideon Fell.<b><font size="2"> </font></b></p>

<p>In his verse
Chesterton was a master of ballad form, as shown in his "Lepanto",
published in 1911. His other works include plays, historical studies,
essays, and biographies of such authors as Robert Louis Stevenson, Leo
Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Robert Browning, Tennyson, Thackeray, George
Bernard Shaw, and William Blake. Chesterton's subjects were very
varied: the biography of Chaucer (1932) celebrated the Middle Ages, <span style="font-style: italic;">Takes a Long Bow</span> (1925) propounded his social and political views, 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Thing</span>
(1929), a collection of essays examined his own conversion to Roman
Catholicism. He wrote quickly and refused to edit his publications
carefully. Religious perspective was the center of much of his
writings. "Personally, I am all for propaganda," he once said, "and a
great dealt of what I write is deliberately propagandist." When the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Illustrated London News</span>
hired him to write a weekly column on all sorts of topics, except
religion and politics, Chesterton responded by saying there was nothing
else worth writing about. <br>
