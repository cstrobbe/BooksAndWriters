<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English author and critic, member
of
Bloomsbury
group and friend of <a href="vwoolf.htm">Virginia Woolf.</a> After
gaining fame as a novelist, Forster spent his 46 remaining years
publishing mainly short stories and non-fiction. Of his five important
novels four appeared before World War I. Forster's major concern was
that individuals should 'connect the prose with the passion' within
themselves, and that one of the most exacting aspect of the novel is
prophecy. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"If human nature does alter it will
be because individuals manage to look at themselves in a new way. Here
and there people - a very few people, but a few novelists are among
them - are trying to do this. Every institution and vested interest in
against such a search: organized religion, the State, the family in its
economic aspect, have nothing to gain, and it is only when outward
prohibitions weaken that it can proceed: history conditions it to that
extent." </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Aspects of the Novel,</font></i><font size="2"> 1927) </font></blockquote>
<p>Edward Morgan Forster was born in London as the son of an
architect, who died before his only child was two years old. Forster's
childhood and much of his adult life was dominated by his mother and
his aunts. The legacy of her paternal great-aunt Marianne Thornton,
descendant of the Clapham Sect of evangelists and reformers, gave later
Forster the freedom to travel and to write. Forster's years at
Tonbridge School as a teenager were difficult &#8211; he suffered from the
cruelty of his classmates. </p>
<p>Forster attended King's College, Cambridge (1897-1901), where
he met members of the later formed Bloomsbury group. In the atmosphere
of skepticism, he became under the influence of Sir Jamer Frazer,
Nathaniel Wedd, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, and G.E. Moore, and shed
his not very deep Christian faith. After graduating he travelled in
Italy and Greece with his mother, and on his return began to write
essays and short stories for the liberal<i> Independent Review</i>.
"Nothing more great will come of me," he wrote in his diary. In
1905 Foster spent several month in German as tutor to the children of
the Countess von Armin. </p>
<p>In the same year appeared his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Where Angels Fear to Tread</span>. In the
following year he lectured on Italian art and history
for the Cambridge Local Lectures Board.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The Longest Journey</span>, then<span style="font-style: italic;"> A Room with a View</span> (1908) was
partly based on the material
from extended holidays in Italy with his mother. The first part of the
novel is set in Florence, where the young Lucy Honeychurch is visitng
with her older cousin Charlotte Bartless. Lucy witnesses a murder and
becomes caught between two man, shallow, conventional Cecil Vyse and
George Emerson, who kisses Lucy during a picnic. The second half of the
novel takes place at Windy Corner, Lucy's home on Summer Street. She
accepts a marriage proposal from Cecil. The Emerson become friends of
the Honeychurches after George, Mr. Beebe, who is a clergyman, and
Freddie, Lucy's brother, are discovered bathing nude in the woods.
Finally Lucy overcomes prejudices and marries George. Forster also
wrote during the pre-war years a number of short stories, which were
collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Celestial Omnibus </span>(1914).
Most of them were symbolic
fantasies or fables. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Howards End</span> (1910)
was a story that centered on an English
country house and dealt with the clash between two families, one
interested in art and literature, the other only in business. The book
brought together the themes of money, business and culture.<b> </b>"To
trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge; the
poor cannot afford it."<font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">Howards
End</font></i><font size="2">) </font>This novel established Forster's
reputation, and he embarked upon a new novel with a homosexual theme, <span style="font-style: italic;">Maurice</span>. The picture of British
attitudes not long after Wilde was
revised several times during his life, and finally published
posthumously in 1971. His personal life Forster hid from public
discussion. Self-doubts plagued him the most in his personal life. "I
shall grow queer and unpopular if I go on as I am now," he said in his
diary. In 1930 he had a relationship with a London policeman. This
important contact continued after the marriage of his London friend.</p>
<p>Between the years 1912 and 1913 Forster travelled in India.
From 1914 to 1915 he worked for the National Gallery in London.
Following the outbreak of World War I, Forster joined the Red Cross and
served in Alexandria, Egypt. There he met the Greek poet <a href="kafavis.htm">C.P. Cavafy</a>, and published a selection of his
poems in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pharaos and Pharillon</span>
(1923). His conversations&nbsp;
with&nbsp; wounded soldiers he recorded in his diary. <br>
</p>
<p>In 1921 Forster returned to
India, working as a private secretary to the Maharajah of Dewas. The
land was the scene of his masterwork <span style="font-style: italic;">A
Passage to India</span> (1924), an
account of India under British rule. It was Forter's last novel &#8211; and
for the remaining 46 years of his life he devoted himself to other
activities. In the novel he said:<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"Most
of life
is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it and the books and
talk that would describe it as interesting are obliged to exaggerate,
in the hope of justifying their own existence. Inside its cocoon of
work or social obligation, the human spirit slumbers for the most part,
registering the distinction between pleasure and pain, but not nearly
as alert as we pretend."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Moreover,
writing about&nbsp; "the love of men for women &amp; vice versa" was
not the most important element in Forster's
life; already in 1910 he stated in his notebook, known as "the Locked
Diary", that he was wary of the subject. </p>
<p>After Forster's
death his literary executors turned down approaches from Joseph Losey,
Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, and Waris Hussein, to make a feature
film adaptation of <span style="font-style: italic;">A Passage
to India</span>, but eventually David Lean was approved as
director. Forster had shared with <a href="telawren.htm">T.E. Lawrence</a>
a dislike of the cinema. (Ironically, today
he would not be as widely known as he is without film adaptations of
his novels.) The two last
chapters of the book<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> Forster
had written under the
influence of Lawrence's <i>The
Seven
Pillars of Wisdom</i>. Later Lean was criticized that he produced
his own vision of India, not Forster's. He also changed the ending of
the story, defending himself: "Look, this novel was written hot on the
movement for Indian independence. I think the end is a lot of hogwash
so far as a movie is concerned." <font size="2"> (in <i>David Lean: A
Biography</i> by Kevin Brownlow, 1996) </font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><font size="2"><b>Passage to India</b></font><font size="2">. Adela Quested visits Chandrapore with Mrs Moore in
order to make up her mind whether to marry the latter's son. Mrs Moore
meets his friend Dr Azis, assistant to the British Civil Surgeon. She
and Adela accept Azis's invitation to visit the mysterious Marabar
Caves. In this trip Mrs Moore nearly faints in the cave and goes mad
for an instant. Adela asks Azis, "Have you one wife or more than one?"
and he is shocked. "But to ask an educated Indian Moslem how many wive
he has &#8211; appalling, hideous!" She believes herself to have been the
victim of a sexual assault by Azis, who is arrested. Adela is pushed
forward by his frieds and family but she admits that she was mistaken.</font><font size="2"> </font><font size="2">"Something that she did not
understand took hold of the girl and pulled her through. Though the
vision was over, and she had returned to the insipidity of the world,
she remembered what she had learnt. Atonement and confession &#8211; they
could wait. It was in hard prosaic tones that she sais: 'I withdraw
everything.'</font><font size="2">"</font><font size="2"> <font size="2"> Mrs Moore dies on the voyage home at sea. "The heat, I
suppose," Mr Hamidullah says. </font>Azis has changed his liberal
views. "We may hate one another, but we hate you most. If I don't make
you go, Ahmed will, Karim will, if it's fifty-hundred years we shall
get rid of you; yes, we shall drive every blasted Englishman into the
sea, and then'&nbsp;</font></font><font size="2"><font size="2"> &#8211;</font></font><font size="2"><font size="2"> he rode against him furiously &#8211; 'and then,'
he
concluded, half kissing him, 'you and I shall be friends.'"&nbsp; The
novel's title derives from Walt Whitman, but the American poet's
celebration of the opening of the Suez Canal as bringing together East
and West is qualified by Kipling's assertion that 'ne'er the twain
shall meet.' The Nobel writer <a href="vnaipaul.htm">V.S. Naipaul</a>
has claimed once that Forster knew hardly anything about India: "He
just knew a few middle-class Indians and the garden boys whom he wished
to seduce." </font></font></blockquote>
<p>Forster wrote literary criticism throughoutn his life. He
contributed reviews and essays to numerous journals,
most notably the <i>Listener</i>, he was an active member of PEN, in
1934 he became the first president of the National Council for Civil
Liberties. Since 1924, Forster lived in the house which his father had
designed at Abinger Hammer, but after his mother's death in 1945, he
was elected an
honorary fellow of King's<em></em> College, Cambridge, and spent there
for the remainder of his
life. In 1949 Forster refused a knighthood and in 1951 he collaborated
with Eric Crozier on the libretto of Benjamin Britten's opera <span style="font-style: italic;">Billy
Budd</span>, which was based on <a href="melville.htm">Herman Melville</a>'s
novel.
Its film version from 1962 was directed Peter Ustinov. Forster was made
a Companion
of
Honour in 1953 and in 1969 he accepted an Order of Merit. Forster died
on June 7, 1970. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"So Two cheers for Democracy: one
because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism."</font></b></blockquote>
<p>Forster often criticized in his books Victorian middle class
attitudes and British colonialism through strong woman characters.
However, Forster's characters were not one-dimensional heroes and
villains, and except his devotion to such values as tolerance and sense
of comedy, he was uncommitted. "For we must admit that flat people are
not in themselves as big achievement as round ones, and also that they
are best when they are comic. A serious or tragic flat character is apt
to be a bore. Each time he enters crying 'Revenge!' or 'My heart bleeds
for humanity!' or whatever his formula is, out hearts sink." <font size="2">(in <i>Aspects
of
the Novel</i>)</font> The epithet 'Fosterian' &#8211; liberal,
unconventional,
sceptical, moral &#8211; had started to circulate since the publication of <i>Howards
End</i>. <br>
</p>
<p>Forster's famous essay 'Two Cheers for Democracy', originally
printed in 1938 in the New York <i>Nation</i>&nbsp;
and entitled also 'What
I Believe', reflected his concern for individual liberty. He assumed
liberal
humanism not dogmatically but ironically, writing in unpompous style
and taking the stand of a mild dissident: "If I had
to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope
I should have the guts to betray my country." <font size="2"> (in 'Two
cheers for
Democracy')</font> <a href="http://www.humanism.org.uk/schools.htm" target="_blank">The British Humanist Association</a> has reissued this
classical work and similar essays. </p>
