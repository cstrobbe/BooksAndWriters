<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Russian journalist, playwright,
novelist, and short story writer, whose major work was the Gogolesque
fantasy <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. In the story the Devil visits
Stalinist Moscow to see if he can do some good. The book is considered
a major Russian novel of the 20th century. It first appeared in a
censored form in the Soviet journal <i>Moskva </i>in 1966-67.
Bulgakov used satire and fantasy also in his other works, among them
the short story collection <i>Diaboliad </i>(1925). </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2">It was hard to say exactly what had
made Bezdomny write as he had--whether it was his great talent for
graphic description or complete ignorance of the subject he was writing
on, but his Jesus had come out, well, completely alive, a Jesus who had
really existed, although admittedly a Jesus who had every possible fault</font><font size="2">." </font></b><font size="2">(from <i>The Master and
Margarita</i>)</font>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Mikhail Bulgakov was born in Kiev, Ukraine, the eldest son
Varvara Mikhaylovna (née Pokrovskaya), a teacher, and Afanasy Ivanovich
Bulgakov, a lecturer at the Kiev Theological Academy. Both of his
grandfathers were priests of the Russian Orthodox Church. Bulgakov's
father died of a kidney ailment in 1907 and his mother married again.
Her second husband, Ivan Pavlovich Voskresensky, was a doctor,
who&nbsp;viewed religion with indifference.&nbsp;Though Bulgakov<span class="st"><span class="ft"> rejected his father's spiritual
world,&nbsp; s</span></span>upernatural&nbsp;and occult attracted him.
Later in his stories he used sudden cuts into the fantastic and in the
late 1920s he studied the Gospels and collected religious works.</p>
      <p>After attending First Kiev High School (1900-09), Bulgakov
studied medicine at the Kiev University (1909-16).&nbsp;
With his first wife,&nbsp; Tatiana Nikolaevna Lappa, who was a
&nbsp;good pianist, he frequently went to the Kiev Opera, where he
heard Goudod's <em>Faust</em> at least ten times. The role of
Mephistopheles was played by&nbsp;the famous Russian opera singer <em></em>Fedor
Shalyapin. Bulgakov himself had a fine, soft baritone, and he played
piano. "The need to listen to music is very characteristic of me," he
once remarked. "One might say that I worship good music.&nbsp;It aids
creativity."&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>From 1916 to 1918&nbsp;Bulgakov served as a doctor in
front-line and district hospitals. "Fate decreed that I should employ
my first-class degree only for a short time," he later wrote in&nbsp;an
autographical piece. While in Viazma he&nbsp;was employed&nbsp;at
the&nbsp;city hospital as the head of the department of infectious and
veneral diseases.&nbsp;His experiences&nbsp;Bulgakov described in notes
of a young doctor, 'Zapiski yunogo vracha' (1925-26). </p>
      <p>During the war years&nbsp; Bulgakov used morphine, but with
the help of his wife,&nbsp;he managed to win the addiction. He worked
in 1918-19 as a doctor in Kiev,&nbsp; witnessing there&nbsp;the German
occupation and then the occupation by the Red Army. In 1920 Bulgakov
abandoned medicine in favor of a career as a writer. He
organized&nbsp;in Vladikavkaz, Caucasus, a 'sub-department of the
arts', and&nbsp;contributed stories to newspapers. One of his tales,
'Morphine,' tells of a young country doctor, Sergey Polyakov,
who&nbsp;turns to morphine to escape his pain of unrequited love, and
eventually&nbsp;commits suicide. The last entry in his diary
is&nbsp;made on February 13, 1918 &#8211; noteworthy, on the&nbsp;following
day the Soviet government decreed the abolition of
the&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Style&nbsp;calendar and its replacement by the New
Style Gregorian calendar. In his own life, Bulgakov left&nbsp;Viazma
for Kiev with his wife&nbsp;in February 1918. </p>
      <p>Bulgakov moved in 1921 to Moscow, where he worked for the
literary department&nbsp;of the People's Commissariat of Education, and
wrote as a journalist for various groups and papers. His largely
autobiographical novel&nbsp;<em>Belaya gvardiya</em> (1925, full text
1973, The White Guard) was an account of the turbulent years between
1914 and 1921 as reflected in the lives of a White family in the
Ukraine. Two parts of the book was published in the journal <i>Rossiya</i>,
which was closed before the third part could appear. Bulgakov abandoned
his plans for a trilogy; the proofs of the new ending surfaced in 1987,
but the final pages were missing. </p>
      <p>With the Moscow Arts Theatre&nbsp;Bulgakov was associated from
1925. He wrote and staged many plays, which enjoyed great popularity.
Bulgakov's criticism of the Soviet system was not swallowed by the
authorities. <i>The Heart of the Dog</i> (written in 1925), a satire
on Soviet life in the guise of science fiction, was condemned
unpublishable. In the story 'Pokhozhdenia Chichikova' the protaginist
of Gogol's <i>Dead Souls</i> was dropped in the middle of the Soviet
Russia's New Economic Policy period of 1921-27. 'Diaboliad'&nbsp;
(1925) portrayed a poor clerk in a gigantic bureaucracy, where he loses
his identity and life. </p>
      <p>In 1928 Bulgakov had three plays running in three Moscow
theatres, <i>Zoya's Apartment</i>, <i>The Crimson Island</i>, and <i>The
Days of the Turbins</i>, dramatized from his novel <i>The White Guard</i>.
It brought the author overnight success and became 'a new <i>Seagull</i>'
for the
new generation, although it also received hostile reviews for the
sympathetic portrayal of White officers. Paradoxically, <i>The White
Guard</i> was one of Stalin's favorite plays. It was banned in 1929,
reinstated in 1932 but not published&nbsp;until 1955. </p>
      <p>From the beginning of&nbsp;1930s Bulgakov's works were
published rarely or not at all&nbsp;&#8211; <i>Zoya's Apartment </i>(1926),
a play set in an atelier-bordello, was banned, as the farce <em>Bagrovy
ostrov</em> (1928, The Crimson Island), a play-within-a-play. One of
its characters asks: "And who are the judges? They're so ancient that
their hostility to freedom is implacable. They cull their opinions from
forgotten newspapers of the Kolchak era and the time of the subjunction
of the Crimea." The German press stated that the play was "the first
call in the USSR for freedom of the press." &nbsp;<i>Flight </i>(1928),
dealing with White fugitives leaving Russia, was banned before its
premiere. In 1929, a watershed&nbsp;in his writing
career,&nbsp;he&nbsp;said in a letter to Maxim Gorky: "All my plays
have been banned; not a line of mine is being printed anywhere; I have
no work ready, and not a kopeck of royalties is coming in from any
source; not a single institution, not a single individual will reply to
my applications..." </p>
      <p>After&nbsp;sending a letter to Soviet government, requesting
permission to emigrate, Bulgakov received a personal telephone call
from Stalin, who apparently offered him the opportunity. As a result,
Bulgakov gave up these plans and for a period he was employed as an
assistant producer with the Moscow Arts Theatre, where he worked until
his resignation in 1936. During the late 1930s he was librettist and
consultant at Bolshoi Theatre. Bulgakov's stage version of Gogol's<i>
Dead Souls</i> premiered in 1932 and had a modest success,&nbsp;but his
play about Pushkin, <em>The Last Days</em>, was first performed in
1943. Although&nbsp; Bulgakov was subjected to a number of restrictions
during his career, he survived attacks from the officials, when other
intellectuals&nbsp;were imprisoned and perished in the 'Gulag
Archipelago.' Bulgakov himself once joked&nbsp;about his relationship
with&nbsp;the General Secretary of the Communist&nbsp;
Party&nbsp;that&nbsp;he wrote him every day long letters, signing them
"Tarzan."&nbsp; However,&nbsp;Stalin's favour protected Bulgakov only
from being arrested, but his&nbsp;fiction remained unpublished.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The translation of <a href="moliere.htm">Molière</a>'s&nbsp;<em>Le
Bourgeois gentilhomme</em>, finished in November 1932, was not accepted
for production.&nbsp;<font color="#666666"> </font><em>Zhizn'
Gospodina de Mol'era</em>, Bulgakov's&nbsp;prose biography of Molière,
which he&nbsp;wrote the Lives of the Great series, was turned down
by&nbsp;the series editor A.A. Tikhonov and Gorky, who said that "its
'playful' style will have to be changed. As it stands now it is not a
serious piece of work. . . ." Bulgakov refused to make any alterations.
The manuscript lay untouched for thirty years until the series
published it in 1962 with an introduction by G. Boyadzhiyev. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>With <i>Black Snow, a Theatrical Novel</i>, Bulgakov took a
revenge on Stanislavsky for the failure of his play <i>A Cabal of
Hypocrites</i>, produced under the title <i>Molière</i>. In one scene
Louis XIV, the Sun King, says: "Then hear this: my author is oppressed.
He is frightened. I will show kindness to anyone who forewarns me of
whatever danger imperils him... The ban is lifted. You may stage <i>Tartuffe</i>."<em>
      </em>Stanislavsky had made changes to the play,&nbsp;and Bulgakov
felt that they utterly destroy his artistic&nbsp;conception.</p>
      <p>Bulgakov's most important&nbsp;novel was <i>The Master and
Margarita</i>, a fantasy about the Devil, disguised as a professor, who
causes havoc in the city. The&nbsp;book was suppressed because
Bulgakov refused to make the changes reguired by the authorities.
Although Bulgakov worked still on the text on his death bed, the novel
was completed.&nbsp;Probably if Stalin had know of the novel it would
have been destroyed. The first Soviet edition was published in 1966-67,
a fuller text appeared in 1973 and the revised full text in 1989.</p>
      <blockquote><i>The Master and Margarita </i>(1928-40). Published
in installments in 1966 and 1967 in the journal <i>Moskva</i>.
The&nbsp;story takes place on three levels, each of which provides a
commentary on the others. Historical narrative is set in Jerusalem,
where Pontius Pilate condemns to death a man, Jeshua, whom he knows to
be innocent.
Contemporary narrative is set in Moscow, in the 1930s, where the Master
and Margarita live and where the Master has written a novel about
Pilate. The third, fantastic level introduces the devil, who steps out
of Goethe's <i>Faust. </i>He appears in Moscow with a retinue that
includes an enormous black cat. The devil, Woland, is unconventionally
seen as a relatively sympathetic figure, Righteous Man in Sodom.
Moreover, the character of Jesus, called Yeshua, in not very Biblical.
The philosophical and religious themes and examination of the freedom
of art circulate around the intrusion of the devil into the life of
modern Moscow and the crucifixion of Christ. Interacting and competing
discourses from the realms of science, religion, literature, history,
and politics, complicate further the narrative. Master burns his
manuscript and retires to a madhouse. Margarita's love for the master
drives her to a pact with Satan. However, "manuscripts don't burn" and
Woland defends the existence of Jeshua. <i>
        </i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Bulgakov composed two versions of the work. One was
written at home and another, when he did not have the original
available, was born while he was living with a mistress. Much of the
the satire is aimed at greed, vanity, and pettiness, but is possible to
read the book as a tribute to Stalin's policy to cut the bourgeois
elements of Soviet society. After the publication Bulgakov was seen as
a link between such writers as Vasilii Aksenov, Andrei Siniavskii, and
the Strugatskii brothers, and the great past tradition of Gogol and
Dostoevskii. </blockquote>
      <p>Bulgakov was married three times: with Tatiana Nikolaevna
Lappa (1913), Liubov Evgenevna Belozerskaia (1924), whose first husband
was the feuilletonist Vasil'evsky ('Ne-Bukva'), and&nbsp;Yelena
Sergeyevna Shilovskaya (1932), who gave invaluable support to the
author when he worked&nbsp;on&nbsp;<i>The Master and Margarita</i> and
had his fits of paranoia. Bulgakov died of a hereditary disease in
Moscow on March 10, 1940. After his death&nbsp;he was considered for
decades an outsider and the most "un-Soviet" author. Yelena kept the
existence of <em>The Master and Margarita</em> a close secret and
eventually fulfilled her vow to have it published, but it&nbsp;was not
until the 1980s, when&nbsp;all of&nbsp; Bulgakov's&nbsp;stories could
be printed in his own home country. </p>
