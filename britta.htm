<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>


<p>British pacifist, feminist, poet, and novelist. Brittain's novels are largely autobiographical. 
Her best-known work is <span style="font-style: italic;">Testament of Youth&nbsp;</span> (1933), a story of 'the lost generation'  and the irrevocable 
changes in her life caused by World War I. Its has been sometimes compared to 
<a href="rgraves.htm">Robert Graves</a>'s more bitter autobiography <i>Goodbye to All That </i>(1929) 
&#8211; both are personal farewells to the past and the England they knew. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Testament of Friendship&nbsp;</span> (1940) Brittain  
told about her close friendship with the writer 
<a href="holtby.htm">Winifred Holtby</a>, who died in 1935. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"We had quite a gay bridge at the
Whiteheads' this afternoon. I was most rash and doubled all I could and
went "no trumps" on both possible &amp; impossible hands, but just
missed the prime. I finished <i>Felix Holt</i> after dinner. How
George Eliot's books do inspire me; they make all good seem worthwhile.
How I long to be such a character as Felix Holt, to have no regard for
failure, to hold an ideal for humanity high enough to be forever
leading further onward &amp; yet applicable to the smallest things of
life! How I yearn to follow pure and heavenly aspiration, without the
alloy of a desire for self-glory or of personal ambition, to heal some
little part of the sore burdens of mankind."</b> (Brittain in her diary in 1913, from </font><i><font size="2">Phoenix</font></i><font size="2">, 2000) </font></blockquote>
<p>Vera Brittain was born at Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, the
daughter of Thomas Brittain, a wealthy paper manufacturer, and Edith
Bervon. Her childhood years Brittain spend in Macclesfield with her
brother Edward who was less than two years her junior. She was educated
at St Monica's School. After completing her final term, she returned to
her parents' home in Buxton, Derbyshire. To escape the Northern
provinces and her sheltered life, she wanted to continue her studies at
Somerville College, Oxford. Her father first rejected the idea, but
eventually her parents gave up their opposition. Thomas Brittain, who
had suffered from depression for many years, drowned himself in 1935. <br>
</p>
<p>"When the Great War broke out, it came to me not as superlative tragedy," wrote Brittain in <i>Testament of Youth</i>,
"but as an interruption of the most exasperating kind to my personal
plans." Brittain left Somerville temporarily and served as a Voluntary
Aid Detachment nurse. Her fiancé, Roland Leighton, was killed by a
sniper's bullet in 1915. "Nothing in the papers, not the most vivid and
heartbreaking descriptions, have made me realize war like your
letters," she had written to Leighton shortly after she arrived on the
Western Front. She also lost her younger brother Edward, who died in
1918 on the Italian Front, and two close friends, Geoffrey Thurlow and
Victor Nicholson. Their moving correspondence, <span style="font-style: italic;">Letters from a Lost Generation</span>, came out in 1999. <br>
</p>
      <p>As a VAD nurse, Brittain had first hand experience of women's
changing role in society. She worked in hospitals in Malta and near the
Western Front, nursing English soldiers and German prisoners, and
witnessing the consequences of modern combat. These experiences turned
Brittain into a convicted pacifist, and an active member of peace
movements in both England and the United States. </p>

<p>After the war she returned to her studies at Oxford with a
strenghtend commitment to feminism. Before moving to London in 1922,
where she devoting herself to writing, Brittain worked for a period as
a teacher. Between the years 1921 and 1925 she travelled extensively in
Europe. Her journeys included visits to the Rhineland, the Ruhr, and
Cologne, during the post-war occupation of Germany. In 1925 Brittain
married the political scientist George C.G. Catlin (1896-1979), who was
later appointed professor of politics at Cornell University and
knighted in 1970. Soon after their marriage they went to the United
States and lived for a year in Ithaca, New York. </p>
<p>While George Caitlin lived in the United States, working at Cornell, Brittain remained in England. 
She developed a close friendship with the novelist and ardent feminist Winifred Holtby (1898-1935), 
whom she had met in 1919 at Somerville College in Oxford. 
Holtby had served during World War I in the Women's Army 
Auxiliary Corps. After 
completing their studies,  they settled in 1922 in a flat 
in London as aspiring writers. Neither of two women regarded 
their relationship as lesbian; Brittain's vision of 
sexual relations was traditional. However, when she married Catlin, 
Holtby continued to live with the couple. 

Holtby's novel<i> Anderby Wold</i> appeared in 1923. Her final novel, <i>South Riding</i> (1936), was set in Yorkshire, and told the story of an enterprising headmistress Sarah Burton. </p>
<p>Basically Brittain believed, that all writing should be based on the writer's life. Her first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dark Tide</span> (1923) was an account of life in Oxford and the sexism she encountered
there, and her early struggles as a woman to achieve an education. The
central characters, Virginia Dennison and Daphne Lethbridge, were the
thinly veiled Vera Brittain and Winifred Holtby. It provoked a storm of
protests in Oxford, where the dons believed it would bring bad
publicity for the college. Her wartime experiences and marriage to
George Caitlin were recounted in <i>Testament of Youth</i>. The book was based on her diary, which she began in 1913, and which was published in 2000 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Phoenix: Chronicle of Youth</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Testament of Youth</span> was an immediate bestseller and has gained the status of an important feminist text. </p>
<p>Brittain joined the Peace Pledge Union of Canon Dick Sheppard, and
also fought for peace during World War II. Against the dominating
climate of opinion, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Seed of Chaos </span>(1944)
she fearlessly attacked the saturation bombing of Germany. The book was
rejected unanimously both in England and America. </p>
<p>Although Brittain wrote after her autobiography several volumes of poetry and fiction, she is perhaps best remembered for <i>Testament of Friendship </i>(1940), a memorial to Winifred Holtby, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Testament of Experience&nbsp;</span> (1957), a companion to the early autobiography, which covers the years 1925-50. Her other books include <span style="font-style: italic;">Born1925</span>, a family saga dealing with the responses of two generations to World War II, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lady into Woman: A History of Women from Victoria to Elizabeth II</span> (1953), <span style="font-style: italic;">Radclyffe Hall:a Case of Obscenity?</span> (1968), which defended Hall's lesbian novel <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>. Brittain's diaries between 1913 and 1917 were published under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Chronicle of Youth </span>(1981).</p>
<p>Vera Brittain was an Honorary Life President of the Society of Women
Writers and Journalists, a vice-president of the National Peace
Council, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She died in
London on March 29, 1970. During her final illness, she wrote a
pencilled note, "I loved Winifred, but I was not in love with her."
Brittain's daughter, Shirley Williams, was a
prominent Labour Party politician and cabinet minister in 1960. She
co-founded the Social Democratic Party in 1981 and served as its
president in 1982-88.</p>
