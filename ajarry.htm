<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French writer known mainly as the
creator of <em>Ubu Roi</em>, first produced by Aurélien Lugné-Poë in
Paris in 1896. Jarry was a forerunner of the Theatre of Absurd (see <a href="../../../beckett.htm">Beckett</a>, <a href="../../../ionesco.htm">Ionesco</a>, <a href="../../../pirandel.htm">Pirandello</a>, Genet and others),
writing his works in a Surrealistic style, and inventing a
pseudoscience or "science of imaginary solutions" which he called <i>'pataphysique.</i> It is a concept that eludes definition. Jarry once stated: "Laughter is born out of the discovery of the
contradictory." Jarry's other works include stories, novels, and poems.

      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>De ceux qu'ont transis les

        <font size="2">(in 'Pastorale') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Alfred Jarry was born in Laval, Mayenne, into a well-to-do
farmer and craftsman family. He was the second child of Anselme Jarry,
a cloth merchant, and his wife Caroline, née Quernest. Jarry was
educated in the schools of Saint-Brieuc and Rennes. At the age of 18 he
moved to Paris to live on a small family inheritance, and pursue his
studies at the Lycée Henri IV. In collaboration with his classmates at
the Lycée of Rennes, he had written<i> Ubu roi</i> to ridicule a
pompous and fat mathematics teacher, Monsieur Hébert; by the students
he was mocked as Père Heb, Éb, Ébouille, Ébé, P.H. an so on. Originally
'Pére Heb' was the star of plays presented with marionettes. After
settling in Paris Jarry continued to polish the Ubu saga and also wrote
two sequels,<em> Ubu Enchaîné</em> (1900), which was acted for the
first time at the Paris Exposition of 1937, and<em><strong> </strong></em><span class="st"><em>Ubu Cocu</em> </span>(1944), in which Père Ubu flushes
his conscience down the toilet. Scatalogical humor always appealed to
Jarry, who dismissed the conventional use of language.</p>
      <p>When <i>Ubu roi</i><i><b> </b></i>was first presented on
December 10, 1896 at the Théâtre de l'Oeuvre, the coarseness of the
language and anarchistic tones were too much for the audience, which
rose in outrage after the first word, which was "Merdre!" The play
shocked even W.B. Yeats, who attended its opening night. One reviewer
said: "Despite the late hour, I have just taken a shower. An absolutely
essential preventive measure when one has been subjected to such a
spectacle." The title character, cowardly Père Ubu is egged on by his
wife to murder the royal family. He becomes the king of Poland and
establishes a reign of terror. (PEASANTS. Mercy, Lord Ubu, have pity on
us. We are poor, simple people. PA UBU. I couldn't care less.)
Eventually he is defeated by the Tsar and forced into exile to France
with Mother Ubu. The events take place in a crazy never-never land,
tempo is rapid, and principal characters move through the story like
some monstrous puppets on an attack on existing moral and aesthetic
values.&nbsp;In addition to satirizing bourgeois values, Jarry sneers
at traditional drama, among others Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i> in
scene in which Mère and Père Ubu plot to assassinate the King of
Poland. </p>
      <p>After five months of military service in 1895, Jarry was
discharged for medical reasons. He then began to frequent literary
salons and devoted himself to writing. Jarry's first book was <em>Les
Minutes de Sable Mémorial</em>&nbsp; (1894), a collection of prose and
verse. It was followed by <em>César-Antéchrist</em> (1895), widely
regarded as an unperformable play.&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>L'amour
absolu</em><strong> </strong></span>(1899) was a novel, more obscure
than anything he had produced. <a href="../../../hgwells.htm">H.G.
Wells</a>'s novel <i>The Time Machine </i>inspired Jarry to write the
speculative essay 'How to Construct a Time Machine' (1900). <span class="st"><em>Le Surmâle </em></span>(1902, The Supermale) was
Jarry's last novel. "The act of love is of no importance, since it can
be performed indefinitely," states Jarry in the beginning of the book.
The hero of the erotic fantasy is a superman who wins a bicycle race
against a six-man team, he has sex 82 times with a women, and
experiences the final climax with an amorous machine. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Yet it is high time we perceive
the remarkably clear line that connects the impish figure of Alfred
Jarry in 1896, calmly saying <i>merde</i> (shit) to bourgeois culture,
with Albert Camus, the impassioned humanist who wanted to bring all the
black sheep back into the fold."</b> (Maurice Nadeau in <i>The History
of Surrealism</i>, 1968) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After his fortune was soon spent, and Jarry lapsed into a
chaotic, Bohemian life. However, he lived and died a virgin, and
although he hated christianity, he felt compelled to seek God on his
deathbed. A nihilist, he declared: "We won't have destroyed anything
unless we destroy the ruins too". Though physically tiny, his presence
in turn-of-the-century Paris was huge. </p>
      <p>Jarry had taste for absinthe, he lived in a bizarre apartment
where each store had been cut horizontally in half to make double the
original number of floors. André Gide put Jarry into an episode of his
novel <i>The Counterfeiters</i>. In 1926 Gide wrote: "Everything in
Jarry, that strange humbug, smelled of affectation &#8211; his face whited
with flour, his mechanical speech without intonation, the syllables
evenly spaced, and the words made up or distorted." </p>
      <p>Until his death at the age of thirty-four, Jarry was a
familiar figure stalking the streets of Paris with his green umbrella,
symbol in <i>King Ubu</i> of middle-class power, and wearing the
cyclist's garb and carrying two pistols. According to an anecdote, once
he was asked for a light in the street and discharged a pistol shot (<i>un
feu</i>). From <i>Ubu </i>he also adopted the gestures of his
creation, spoke in high falsetto like Ubu, and always employed the
royal "we." </p>
      <p>Henri Rousseau, a minor inspector in the toll service and the
first of the so-called naive painters, painted Jarry's portrait which
was hung in the Salon des Indépendants. With his healt ruined&nbsp; by
poverty, tuberculosis, and alcohol,&nbsp;Jarry died&nbsp;at the Hôpital
de la Charité,&nbsp;Paris, on November 1, 1907.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was
buried in the Bagneux cemetery. A volume of Jarry's essays came out in
1911 but it was not until the 1920s, when the value of his work was
widely recognized. </p>
      <p>Jarry's writings had a profound influence on the surrealist
and Dada movements. With Picasso, whom he once gave a Browning
automatic, he shared interest in masks. His absurd humor appealed to <a href="../../../abreton.htm">André Breton </a>(1896-1966) and <a href="../../../duchamp.htm">Marcel Duchamp</a> (1887-1968), who stated
that the Dada spirit was the "non-conformist spirit of every century
that has existed since man is man". Jarry's influence on modern science
fiction is seen is J.G. Ballard's <i>The Assassination of John
Fitzgerald Kennedy as a Downhill Motor Race</i> (1967), which echoes
Jarry's themes from his essay <i>Commentair pour servir à la
construction pratique de la machine à explorer le temps. </i></p>
      <p><i>'Pataphysics</i> &#8211; the initial apostrophe was deliberate &#8211;
mixed science, science fiction, technology and art. Jarry defined it as
the science of imaginary solutions, "which will examine the laws
governing exceptions, and will explain the universe supplementary to
this one." The 'science' was later taken up and developed by other
French novelists such as Boris Vian, George Perec and <a href="../../../quene.htm">Raymond Queneau</a>.
At the first performance of Ubu Roi, Jarry referred to the "double
aspect" philosophy of Gustav Theodor Fechner, who argued in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">Elemente der Psychophysik</span> (1860) that there is a mathematically demonstrable relationship between physical and psychical events. <br>
</p>
      <p>Paul McCartney paid
homage to Jarry's branch of metaphysics in his Beatles song <i>Maxwell's
Silver Hammer</i> from 1969. With Barry Miles, a bookseller, he had
talked about the "pataphysical society and the Chair of Applied
Alcoholism, and wrote in the song: "'Joan was quizzical, studied
pataphysical science in home...'" In 1995 McCartney made for the
American network Westwood One a radio series called <i>Oobu Joobu</i>,
which was inspired by Jarry's character Père Ubu. </p>
