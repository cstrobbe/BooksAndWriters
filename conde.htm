      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Guadeloupean author of epic
fiction,
best-known for her historical novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Ségou</span> (1984-85, Segu; The Children
of Segu). Condé's
multifaceted novels question stereotypical images of literary
characters, colonialism, sex and gender. She has also published
children's
books, a booklet about Guadeloupe, book-length essays about
francophone women writers and oral literatures in Martinique and
Guadeloupe, critical booklets about Aimé Césaire's <i>Cahier
d'un retour au pays natal</i>, Antillean fiction, and numerous
articles mainly about Caribbean literature and cultural studies.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"She was a young woman who was
pretty in an odd way. Her lovely blond hair hidden under a sombre hood
fuzzed up and formed a luminous halo around her head. She was wrapped
in shawls and blankets as though she were shivering despite the warm,
stuffy air in the cabin. She smiled at me and in a voice as pleasant as
the waters of the River Ormond she said: so you're Tituba? How cruel it
must be to be separated from your own family. From your father, your
mother, and your people.'" </b>(from<i> I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem</i>,
1986) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Maryse Condé was born in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, a small
French/Creole-speaking Caribbean island. She was the youngest of eight
children. Condé's mother was a schoolteacher, and her father ran a
small savings and loan company, called Caisse Coopérative des Prêts,
which he had founded with his friends. When Condé was eight, she wrote
a one-act play dedicated to her mother. However, both of her parents
died before she became known as a writer. Condé never knew her maternal
grandmother, an illiterate mulatto born on the island of Marie-Galante,
but reconstructed her life in <span style="font-style: italic;">Victoire, les saveurs et les mots</span>
(2006, Victoire: My Mother's Mother), a family story about mothers and
daughters. </p>
      <p>Condé left Guadeloupe at the age of sixteen, when she was sent
by her parents to Paris. She was educated at Lycée Fénéleon and
Sorbonne, majoring in English. "Being so far from my parents had a very
sad side to it", she later recalled, "but I think that's when I
discovered loths of things like the cinema, art, museums, and
exhibitions." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Conversations
with Maryse Condé</font></i><font size="2">, by Maryse Condé and
Françoise Pfaff, 1996)</font> During her time as a student, she joined
the Communist Youth. In 1958 she married Mamadou Condé, a Guinean
actor; officially they divorced in 1981. Before following her husband
to Guinea, where he was appointed director of the National Ballet,
Condé had a teaching appointment in the Ivory Coast at the junior high
school in Bingerville.
She continued as an instructor Conakry, Guinea, but upon the breakup of
her marriage &#8211; she was not granted a divorce &#8211; she went with her
children to Ghana, where she taught French at the Institute of Language
in Accra (1966-68). Condé also published an anthology of
French-language African literature. With the fall of Kwame Nkrumah, he
was expelled from the country. For a period she lived in Senegal, where
she was first employed as a translator for IDEP (Institute for
Development and Promotion).
      </p>
      <p>Condé's African years were restless. "I know now just how
badly prepared I was to encounter Africa", Condé acknowledged later, "I
had a very romantic vision, and I just wasn't prepared, either
politically or socially." <font size="2">(<i>World Authors 1980-1985</i>,
ed. Vineta Colby, 1991)</font> Condé lived in Ghana and Senegal during
the turbulent moments of history of these countries. She met such
political figures as Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of Ghana, António
Agostinho Neto, a famous Angolan nationalist leader, Amilcar Cabral, a
Guinea-Bissaunian guerrilla and politician, and attended gatherings
that included Malcolm X and Ernesto "Che" Guevara as speakers. This
wandering period also was fruitful for her creative development. She
has argued that too much familiarity with a place does not allow an
author to write about it more truthfully but only to 'mythify' it.
While in Senegal, she also met Richard Philcox, and Englishman who
taught at the high school where she worked and who later became her
husband. </p>
      <p>Settling eventually with her family in London, she worked for
the BBC as a program producer for two years (1968-70), and then taught
at Jussieau (1970-72) and Nanterre (1972-80). In 1975 Condé recived her
Ph.D. Her dissertation in comparative literature dealt with black
stereotypes in Caribbean literature. Between
the years 1980 and 1985, Condé was a course director at Sorbonne.
Scholarly fellowships and invitations to teach brought her then to the
United States.</p>
      <p>In the 1970s she wrote several plays, which were performed in
Paris and in the West Indies. Her first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hérémakhonon</span> (1976), went practically unnoticed in France, but interested
French teachers in the United States, who invited her to lecture on
Francophone literature. "I spoke very poor English at the time, which
turned out to be not very important because the students were mainly
concerned with suntans and surfing." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Conversations with Maryse Condé</font></i><font size="2">, by Maryse Condé and Françoise Pfaff, 1996)</font> The story
told of a young black West Indian woman, Veronica, who is educated in
Paris and searches her roots in Africa. In Paris she had a white lover,
and in Africa she becomes the mistress of the Minister of Defence, who
turns out to be thoroughly corrupt. The theme continued in the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Une saison à Rihata</span> (1981, A Season in Rihata), where Condé's African
and Caribbean characters are lost in a corrupt country. Also in this
work the protagonist is a Guadeloupian woman. However, Condé had denied
that Veronica was an autobiographical character. </p>
      <p>Condé's novels are set at cultural intersection, exploring the
intrusion of European imperialism into Africa and the resulting
diaspora cultures, particularly that of the West Indies. In her early
works the author explored the myth that the rediscovery of African
ancestry can solve the Caribbean question. Later Condé has focused on
West Indian net of past myths, contemporary corruption, and
disillusionment about the possibility to erase a colonial past of
dispossession. </p>
      <p>Condé's two-part historical novel <i>Ségou</i>, became a
best-seller and made him a major contemporary Caribbean writer. Set in
the African kingdom of Ségou (now part of Mali), it traces the history
of the royal Traore family in its encounter with slave trade, Islam,
Christianity, and French colonialism from between 1797 and 1860. The
work follows the fates of four royal sons to Brazil and the Caribbean
using unknown historical documents <font face="Symbol">-</font>
ethnographical notes, genealogies, maps <font face="Symbol">-</font>
and personal narratives. </p>
      <p>
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Moi, Tituba, sorcière noire de Salem</span> (1986 I, Tituba, Black Witch of
Salem), written as an autobiographical transcription of a forgotten
witch of Salem, and <span style="font-style: italic;">La Migration des c&#339;urs</span> (1995, Winward Heights)
Condé has reinterpreted stories and historical events that have became
a part of Western cultural heritage. Tituba, the daughter of a
Barbadian slave woman, was arrested in Massachusetts in the village of
Salem along with the white girls in the witch trials of 1692, which
also inspired <a href="amiller.htm">Arthur Miller</a>'s famous play <i>The
Crucible </i>(1953). She was released from jail, but there is not much
records of what happened to her afterwards. Condé adds to what little
is known about her life, creating her a fictional childhood as an
orphan in Barbados. There she is initiated into another, benign, kind
of witchcraft, brought from Africa by an old woman, Mama Yaya, before
being sold to the family who bring her to Salem. In Puritan New England
her talent is considered a threat to society. </p>
      <p><i>Winward Heights</i> transposed <a href="ebronte.htm">Emily
Brontë</a>'s wild love affair from <i>Wuthering Heights</i> to a
Caribbean context and set the story against reincarnation cult. This
experiment in intertextuality has been considered Condé's finest
achievement to date. Heathcliff appears as Razye and Cathy's daughter
suffers the consequences of her mother's choices. Noteworthy, Charlotte
Brontë's<i> Jane Eyre</i> inspired <a href="rhys.htm">Jean Rhys</a>'s
best known novel <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> (1966), which gave voice to
Edward Rochester's mad wife, Bertha Mason. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">La Colonie du nouveau monde</span> (1993) ends with disillusionment.
It presented a mock version of the colonial enterprise. Trying to
overcome their alienation, a couple from Guadeloupe <font face="Symbol">-</font>
who met in psychiatric institution in France <font face="Symbol">-</font>
stage a return to the place 'before things went wrong,' i.e. Egypt.
Finally their sad journey ends in Columbia. <span style="font-style: italic;">Desirada</span> (1997, Desirada)
dealt again seach of the past, truth and lies, and spans three
generations and three countries <font face="Symbol">-</font>
Guadeloupe, France and America. </p>
      <p>After a 30-year absence, Condé returned in 1986 to Guadeloupe. <span style="font-style: italic;">La vie scélérate</span> (1987, The Tree of Life), about wandering and
homecoming, was her first novel set in her native country. From the
1990s, she has divided her time between Guadeloupe and the US. She has
taught at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of
Virginia, the University of Maryland, Harvard, and the University of
Columbia. After retiring from teaching in 2004, she continued to
lecture and write. Her home she maintained on her native island.
Condé's husband, Richard Philcox, has translated many of her works into
English. Condé has received several awards, including the Prix
Liberatur (Germany) for <i>Segu</i>, the Grand Prix Littéraire de la
Femme for <i>I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem</i>, the Prix Carbet de
la Caraïbe for <i>Desirada</i>, the Prix Marguerite Yourcenar for <span style="font-style: italic;">Le C&#339;ur à rire et à pleurer</span> (1999, Tales from the Heart: True Stories
from my Childhood), and Le Grand Prix du roman métis for <span style="font-style: italic;">En attendant la montée des eaux</span> (2010). In 2001 she was ordained Commandeur dans
l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres de la France and 2004 she was made
Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur. </p>
