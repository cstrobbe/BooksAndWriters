<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English playwright who achieved
international success as one of the most complex post-World War II
dramatists. Harold Pinter's plays are noted for their use of silence to
increase tension, understatement, and cryptic small talk. Equally
recognizable are the 'Pinteresque' themes &#8211; nameless menace, erotic
fantasy, obsession and jealousy, family hatred and mental disturbance.
In 2005, Pinter was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I don't know how music can influence
writing, but it has been very important for me, both jazz and classical
music. I feel a sense of music continually in writing, which is a
different matter from having been influenced by it."</b> (Harold Pinter in </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights at Work</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by George Plimpton, 2000) </font></blockquote>
<p>Harold Pinter was born in Hackney, a working-class neighborhood in
London's East End, the son of a tailor. Both of his parents were
Jewish, born in England. As a child Pinter got on well with his mother,
but he didn&#8217;t get on well with his father, who was a strong
disciplinarian. On the outbreak of World War II Pinter was evacuated
from the city to Cornwall; to be wrenched from his parents was a
traumatic event for Pinter. He lived with 26 other boys in a castle on
the coast. At the age of 14, he returned to London. "The condition of
being bombed has never left me," Pinter later said. </p>
<p>Pinter was educated at Hackney Downs Grammar School, where he acted
in school productions. At school one of Pinter's main intellectual
interests was English literature, particularly poetry. He also read
works of Franz Kafka and Ernest Hemingway. </p>
<p>After two unhappy years Pinter left his studies at London's Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1949 Pinter was fined by magistrates for
having, as a conscientious objector, refused to do his national
service. Pinter had two trials. "I could have gone to prison &#8211; I took
my toothbrush to the trials &#8211; but it so happened that the magistrate
was slightly sympathetic, so I was fined instead, thirty pounds in all.
Perhaps I'll be called up again in the next war, but I won't go." <font size="2">(from P</font><i><font size="2">laywrights at Work</font></i><font size="2">) </font>Pinter's father paid the fine in the end, a substantial sum of money. 
</p>
<p>In 1950 Pinter started to publish poems in <i>Poetry</i> (London) under the name Harold Pinta. He worked as a bit-part actor on a BBC Radio program,<i> Focus on Football Pools</i>.
He also studied for a short time at the Central School of Speech and
Drama and toured Ireland from 1951 to 1952 with a Shakespearean troupe.
In 1953 he appeared during Donald Wolfit's 1953 season at the King's
Theatre in Hammersmith. </p>
<p>After four more years in provincial repertory theatre under the
pseudonym David Baron, Pinter began to write for the stage.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">The Room</span> (1957), originally written for Bristol University's drama department, was finished in four days.<span style="font-style: italic;"> A Slight Ache</span>, Pinter's first radio piece, was broadcast on the BBC in 1959. His first full-length play, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Birthday Party</span>,
was first performed by Bristol University's drama department in 1957
and produced in 1958 in the West End. The play, which closed with
disastrous reviews after one week, dealt in a Kafkaesque manner with an
apparently ordinary man who is threatened by strangers for an unknown
reason. He tries to run away but is tracked down. Although most
reviewers were hostile, Pinter produced in rapid succession the body of
work which made him the master of 'the comedy of menace.' "I find
critics on the whole a pretty unnecessary bunch of people", Pinter said
decades later in an interview. "We don't need critics to tell the
audiences what to think." </p>

<p>Pinter's major plays originate often from a single, powerful visual
image. They are usually set in a single room, whose occupants are
threatened by forces or people whose precise intentions neither the
characters nor the audience can define. The struggle for survival or
identity dominates the action of his characters. Language is not only
used as a means of communication but as a weapon. Beneth the words,
there is a silence of fear, rage and domination, fear of intimacy. </p>
<p>"Pinter's dialogue is as tightly &#8211; perhaps more tightly &#8211; controlled than verse," Martin Esslin writes in <i>The People Wound </i>(1970).
"Every syllable, every inflection, the succession of long and short
sounds, words and sentences, is calculated to nicety. And precisely the
repetitiousness, the discontinuity, the circularity of ordinary
vernacular speech are here used as formal elements with which the poet
can compose his linguistic ballet." Pinter refuses to provide rational
justifications for action, but offers existential glimpses of bizarre
or terrible moments in people's lives. </p>

<p>In 1960 Pinter wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dumb Waiter</span>. With his second full-length play, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Caretaker</span> (1960), Pinter made his breakthrough as a major modern talent, although in Düsseldorf the play was booed.  <i>The Caretaker</i> was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">The Collection</span> (1962), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dwarfs </span>(1963), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lover</span> (1963). </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Homecoming</span> (1965) is
perhaps the most enigmatic of all Pinter's early works. It won a Tony
Award, the Whitbread Anglo-American Theater Award, and the New York
Drama Critics' Circle Award. In the story an estranged son, Teddy,
brings his wife Ruth home to London to meet his family, his father Max,
a nagging, aggressive ex-butcher, and other tough members of the
all-male household. At the end Teddy returns alone to his university
job in America. Ruth stays as a mother or whore to his family. Everyone
needs her. Similar motifs &#8211; the battle for domination in a sexual
context &#8211; recur in <i>Landscape</i> and <i>Silence</i> (both 1969), and in <i>Old Times</i> (1971), in which the key line is "Normal, what's normal?"  After <i>The Homecoming</i>
Pinter said that he "couldn't any longer stay in the room with this
bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out." </p>
<p>Several of Pinter's plays were originally written for British radio
or TV. In the 1960s he also directed several of his dramas. After <span style="font-style: italic;">Betrayal</span> (1978) Pinter wrote no new full-length plays until <span style="font-style: italic;">Moonlight </span>(1994). Short plays include<span style="font-style: italic;"> A Kind of Alaska</span> (1982), inspired by the case histories in Oliver Sack's<i> Awakenings</i> (1973). </p>
<p>From the 1970s Pinter has directed a number of stage plays and the American Film Theatre production of <i>Butler</i> (1974). In 1977 he published a screenplay based on Marcel Proust's <i>A la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i>.
Closely associated with the director Peter Hall, he became an associate
director of the National Theatre after Hall was nominated as the
successor of Sir Lawrence Olivier. Pinter has received many awards,
including the Berlin Film Festival Silver Bear in 1963, BAFTA awards in
1965 and in 1971, the Hamburg Shakespeare Prize in 1970, the Cannes
Film Festival Palme d'Or in 1971, and the Commonwealth Award in 1981.
He was awarded a CBE in 1966, but he later turned down John Major's
offer of a knighthood. In 1996 he was given the Laurence Olivier Award
for a lifetime's achievement in the theatre. In 2002 he was made a
Companion of Honour for services to literature. </p>
<p>Pinter was married from 1956 to the actress Vivien Merchant. For a time, they lived in Notting Hill 
Gate in a slum. Eventually Pinter managed to borrow some money and move away. Although Pinter said in an 
interview in 1966, that he never has written any part for any actor, his wife Vivien frequently appeared 
in his plays. After his first marriage dissolved in 1980, Pinter married the biographer Lady Antonia 
Fraser, whose former husband was the ­Conservative MP Hugh Fraser.  
The divorce separated Pinter from his son Daniel, a writer and musician. Vivien Merchant died in 1982. 

Antonia Fraser's account of her married life with Pinter, <i>Must You Go?</i> came out in 2010. </p>
<p>Pinter work include a number of screenplays, including<i> The Servant</i> (1963),<i> The Accident </i>(1967), <i>The Go-Between</i> (1971), <i>The Last Tycoon </i>(1974, dir. by Elia Kazan), <i>The French Lieutenant's Woman</i> (1981, novel by <a href="jfowles.htm">John Fowles</a>), <i>Betrayal </i>(1982), <i>Turtle Diary</i> (1985), <i>Reunion</i> (1989), <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> (1990), <i>The Comfort of Strangers</i> (1990), and <i>The Trial </i>by Franz Kafka (1990). In the 1990s Pinter became more active as a director than as a playwright. He oversaw David Mamet's <i>Oleanna</i> and several works by Simon Gray. </p>
<p>Since the overthrow of Chile's President Allende in 1973, Pinter was active in human rights issues. 
      <a href="rushdie.htm">Salman Rushdie</a>, who had been "sentenced
to death" by Ayatollah Khomeini, was asked to deliver the annual
Herbert Read Lecture in 1990. Because he was living with the threat of
murder, the lecture, entitled 'Is Nothing Sacred,' was read by
Rushdie's friend Pinter. Rushdie argued that in an open society no
ideas, texts, even people could be ring-fenced and&nbsp; given the
immunity from challenges of all sorts. The lecture was televised on the
BBC<span style="font-style: italic;"> Late Show</span>.  The first Muslim responses were negative. <br>
</p>
      <p>Pinter's opinions were often controversial. During the Kosovo crisis in 1999, Pinter condemned Nato's intervention, and said it will "only aggravate 
the misery and the horror and devastate the country". In 2001 Pinter joined The International Committee 
to Defend Slobodan Milosevic, which also included former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark. Milosevic was 
arrested by the U.N. war crimes tribunal. In January 2002 Pinter was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus. 
In his speech to an anti-war meeting at the House of Commons in November 2002 Pinter joined the world-wide 
debate over the so-called "preventive war" against Iraq: "Bush has said: "We will not 
allow the world's worst weapons to remain in the hands of the world's worst leaders." Quite right. 
Look in the mirror chum. That's you." In February 2005 Pinter announced in an interview that he has 
decided to abandon his career as a playwright and put all his energy into politics. "I've written 29 plays. 
Isn't that enough?" Harold Pinted died on December 24, 2008, in London. </p>
