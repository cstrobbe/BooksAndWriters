      </blockquote>
      <p>Constantine P. Cavafy was born Konstantinos Petrou Kavafis (or
Kabaphs) in Alexandria, Egypt, into a wealthy merchant family.
Originally the family came from Constantinople, Turkey, where Cavafy
lived from 1880 to 1885. His father, Peter John Cavafy, married the
poet's mother Haricleia (1835-1899) in 1849. She was the daughter of a
diamond merchant. </p>
      <p>After his father's death in 1872, Cavafy was taken to
Liverpool, England, for five years. Apart from the years in Istanbul
(1882-85), he spent the rest of his life in Alexandria. "Whatever
war-damage it's suffered, / however much smaller it's become, / it's
still a wonderful city," Cavafy once wrote of his cosmopolitan home
town &#8211; perhaps not without ironic attitude. Of the ancient Greek city
nothing survived the conquering Arabs. </p>
      <p>Alexandria's Arabic heritage did not affect noteworthy
Cavafy's work, which essentially cherished the Greek world of Alexander
the Great and his followers, the old, lost civilised world beyond which
lived only "barbarians". "What is shocking about Cavafy's writing is
the absence of Mediterranean or eastern imagery," wrote Marguerite
Yourcenar. "He was cut off from the Arabic and Islamic world, and his
eastern side is suspended." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The
Atlas of Literature, </font></i><font size="2">1996)</font></p>
      <p>In his famous poem, 'Waiting for the Barbarians', Cavafy
commented the role which the arrival of the new rulers was supposedly
to have: "And now what shall become of us without any barbarians? /
Those people were some kind of solution." The deliberately flat ending
parallels with T.S. Eliot's last words in 'The Hollow Men' (1925):
"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper." </p>
      <p>When the family's prosperity declined, Cavafy worked 34 years
intermittently as journalist, broker, and in the Irrigation Service,
from which he retired in 1922. Enjoying his
family's respectable position in the lively society of Alexandria,
Cavafy led an uneventful life of routine, which was interrupted only by
short trips to Athens, France, England, and Italy. His first book was
published when he was 41, and reissued five years later with additional
seven poems. He published no further works during his lifetime. His
homosexual activities Cavafy had to hide, but he had lovers and he
visited most likely the bisexual brothels. </p>
      <p>Cavafy started his career under the influence of
late-Victorian and Decadent European models, but then abandoned
attempts to compose poetry in foreign tongues. As a writer Cavafy was
perfectionist &#8211; he printed his poems by himself and delivered them only
to close friends. The poems had sometimes handwritten corrections. Main
themes were fate, the conflict between high ideals and reality,
homosexual love, art, and politics. Among his confessional poems with
homosexual theme is 'The Bandaged Shoulder', written in 1919, much
admired by <a href="/durrell.htm">Lawrence Durrell</a>. "When he left,
I found, in front of his chair, / a bloody rag, part of the dressing, /
a rag to be thrown straight into the garbage; / and I put it to my lips
/ and kept it there a long while &#8211; / the blood of love against my
lips." </p>
      <p>Fourteen of Cavafy's poems were published in a pamphlet in
1904. The edition was enlarged in 1910. Several dozens appeared
subsequent years in a number of privately printed booklets and
broadsheets. These editions contained mostly the same poems, first
arranged thematically, and then chronologically. Close to one third of
his poems were never printed in any form while he lived. 'One Night,'
written 1907, was one of the erotic poems Cavafy wrote during the years
in Alexandria, and referred to a passing sexual encounter, a memory of
sensual pleasures: </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>And there on that common, humble
bed, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">I had love's body, hand those intoxicating lips,
        </font><br>
        <font size="2">red and sensual, </font><br>
        <font size="2">red lips of such intoxication </font><br>
        <font size="2">that now as I write, after so many years, </font><br>
        <font size="2">in my lonely house, I'm drunk with passion
again. </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>In book form Cavafy's poems were first published without dates
before World War II and reprinted in 1949.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Poi&#275;mata</span> (The Poems of Constantine
P. Cavafy), edited by Rika Sengopoulou, appeared posthumously in 1935
in Alexandria. Cavafy died on
April 29, 1933 in Alexandria. Nowadays the cafés that the poet
frequented on the Rue Misalla (now Safiya Zaghlul) have been largely
replaced by shops.</p>
      <p>Cavafy composed rhymed as well as free verse, but never loose,
unstructured, or irregular poems. He used iambic, eleven-syllable
measures, including the popular fifteen-syllable verse of the demotic
tradition. After giving up experiments with different literary models,
Cavafy mixed the demotic and pure Greek called <i>katharevousa</i>,
and used his wide knowledge of the history of East Roman and Byzantine
empires as the basis of his themes. In 'The God Abandon's Anthony' he
utilized Shakespeare's play <i>Anthony and Cleopatra </i>and
Plutarch's <i>Life of Anthony</i> to describe sense of loss through
the fictive voice of an unknown person, who addresses Mark Anthony: </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As one long prepared, and graced
with courage, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">as it right for you who were given this kind of
city, </font><br>
        <font size="2">go firmly to the window </font><br>
        <font size="2">and listen with deep emotion, but not </font><br>
        <font size="2">with the whining, the pleas of a coward; </font><br>
        <font size="2">listen &#8211; your final delectation &#8211; to the voices,
        </font><br>
        <font size="2">to the exquisite music of that strange
procession, </font><br>
        <font size="2">and say goodbye to her, to the Alexandria you
are losing." </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>Like in Oscar Wilde, aestheticism and skepticism marked
Cavafy's work. One of his central motifs was regret for old age: "You
will not find other places, you will not find other seas. / The city
will follow you. All roads you walk / will be these roads. And you will
age in these same neighborhoods; and in these same houses you will go
gray." (from 'The City') Past and present, East and West, Greek and
'barbarian' were fused into sophisticated commentaries on paganism,
Christianity, and decadent modern world, but he did not write
nostalgically of the past. Cavafy sketched a rich gallery of
historical, semiobscure, or fictitious characters, whom he used as
personae acting, or being discussed, in the episodes of his poems.
Sometimes his style is dramatic, as in the 'Waiting for the
Barbarians,' composed in 1898, and printed in 1904. The South-African
writer J.M. Coetzee borrowed its title for his novel from 1980.
Generally, Cavafy's tone is restrained, that of an impartial observer
of history and human nature. </p>
      <p>Cavafy's poems have been translated into English, French,
Italian, and German, and several other languages, among other into
Finnish. The 1963 Nobel laureate <a href="/seferis.htm">George Seferis</a>
was his ardent admirer, and E.M. Forster persuaded <a href="/tseliot.htm">T.S. Eliot</a> to publish several Cavafy's lyrics
in <i>The Criterion</i> in 1924. A selection of Cavafy's poems was
also published in <a href="/forster.htm">E.M. Forster</a> 's <i>Pharos
and Pharillon</i> (1923). Cavafy became known as the 'poet of the city'
from the many references in <a href="/durrell.htm">Lawrence
Durrell'</a>s <i>Alexandria Quartet. </i>The English novelist <a href="/jfowles.htm">John Fowles</a> once remarked that Cavafy is for
him the great poet of the Levant. </p>
