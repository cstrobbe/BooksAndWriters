      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Albanian writer, frequently
mentioned as a
candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, a leading figure of
Albanian cultural life from the 1960s. During the terror of the Hoxha
regime, Kadaré disclosed the true character of totalitarian rule and
doctrines of socialist realism with subtle allegories, although as a
committed Marxist he officially supported the liberation of Albania
from its backward past. Since 1990 Kadaré has lived in France. Kadaré's
best-known works include <i>The General of the Dead Army</i> (1963),
about an Italian general who is immersed in his absurd and gruesome
mission in Albania. He never realizes that spiritually he is as dead as
the fallen soldiers of past wars. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The bodies of tens of thousands of
soldiers buried beneath the earth had been waiting so many long years
for his arrival, and now he was here at last, like a new Messiah,
copiously provided with maps, with lists, with the infallible
directions that would enable him to draw them up of the mud and restore
them to their families. Other generals had led those interminable
columns of soldiers into defeat and destruction. But he, he had come to
wrest back from oblivion and death the few that remained. He was going
to speed on from graveyard to graveyard, searching every field of
battle in this country to recover those who had vanished. And in his
campaign against the mud he would suffer no reverses; because at his
back he had the magic power conferred by statistical exactitude."</b>
(from </font><i><font size="2">The General of the Dead Army</font></i><font size="2">) </font> </blockquote>
      <p>Ismail Kadaré was born in the museum-city of Gjirokastra, in
southern Albania. His father worked in the civil service. Kadare grew
up during the years of World War II, witnessing the occupation of his
home country by fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union. He
attended primary and secondary schools in Gjirokastra, and went on to
study languages and literature at the Faculty of History and Philology
of the University of Tirana. In 1956 Kadaré received a teacher's
diploma. He also studied at the Gorky Institute of World Literature in
Moscow. </p>
      <p>In 1961 Albania broke with the Soviet Union, and finally with
all other Socialist countries, including China. From the cultural
standstill arose a new generation of writers, among them Kadaré, Fatos
Arapi, and Dritëro Agolli, who was for many years head of the Albanian
Union of Writers, although his work was occasionally felt to be out of
touch with the party line. In Albania Kadaré first won fame as a poet
at the same time when writers hostile to Hoxha suffered persecution.
Kadare's attitude to the Hoxha regime was ambiguous. His first novel, <i>Gjenerali
i ushtrisë së vdekur</i> (1963, The General of the Dead Army), is a
study of postwar Albania and begins in a pouring rain. </p>
      <p>The general of the title is on a mission to Albania, years
after the occupation and war, to dig up and repatriate the bones of his
fellow soldiers, who had died in the country during World War II. "I
have a whole army of dead men under my command," he realizes bitterly.
Before completing his work, the general suffers a nervous breakdown in
a wedding feast. <i>Dasma</i> (1968, The Wedding) was well received in
Albania. The heroine of the novel, a young peasant girl, is rescued
from a traditional arranged marriage by factory work. She meets and
marries a man she loves, thus breaking the traditions. </p>
      <p>Kadaré served as a delegate to the People's Assembly in 1970
and he was given freedom to travel and to publish abroad. Kadaré's <i>Chronicle
in Stone </i>(1971) was praised by John Updike in <i>The New Yorker </i>as
"sophisticated and accomplished in its poetic prose and narrative
deftness". In <i>Kështjella</i> (1970, The Castle), a story of
Albania's struggle against the Ottoman Turks, and <i>Ura me tri harqe</i>
(1978, The Three-Arched The Bridge), an account of the events
surrounding the construction of a bridge across a river, Kadaré
depicted the feudal Albania. After offending the authorities with 'The
Red Pashas' (1975), a politically satirical poem, he was subjected a
self-criticism session at the Writers' Union and forbidden to publish
for three years. Kadaré has admitted that <i>The Great Winter</i>
(1977), which flattered Enver Hoxha, was written in an attempt to avoid
confrontation with the authorities. </p>
      <p>In <i>Broken April </i>(1978), a story about the blood feud,
Kadaré returned to one of his favorite themes &#8211; how the past affects
the present, this time exemplified by the unwritten law of <i>Kanun</i>.
Acting upon the eye-for-eye principle, Gjorg Berisha avenges the murder
of his brother, but in so doing he also seals his own fate. "Gjorg came
out of the concealment and walked towards the body. The road was
deserted. The only sound was the sound of his own footsteps. The dead
man had fallen in a heap. Gjorg bent down and laid his hand on the
man's shoulder, as if to wake him. 'What am I doing?' he said to
himself. He gripped the dead man's shoulder again, as if he wanted to
bring him back to life. 'Why am I doing this?' he thought." </p>
      <p>Kadare's major themes include the historical experience of the
Balkan peoples, the Communist experiment in Albania, and the
representations of the classical myths in modern contexts. <i>Nënpunësi
i pallatit të ëndrrave</i> (1981, The Palace of Dreams) was a political
allegory of totalitarianism, set in an Ottoman capital. The central
character is a young man, Mark-Alem, whose job is to select, sort, and
interpret the dreams of the imperial populace in order to discover the
"master-dream" that will predict the overthrow of the rulers. This
basically humorous novel for others than the Albanian authorities was
almost immediately banned after its publication. In 1982 Kadaré was
accused by the president of the League of Albanian Writers and Artists
of deliberately evading politics by cloaking much of his fiction in
history and folklore. </p>
      <p> Hoxha died in 1985, and his successor, Ramiz Ali, was a less
powerful figure. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Successor</span>
(2003), a thriller, was loosely based on the suspected suicide of
Mehmet Shehu, who was long regarded as Hoxha's right-hand man. Kadaré
plays with the complex relationship between the Designated Successor,
living in a constant fear of a political error, and the dictator
(called the Guide in the novel), who can't
trust anyone. At the novel's end the Successor himself reveals in his
interior monologue, what really happened on the night of his death.
"The events of this novel draw on the infinite well of human memory,"
Kadaré wrote in the beginning, "whose treasures may be brought to the
surface in any period, including our own." <br>
      </p>
      <p>A few months before the collapse of the communist regime,
Kadaré emigrated to Paris where he has lived with his family ever
since. In 2005 Kadaré was awarded the Man Booker International Prize.
Several of Kadare's books have been adapted to the screen. <i>Broken
April </i>has been filmed three times. A film version of <i>The
General of the Dead Army</i>, entitled <i>Il generale dell'armata morte</i>
(1983), was made in Italy, starring Marcello Mastroianni as General
Ariosto. Shirin Neshath, who won the Silver Lion for Best Director at
the Venice Film Festival in 2009, has optioned <i>The Palace of Dreams</i>
for her second film. </p>
      <p>Kadare's <i>Koncert në fund të dimrit</i> (1988, The Concert)
was considered the best novel of the year 1991 by the French literary
magazine <i>Lire</i>. The story is laid against Albania's break with
China. In exile Kadaré has expressed his disappointment and bitterness.
      <i>La Pyramide</i> (1992), written in French, was set in Egypt in
the twenty-sixth century B.C. and after. Kadaré mocked Hoxha's fondness
for elaborate statutes, the pyramid form also reflecting any dictators
love for hierarchy. <i>The Accident</i> (2010) was a multilayered
novel about two lovers, whose death launches an investigation not only
of their relationship, but also of Balkan politics.</p>
