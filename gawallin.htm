      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Finnish explorer,
orientalist,
teacher and professor at the University of Helsinki, best-known for his
journeys in Arabia in the 1840s. Wallin's adventurous life in the East
inspired Z. Topelius to write a poem about him and his contemporary
Finnish explorer, M.A. Castrén: </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Jo kauas pohjolan piirin taa </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Castrénin polku katoaa; </font><br>
        <font size="2">lakaissut tuuli aavikon </font><br>
        <font size="2">Wallinin jäljet on. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(translated into Finnish by Otto Manninen) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Georg August Wallin was born in the parish of Sund in Åland,
the son of a district registrar. He entered the University of Helsinki
in 1829, where he studied oriental languages, and received his M.A. in
1836. He then worked as a librarian at Helsinki University Library and
continued his studies of Arabic and Persian. His teacher was Gabriel
Geitlin, who was seven years his senior and had been appointed in 1835
professor of oriental languages. </p>
      <p>After making his dissertation about Arabic in 1839, Wallin
spent two years in St. Petersburg. There his teacher was Sheikh
Muhammad SAyyad al-Tantawi (1810-61), whose tales of Egypt and the
Arabs inspired the young scholar. Between 1843 and 1849 he conducted
expeditions in Egypt, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Persia. It is
also believed that Wallin adopted the Islamic faith, although his
writings often reveal more or less skeptic view of religious practices.
In Cairo he learned to play the Arab flute, spent a lot of time at
coffee houses, ate with bare hands, and wrote to Geitlin: "What becomes
of my appearance, and because of my real Arab beard, I am considered
Oriental and Moslem..."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Wallin did not
live in celibate. Cairo and Paris offered him more opportunities for
erotic adventures than Helsinki, which he fully utilized. He also
recorded his affairs with Egyptian teenage girls in his writings. In
Finland Wallin was labelled more as adventurer than a scholar and his
scientific achievements were first ignored. </p>
      <p>On his journeys Wallin, who was exceptionally dark for a Finn,
presented himself as Abd al-Wali from Central Asia. He was the first
European to reach al-Jauf and Ha'il. With the help of his disguise and
knowledge of language, Wallin visited in 1845 Mecca &#8211; a forbidden city
for non-Moslems. However, he did not describe his stay very thoroughly.
Originally Wallin did not plan to see the town but had to go there by
force of circumstances. In December 1846 Wallin started his second
journey to the pilgrimage sites in the Holy Land. On his last
expedition Wallin travelled via Taima and Tabuk to Bagdad and Persia.
However, he did not visit the ruins of Persepolis on his way from
Isfahan to Shiraz. </p>
      <p>Wallin spent on his expedition over five year. On his journey
through Europe he stayed a short time in Cologne. In the evening he
went to hear Beethoven's Fidelio; the performance brought tears to his
eyes. Wallin returned to Helsinki via London, where he published some
of his studies, and was awarded with the gold medal of Royal
Geographical Society in 1850. His study, <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes Taken During a Journey Through Part of Northern Arabia in 1848</span>, was published next year by the Royal
Geographical Society. Wallin was the first scholar to collect Bedouin
poetry, his views on Arabic phonetics were highly valued by other
researchers. However, most of his notes and letters Wallin wrote in
Swedish, and his observations were not spread widely in the English
speaking world. </p>
      <p>In 1851 Wallin presented his doctoral thesis, <span style="font-style: italic;">Carmen elegiacum Ibnu-l-Faridi cum commentario Abdu-l-Ghanyi</span>, and he was appointed
professor of oriental literature. Wallin continued to arrange his
research material, but his voyages to the Arabic lands were over. When
the British and Russian geographical societies asked him to start a two
years' expedition, Wallin rejected the offer because according to his
plans, a new journey would take at least six years. And he did not like
the idea that he should return through the Central Asia, which the
Russians considered an obligatory part of the project. Wallin died on
October 23, 1852, three years after his return to Finland. According to
some speculations, he died of syphilis, which was not the official
cause of death &#8211; he died of heart failure. Wallin contracted it
possibly in Paris, where he was beaten and robbed, or most likely in
Cairo. During his journeys Wallin bought 34 books and 19 manuscripts
for Helsinki University Library, but they were not catalogued for over
a hundred years. Wallin's portrait was painted by R.W. Ekman in 1853.</p>
      <p>G.A. Wallin was among the first Westerners to enter the holy
Islamic places and his adventures created similar legend around him as <a href="telawren.htm">T.E. Lawrence</a>'s (Lawrence of Arabia) acquired
through activities in Near East. However, Wallin's interest in Arabia
was more influenced by 'Drang nach Osten' movement, which romanticized
the Bedouin culture, than curiosity about the forbidden towns. He
considered European culture oppressive, and this feeling only
strengthened during the years he spent in Arabia as an romantic,
nomadic adventurer, and fulfilling the dreams of exotic escapism. On
his return he wrote: "I felt, that couldn't adapt myself to Europe any
more"<font size="2"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></font><font size="3">&#8211;</font>
he was ready to turn back and spend the rest of his life in the Orient.
