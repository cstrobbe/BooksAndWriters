<p>One of the most creative and prolific Chinese novelists and
short-story writers, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 2012. Mo Yan mixes in his work fantastical flights of
imagination with historical and contemporary issues. His best known
works include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Garlic Ballads</span>
(1989), banned for a period in China following the Tiananmen Square
uprising, <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Red
Sorghum</span> (1995), adapted to screen by Zhang Yimou, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out</span>
(2006), about a village landlord, who is executed and reincarnated as a
donkey, an ox, a pig, a dog, a monkey and a boy. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I had learned to love Northeast
Gaomi
Township with all my heart, and to hate it with unbridled fury&nbsp; I
didn't realize until I'd grown up that Northeast Gaomi Township is
easily to most beautiful and most repulsive, most unusual and most
common, most sacred and most corrupt, most heroic and most bastardly,
hardest-drinking and hardest-loving place in the world .&nbsp; .&nbsp;
."</b> </font><font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> Red Shorgum</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Mo Yan was born in Gaomi, Shandong province, into a large
family of
thirty-one members. His father, who had completed four years of
education, worked as an accountant until his retirement in 1982. Mo
Yan's mother was an illiterate housewife. She gave birth to more than
half a dozen children, only four of whom survived. "We all lived
together in
five big rooms," Mo Yan has recalled. "My uncle and aunt and their
three children&nbsp; lived in one, my parents and four of my brothers
and sisters lived in another, and my grandparents and other close
relatives lived in the other three. Now when I look back I don't know
how we managed to survive." <br>
</p>
<p>In the years of the "Great Leap
Forward," a famine swept through the country. The experience of hunger
became a significant motif in Mo Yan's writing. He has told that in his
childhood his stomach became so swollen
and transparent, that he could see the
green vegetables inside his intestines after eating a vegetable soup.
During the Cultural Revolution, Mo Yan was not allowed to
continue his education due to his class origin, and he went to work in
the fields and at a factory. In 1976, Mo Yan enlisted in the People's
Liberation Army (PLA), which provided a way out of hunger and hard
labor. <br>
</p>
<p>Mo Yan married in 1979; his wife and children stayed in Gaomi
County, but he had no permanent residency registration there and he
lived in a dormitory in the Department of Defense. While in the army,
Mo Yan worked as a librarian, taught in a&nbsp; literacy campaing, and
wrote in his free time at night. His oldest brother, who was a teacher
and first discouraged his younger brother from his writing fiction,
turned to support him. Mo Yan's first short story, 'Chunye yu feifei'
(The incessant rain on a spring night) appeared in 1981 in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lian chi</span>, a literary
journal. From
1984
to 1986 Mo Yan studied literature at the PLA Art Institute. Following
the publication of several novellas and short stories, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Hong gao liang</span>, he joined in 1986
the Chinese Association of Writers. In
1988 he was admitted to a master's program at the Beijing Lu Xun
Literary Institute.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mo Yan is associated with the authors known as "root-seekers,"
who were not satisfied with realistic representations of rural life,
but sought inspiration from Latin American magic realism. The movement
reached its height of popularity in the 1980s. Mo Yan has acknowledged
his debt to <a href="marquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a>, whose <span style="font-style: italic;">One Hundred Years of Solitude</span> was
translated into Chinese in 1984, but he has also said he felt he
already possessed what Márquez had. However, while writing<span style="font-style: italic;"> Red Sorghum</span>
he tried hard to get away from the influence. "Come to think of it, if
Marquez had not existed, a Chinese Marquez would have emerged." <font size="-1">(Mo Yan in </font><font size="2"><font size="-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Morning Sun: Interviews with Chinese
Writers of the Lost Generation</span> by Laifong Leung, 1994, pp.
150-51) </font></font><a href="luxun">Lu Xun</a>'s tradition of
cultural and social criticism and <a href="faulkner">William Faulkner</a>&#8217;s
fictional Mississippi county of Yoknapatawpha have also inspired Mo
Yan's work. "His Yoknapatawpha
County showed me that a writer could not only fabricate his characters
and his stories, but could make up a geological locale as well." <font size="-1">(Mo Yan in </font><font size="-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">A Subversive Voice in China: The Fictional
World of Mo Yan </span>by Shelley W. Chan, 2010) </font>&nbsp;<font size="2"> </font></p>
<p>Until <span style="font-style: italic;">Red Sorghum</span>,
Mo
Yan was largely unknown outside circles of Beijing's literati. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Set
during the Sino-Japanese war in Mo Yan's hometown, Gaomi
County, the story
portrays three generations of a Chinese family in times of brutality.
The traditional linear historical narrative approach is abandoned and
the
first-person point of view moves freely in time and space. Reviewing
the novel for the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times
Books Review</span>, Wilborn Hampton concluded that "Mo Yan introduces
Western readers to the unfamiliar culture
of provincial China through dozens of vivid characters -- like Five
Monkeys Shan, Spotted Neck, Pocky Leng and Nine Dreams Cao. By the end,
they and Mo Yan have put Northeast Gaomi Township securely on the map
of world literature." <font size="-1">(<span style="font-style: italic;">The New York Times Book Review</span>,
April 18, 1993) </font>Zhang Yimou's&nbsp; film based on the book won
a
prize in&nbsp; the Golden Bear Awards at the Berlin Film Festival in
1988. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Garlic Ballads</span>,
originally published by the People's Liberation Army Publishing House,
was set in mythical Paradise Country, where practically nothing has
changed. At the suggestion of the government, the peasant
began to grow garlic, but a bumper harvest leads to disastrous events.
Shortly after its publication, the novel was banned, most likely
because of Mo Yan's sympathetic representation of an antigovernment
riot by
peasants. Later the book appeared&nbsp; in a "revised" edition. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sheng si pi lao&nbsp;</span>
(Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out), a parody of official narratives,
told of a former landlord
executed for his "bourgeois sins" during land reform in 1950. He goes
through a series of reincarnations from a donkey to monkey and is
eventually reborn as a human child. The hallucinatory satire <span style="font-style: italic;">Jiu guo</span> (1992, The
Republic of Wine) poked fun at the Chinese obsession with banqueting.
With his description of Rabelaisian drinking and feasting, Mo Yan
paints a grotesque a picture of a country that definitely has moved on
from the years of famine. One of the characters is a middle-aged writer
named Mo Yan, who visits the fictional province of Liquorland
as a guest of honor, and after rounds of toasts he slides under the
table. The work
was not published in China until after a Taiwanese edition came in
1992.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Feng
ru fei tun</span>
(1995, Big Breasts and Wide Hips), a celebration of
the female, stirred some controversy due to its sexual content, and the
book was withdrawn from sale. Though Mo Yan has pushed the boundaries
of free artistic expression in China, he has also argued that
limitations or
censorship is great for literature creation. His novels are widely
available in Chinese bookstores, and besides the Nobel Prize, he has
received virtually every major Chinese literary award. His works have
been
translated into many other languages, including French, German,
Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. <br>
