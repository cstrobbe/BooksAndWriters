<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->One of the greatest American playwrights,
restless and bold experimenter, winner of the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1936. O'Neill's best-known works include <i>Anna Christine </i>(pub. 1922), <i>Desire Under the Elms</i>  (pub.1924), <i>Mourning Becomes Electra </i>(pub. 1931), <i>Long Day's Journey Into Night</i>  (pub. 1956), and <i>The Iceman Cometh</i>
(prod. 1946). His 45 plays range in style from satire to tragedy. They
often depict people who have no hope of controlling their destinies. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There's little choice between the
philosophy you learned from Broadway loafers, and the one Edmund got
from his books. They're both rotten to the core. You've both flouted
the faith you were born and brought up in &#8211; the one true faith of the
Catholic Church &#8211; and your denial has brought nothing but
self-destruction." </b>(Tyrone in <i>Long Day's Journey Into Night</i>)</font></blockquote>
<p>Eugene Gladstone O'Neill was born in a Manhattan hotel into an
Irish-Catholic theatrical family, the son of James O'Neill and Mary
Ellen "Ella" Quinlan. His early life was restless: his father, who was
an actor, spent most of his career touring in the lead role of the
popular melodrama The Count of Monte Cristo. The family lived mainly in
hotels. Their seaside cottage in New London, Connecticut, became later
the setting for <i>Long Day's Journey Into Night</i>. In 1895 O'Neill
was enrolled in the St. Aloysius Academy for Boys, and transferred in
1900 to the DeLa Salle Institute in Manhattan. During these years his
mother's addiction to morphine left profound emotional scars on the
growing O'Neill. He also found out that his own birth had precipitated
her addiction. In 1902 Ella tried to drown herself after running out of
morphine. At the age of 63, she spent several months at a convent,
where the nuns helped cure her. </p>
<p>O'Neill renounced Catholic Church in his teens. After attending the
Betts Academy in Stamford, a non-sectarian preparatory school, he
entered Princeton University, but left it after a year, and just spent
much of his time in New York waterfront bars and brothels, supporting
himself by working at odd jobs, as a gold prospector, a sailor, an
actor, and a reporter. In 1909 O'Neill married Kathleen Jenkins. The
marriage ended two years later; at that time she was carrying their
son, Eugene Jr. O'Neill went to sea in 1910, living the life of a tramp
at docksides. Once he attempted suicide, overdosing in a flophouse. He
stayed with his family in Connecticut, but was then forced by the onset
of tuberculosis to spend six months in a sanatorium. After recovering
O'Neill began writing plays. He was enrolled in George Pierce Baker's
47A Workshop at Harvard University (1914-1915), and then joined the
Provincetown Players.</p>
<p>"<i>The Hairy Ape</i> was propaganda in the sense that it was a
symbol of a man, who has lost his old harmony with nature, the harmony
which he used to have as an animal and has not yet acquired in a
spiritual way. Thus, not being able to find it on earth nor in heaven.
he's in the middle, trying to make peace, taking the "woist punches
from bot' of 'em." ... The subject here is the same ancient one that
always was and always will be the one subject for drama, and that is
man and his struggle with his own fate. The struggle used to be with
the gods, but is now with himself, his own past, his attempt "to
belong." <font size="2">(Eugene O'Neill in </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights on Playwriting</font></i><font size="2">, ed.  Toby Cole, 1961) </font></p>
<p>In the late 1910s O'Neill dramas begun to gain recognition in New
York. In 1918 he married the writer Agnes Boulton; they had two
children. O'Neill's father died in 1921 from cancer, next year he lost
his mother, and twelve months after that his brother Jamie, who
suffered from alcoholism, died from a stroke. Eugene Jr. commited
suicide in 1950, at the age of forty, by slitting his wrists and left
ankle with a straight razor in his country cottage in Woodstock.
Between the years 1918 and 1924 O'Neill wrote <i>Anna Christie</i>, finished in less than six weeks, <i>The Emperor Jones</i>, finished in about two weeks, <i>The First Man</i>, <i>The Hairy Ape</i>, <i>The Fountain</i>, and <i>Welded</i>. Nearly all his plays dealt either directly or indirectly with death, loss, and mourning.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>During the early 1920s O'Neill formed with Robert Edmond Jones and
Kenneth Macgowan, a gifted producer, a "Triumvirate" that ran the
Experimental Theater at the Provincetown Playhouse. While still married
to Agnes, O'Neill used the help of his friend Macgowan to send roses to
the beautiful actress Carlotta Monterey. O'Neill's second marriage
ended in 1929. In the same year he married Carlotta Monterey, with whom
he first settled in France, then in Sea Island, Georgia, and finally in
California. O'Neill saw his children infrequently. He disinherited his
son Shane because he did not approve of his son's life style, and his
daughter Oona, because at the age of eighteen she married Charles
Chaplin, who was fifty-four. Oona was his fourth wife. The couple
settled down in Vevey, Switzerland; Chaplin had eight children with
her. O'Neill never met his grandchildren. </p>
<p>The Pulitzer winning <i>Beyond the Horizon</i> (pub. 1920) was
O'Neill's first important play. The story depicts two brothers, Andrew,
the elder a practical realist, and the younger, Robert, a poetic
idealist. Robert is incapable of managing the family farm. When Andrew
returns from a long voyage, successful and wealthy, he finds Robert
dying of tuberculosis. On his deathbed, Robert still dreams of freedom
beyond the horizon. After H.L. Mencken's criticism of<i> Welded</i>
(1924) O'Neill wrote to the critic George Jean Nathan: "Damn that word,
'realism!' When I first spoke to you of the play as a 'last word in
realism,' I meant something 'really real,' in the sense of being
spiritually true, not meticulously life-like." <font size="2">(in S</font><i><font size="2">elected Letters of Eugene O'Neill</font></i><font size="2">, edited by Travis Bogard and Jackson R. Bryer, 1988) </font></p>
<p><i>Mourning Becomes Electra</i>, based on Aeschylus's <i>Orestean</i>
trilogy, was O'Neill's version of the tragedy of the house of Atreus,
set in 19th-century New England. The action centers around Lavinia
(Electra). General Ezra Mannon, on his return from the American Civil
war, is killed by his wife Christine. Lavinia avenges her father's
murder by persuading her brother, Orin (Orestes), to kill her mother's
lover. The death is followed by the suicide of the mother. Orin goes
mad when he discovers that he has an incestuous passion for his sister.
Lavinia locks herself in the family mansion, surrounded by the ghosts
of the past.</p>
      <p>By 1930 O'Neill was so well-known that the Marx Brothers parodies his style in their film <span style="font-style: italic;">Animal Crackers</span>
(1930) and Cole Porter celebrated him in the lyrics of 'You're the Top'
(1934),&nbsp; "You're the top! / You're an arrow collar / You're the top! /
You're a Coolidge dollar, / You're the nimble tread / Of the feet of
Fred Astaire, / You're an O'Neill drama / You're Whistler's mama!" <br>
      </p>

<p>In 1935 O'Neill began work on a cycle of eleven plays, with the
theme of the turmoils of American materialism. The cycle was never
completed &#8211; only two plays have survived. On his final productive
period O'Neill wrote the autobiographical <i>Long Day's Journey into Night</i>,
an agonized portrait of his own family, the Tyrones in the play. Again
the action takes place in one room. Mary Tyrone returns to her dope
addiction: "None of us can help the things life has done to us" says
Mary. Edmund, based on the author himself, is stricken with
tuberculosis. The play was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in
1957. <i>Hughie  </i>(pub. 1959) was a story about a small time gambler, and <i>A Moon for the Misbegotten</i>  (pub. 1952) continued O'Neill's family history of the Tyrones. </p>
<p>At fifty O'Neill was at the peak of his artistic career. With his life
he lived in&nbsp; a Chinese-style, white concrete-block house on a 158-acre
estate, thirty-five miles east of San Francisco.However, his remaining creative years were characterized by long and rare
disease that caused progressive deterioration of cells of the
cerebellum. <i>The Iceman Cometh</i>,
perhaps the finest of O'Neill's tragedies, was written at the early
stage of his illness. The story is set in a dockside bar on the lower
west side of New York City. It concerns a group of drunken derelicts
who spend their time in the back room of Henry Hope's saloon where they
discuss their hopeless lives. One man wants to get back into the police
force, another to be re-elected as a politician. Their daily routines
are shattered when Hickey, a salesman and the son of a preacher,
appears as a messiah, and encourages them to start rehabilitation. They
find out that their new hero is himself a madman and murderer, who has
killed his wife, and lapse once more into their comfortable world of
whiskey. </p>
<p>Poor health also prevented O'Neill from attending the Nobel
ceremonies in Stockholm, Sweden. By 1943, O'Neill could no longer grasp
a pencil. After a failed production of <i>A Moon for the Misbegotten</i>
(1943), he wrote no major new plays. O'Neill became gradually paralyzed
and he died on November 27, 1953 in Boston. Shane O'Neill's family
biography, which came out in 1959, was entitled <i>The Curse of the Misbegotten</i>. </p>

 "<b>At
the start of the picture, everything was peachy-pie normal. Both the
lenses and the light could have been used for an Andy Hardy movie... As
the scenes progress and the truth comes more and more agonizing, the
lenses get wider and wider, the camera gets lower and lower, and the
light harsher but darker, as the whole story of these people gets
wrapped in night and the final, terrible truths are articulated."</b> (Lumet in </font><i><font size="2">Making Movies</font></i><font size="2">,
