      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American author who wrote about the American Revolutionary era. Kenneth Roberts' most famous novel is <span style="font-style: italic;">Northwest Passage </span>(1937).
Set during during the French and Indian War, it told about legendary
Major Rogers, whose career seen from a point of view of a struggling
artist. Roberts' narrative skills and larger-than-life characters made
his works
popular not only in the U.S. but in Western and Central Europe too.
Most of his life, Roberts lived in Maine, and drew on his
home state and his ancestors for his historical fiction. His books on
his belief in dowsing damaged his reputation and credentials as a
serious historian and writer. <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It has been my lot to have some
contact
with a man who was remarkable and strange; and by chance I encountered
him at periods important in the early history of my country. Given the
proper guidance, he might have been a greater prince than Jenghiz Khan.
To me, at times, he seemed almost a god: at other times possessed by
demons. Yet I think that at best he benefited his country more
substantially than have warriors, statesmen and authors of greater
renown; and at his worst, I suspect he fell no lower than any one of us
might fall, provided we had possessed his vision and energy to begin
with, and then had undergone the same exertions, the same temptations,
the same ingratitudes and disappointments he endured."</b> (From </font><font size="2"><span style="font-style: italic;">Northwest Passage</span>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Kenneth Roberts was born in Kennebunk, Maine, the son of Frank
Lewis
Roberts (1860-1911), a Boston traveling salesman, and Grace Tibbets Roberts (1858-1948). After graduating in 1908 from
Cornell University, Roberts worked as a journalist for the <span style="font-style: italic;">Boston Post</span>.
In
1911, he married the former Anna Seiberling Mosser, of the Boston
suburb Roxbury. She died in 1930; they did not have any children. <br>
</p>
      <p>During the end of World War I, Roberts served in the Intelligence
Section of the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia, commanded by Major General William S. Graves.
However, instead of seeing some action in the Russian Civil War, he was
assigned to the post of chief military censor in Vladivostok. Robert's stay was brief;
he felt unsuited to this kind of duty and returned home from&nbsp; in January
1919. Between Thanksgiving and January he wrote, "most of the
participants in the Siberian Expeditionary Force seemed semi insane
with cold, idleness and the depression that accompanies these two
curses." To avoid boredom, Roberts wrote as much as he could.<br>
      </p>

      
      
      
      <p>After the war, Roberts worked as a staff correspondent for George Horace Lorimer's
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span>
in Europe and America. By
1923, Roberts was back in Europe, and wrote for the newspaper a laudatory
series on Italian fascism, and reported on a politician named Adolf
Hitler, who was setting out to rescue Germany from Jews.<font size="-1"> </font>In 1927, Roberts decided to renovate an old farmhouse in Porto Santo
Stefano, Italy, to have "a retreat so far removed from bright lights
that I would be able to complete a series of novels within my norman
span of year." Roberts spent there seven winters.</p>

      <p>An opponent of President Franklin Roosevelt, Roberts fumed over the welfare state
and a road called the
Roosevelt Highway (Route No. 9): "It is a road of waffles. There are
stretches that lead the traveler to think the road was build in memory
of waffles long since dead; of waffles yet unborn; of frankfurter
sausages. As soon as one enters the Unites States he is in the Frank
and Waffle Belt. Hot waffles. Hot franks. Franks with skins and franks
without skins." <font size="-1">(From <span style="font-style: italic;">For Authors Only and Other Gloomy Essays</span>, 1935)</font> Roberts
gave up journalism in 1928 to become a full-time author. He began writing
historical novels as a reaction to
historians, who were "united in ignoring details, or in failing to dig
up the details which they should have possessed, or in pointing out the
misinterpretations and downright lies of which diarists, journalists
and so on were responsible. . . . " Intense in his opinions, Roberts repeatedly clashed with academic historians' conjectures.  <br>
      </p>


      <p>Roberts heroes were strong leaders who
dominate through their strength of personality. His first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Arundel</span>
(1930), was an account of Benedict Arnold's ill-fated expedition to Quebec during the
American Revolution. Its sequel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rabble
in Arms</span>
(1933) followed Arnold and his Northern Army from 1776 through 1777.
Roberts' great-great-grandfather had marched with Arnold through the
Maine and Canadian wilderness. <br>
</p>
      <p>The early novels did not sell particularly well. In <span style="font-style: italic;">I Wanted to Write</span> (1949) he bewailed that Chic Sale's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Specialist</span>, about building outdoor privies, had led the best-seller list for forty consecutive weeks, while he can't find <span style="font-style: italic;">Arundel </span>on any list of bestsellers. <span style="font-style: italic;">Northwest Passage<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>was
the story of Robert Rogers, his struggles in the French and Indian war,
and his later attempts to find a Northwest Passage. The book was
reprinted 15 times in the first year of issue.&nbsp; </p>

      <p>For his disappointment, <span style="font-style: italic;">Northwest Passage</span>, the public's favorite, did not win the Pulitzer Prize; it went to John P. Marquand's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Late George Apley</span>.
King Vidor's film version of the book, starring Spencer Tracy&nbsp; as
Major Rogers and Robert Young as Langdon Towne, covered only the first
half of the book.Vidor's film re-affirmed the novel's preference for a
strong leader and suspicion toward the majority-rule principle. Roberts
received in 1957 a special Pulitzer price for his contribution to an
interest in American history. <br>
      </p>

      <p>Roberts's novels were exhaustively researched and enjoyable read. However, forgetting good judgment, which he had
showed in his historical work, Roberts became a fiece advocate of
dowsing. His three books of the subject were <span style="font-style: italic;">Henry Gross and his Dowsing Rod</span> (1951), which sold 16,426 copies the first year, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Seventh Sense</span> (1953), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Water Unlimited</span>
(1957). With Henry Gross, a game warden, Roberts
traveled around the world, trying to find underground water veins, oil,
minerals and other natural resources with the help of a dowsing rod.
Roberts had first met Gross in 1947, when he asked him to find a new
well for him. Roberts was impressed by the mysterious powers of Gross,
who amazingly could work far away from the actual field sites. In his
books, Roberts recounted many of his friend's experiments in
long-distance dowsing. Gross
managed to locate three fresh water sources in Bermuda while sitting in
Kennebunkport &#8211; 800 miles away. Once he dowsed a map of Africa and
found a huge vein beneath the Sahara Desert. Gross also used the rod to
locate people and lost objets. His stick, usually made of fresh-cut
maple, could discern rye whiskey and other kind of liquors from each
other. Roberts wrote that "when the potentialities of
the rod are more clearly understood and utilized, it may rank with
electricity and atomic power." </p>

      <p>On
his Kennebunkport farm, Roberts maintained, raised and sold migration
birds.&nbsp; To prove that wood ducks can't be raised in an incubator
in singular seasoning he spent $2,000. Roberts died on July 21, 1957,
in&nbsp; Kennebunk. Roberts'
literary mentor was his neighbor Booth Tarkington, whom he dedicated <span style="font-style: italic;">Northwest Passage</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Oliver Wiswell</span> (1940), a tale of the American Revolution from the perspective of a colonial Loyalist soldier and historian, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Rabble in Arms</span>. Other notable novels include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lively Lady</span> (1931), dealing with the War of 1812, <span style="font-style: italic;">Captain Caution</span> (1934), a chronicle of Arundel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lydia Bailey</span> (1947), a picaresque romance, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Boon Island</span> (1956), based on the shipwreck of a British ship in 1710 on the tiny Boon Island off the coast of Maine. <span style="font-style: italic;">Moreau de St.-Méry's American Journey 1793-1798</span>, which he edited and translated with his wife Anna M. Roberts, came out in 1947. Roberts'
diaries are sealed until 2006. <br>
