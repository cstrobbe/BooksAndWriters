      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>German poet, playwright, and theatrical reformer, one of the
most prominent figures in the 20th-century theatre. Bertolt Brecht was
concerned with encouraging audiences to think
rather than becoming too involved in the story line and to identify
with the characters. In this process he used alienation effects (A
Effekts). Brecht developed a form of drama called epic theatre in which
ideas or didactic lessons are important. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In order to produce A Effects the
actor has to discard whatever means he has learned of persuading the
audience to identify itself with the characters which he plays. Aiming
not to put his audience into a trance, he must not go into a trance
himself. His muscles must remain loose, for a turn of the head, e.g.,
with tautened neck muscles, will "magically" lead the spectators' eyes
and even their heads to turn with it, and this can only detract from
any speculation or reaction which the gestures may bring about. His way
of speaking has to be free from ecclesiastical singsong and from all
those cadences which lull the spectator so that the sense gets lost." </b>(from<i>
A Short Organum for the Theatre</i>, 1948) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Bertolt Brecht was born in Augsburg, the son of Beltold
Brecht, the director of a
paper company, and Sophie Brezing, the daughter of a civil servant. His
father was a Catholic, and his mother a Protestant.
Both parents hailed from Achern in the Black Forest. Brecht began to
write poetry as a boy, and had his first poems
published in 1914. After finishing elementary school, he was sent
to the Königliches Realgymnasium, where he gained fame as an <em>enfant
terrible</em>. "Elementary shool bored me for four years," he later
recalled. "During nine years of being lulled to sleep at the Augsburg
Realgymnasium I didn't manage to be very much help to my teachers." </p>
      <p>In 1917 Brecht enrolled as a medical student at the Ludwig
Maximilian University of Munich, where he sometimes attended also the
theatre seminar conducted by Professor Artur Kutscher. Between 1919 and
1921 he wrote theatre criticisms for the left-wing Socialist paper Die
Augsburger. After military service as a medical orderly, he
returned to his studies, but abandoned them in 1921. During the
Bavarian revolutionary turmoil of 1918, Brech wrote his first
play, <span style="font-style: italic;">Baal</span>. From this period also dates his poem, 'Legend of the Dead
Soldier'. It was cited by the Nazis as one of their strong reasons to
deprive him of German citizeship in 1935. Like several other poems, it
was set to music by the author, and sung to the accompaniment of his
guitar in a Berlin cabaret: "And when the war was four Spring old / And
of peace there was not a breath / The soldier took the logical step /
And died a hero's death." The soldier is then dug up, pronounced fot
for active duty, and sent to the front, surrounded by a cheering crowd.
      </p>
      <p><i>Baal</i>, which celebrated life and sexuality, was produced
in 1923. Although it did not first find any immediate producer it
became eventually a huge success. At one point Brecht's father offered
to pay for the play to be printed, but only without the family name in
it. Brecht's association with
Communism began in 1919, when he joined the Independent Social
Democratic party. Friendship with the writer Lion Feuchtwanger was an
important
literary contact for the young writer. Feuchtwanger advised him on the
discipline of playwriting. Brecht was named in 1920 chief adviser on
play selection at the
Munich Kammerspiele. As a result of a brief affair with Fräulein Bie
Banholzer, Brecht had a son, named Frank after Wedekind. He was killed
in an air raid in Word War II. In 1922 Brecht married
the opera singer Marianne Zoff; they divorced in 1927. Later their
daughter Hanne was an occasional guest artist with the Berlin Enselble.
      </p>
      <p>Brecht´s rise to international fame began with <span style="font-style: italic;">Trommeln in der Nacht</span> (1922), which
was awarded the Kleist Prize. <span style="font-style: italic;">Die Dreigroschenoper</span>, after <i>The
Beggar´s Opera </i>by <a href="jgay.htm">John
Gay</a>, premiered at the Schiffbauerdamm Theater on August 28, 1928.
It stayed in the reportoire of this theater until the Nazis seized
power in 1933. Brecht made the play with
the composer Kurt Weil. Gay's work, revived by Sir Nigel Playfair at
the Lyric Theatre in London, had been a great success from 1920. Brecht
moved the action to Victorian times, and instead of mocking the
pretentions of Italian grand opera, he attacked on bourgeois
respectability. Although rehearsals were disastrous, the audience
wanted to hear over and over again the duet between Macheath and the
Police Chief, Tiger Brown.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Oh, the shark has pretty teeth,
dear - </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">And he shows them pearly white - </font><br>
        <font size="2">Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear - </font><br>
        <font size="2">And he keeps it out of sight." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Threepenny
Opera</font></i><font size="2">, 1928) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In
1924 Brech was appointed a
consultant at Max Reinhardt's Deutches Theater in Berlin.
He had a son, Stefan by the actress Helene Weigel in 1926; they married
two years later and stayed married for the rest of his life, in spite
of his infidelity. Though Brecht often treated women with breathtaking
insensitivity, he contributed through his work to the movement for
women's reproductive freedom. Sometimes he portrayed himself as a
country boy, never quite at home intellectual salons of the day. "He
was very lean, with a hungry face to which his cap gave a slightly
crooked look; his words were wooden and clipped," wrote Elias Canetti.
"Under his gaze you felt like a worthless heirloom, and he, the
pawnbroker with his piercing eyes, was appraising you." <br>
</p>
      <p>Around 1927 Brecht started to study Karl Marx's <em>Das
Kapital</em> and by 1929 he had adopted Communist ideology. At the
Schiffbauerdam Theater he trained many actors who were to become
famous on stage and screen, among them Oscar Homolka, Peter
Lorre, and the singer Lotte Lenya, Kurt Weil's wife. <span style="font-style: italic;">Mann ist Mann</span>, in which Lorre
played Galy Gay, a simple Irish dock worker, closed only after six
performances in 1931, but Brecht defended Lorre's performance as the
hallmark of a new style of acting. With Hanns
Eisler Brecht worked on a political film, <em>Kuhle Wampe</em>,
the name referring to an area of Berlin where the unemployed
lived in shacks. The film was released in 1932 and forbidden
shortly afterward.</p>

      <p>Brecht's politically committed play,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Die Maßnahme</span> (1930, The Measures
Taken) reflected his antisentimentality and directness, which even the
Communist Party found hard. A performance in Erfurt was broken up by
the police. In the play a young Communist is murdered by the Party<font face="Symbol"> -</font> his sympathy for the poor and their suffering
only postpones the day of the historical showdown between the working
class and capitalist class. The lesson is that the freedom of the
individual must be suppressed today so that in the future mankind will
be able to achieve freedom. </p>
      <p>In the 1930s Brecht´s books and plays were banned in Germany,
and theatrical performances were summarily
forbidden. On the following day of the burning of the Reichstag in
Berlin (Feb. 27, 1933), he went into exile, first to Denmark, where he
lived
mostly near Svendborg on the island of Fyn until 1939, and then in
April, 1940, to Finland, where he settled in Iitti in Villa
Marlebäck as the guest of the Finnish author <a href="hellawuo.htm">Hella
Wuolijoki</a>. The place is in the middle of the countryside, far from
the cities, and perhaps boring for a person used to lively metropolitan
surroundings. "... these light nights are very beautiful," Brecht wrote
in his diary. "i got up at three o'clock because of the flies, and went
out. cocks were crowing, but it had not been dark. i like to relieve
myself in the open ..." During the months at Marlebäck, Brecht wrote
with Wuolijoki the folk-comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">Herr
Puntila und sein Knecht Matti</span> (1940), and made during his stay
his admiring "surrogate mother" jealous because of affairs with other
women. Brech, who disliked bathing, was also famous for his
promiscuousness. </p>
      <p>Brecht
continued in May of 1941 with his wife, children and secretary through
Russia to the United States,
eventually ending in Santa Monica. Ruth Berlau, a Danish actress and
Brecht's mistress, had joined family in Helsinki and travelled with
them from Finland to America Margarete Steffin, a German proletarian
writer and Brecht's secretary and mistress, died in Moscow; she had
been tubercular when she left Germany. Like Berlau, she made
contributions to Brecht&#8217;s exile plays. </p>
      <p>The family settled down in a small house in Santa Monica,
California. Brech was prepared to stay longer, he made efforts to get
his plays produced on Broadway, and tried to
write for Hollywood, but the only script that found partial
acceptance was <i>Hangmen Also Die</i> (1942). This anti-Nazi film was
directed by Fritz Lang, the screenplay was written by John Wexley. "The
intellectual isolation here is enormous," Brecht compained. "Compared
to Hollywood, Svendborg was a world center." His ideas, such as "the
production, distribution and enjoyment of bread," were not taken
seriously by movie moguls. In 1947 Brecht was
accused of un-American activities, but managed to confuse with
half-truths J. Parnell Thomas, the chairman of the House Committee on
Un-American Activities, who praised Brecht for being an exemplary
witness. The Committee broadcast the hearings on the radio; the "Brecht
show" can be heard on a Folkways recording. However, Brecht had seen
the writing on the wall and he flew to Switzerland,
without waiting for the opening of his play<em> Galileo</em> in
New York.</p>
      <p>Between the years 1938 and 1945 Brecht wrote his four great
plays. <span style="font-style: italic;">Leben des Galilei</span> (1938-39, The Life of Galileo), which did
follow too slavishly the actual historical person, dealt with the
hero's
self-condemnation for giving up his heliocentric theory in front
of the Inquisition. Originally it was aimed at Broadway with Peter
Lorre and Lotte Lenya playing the central roles. <span style="font-style: italic;">Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder</span> (1939) was an
attempt to demonstrate that greedy small entrepreneurs make
devastating wars possible. "What they could do with round here is a
good war. What else can you expect with peace running wild all over the
place? You know what the trouble with peace is? No organization."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><span style="font-style: italic;">Der gute Mensch von Sezuan</span>
(1938-40)
examined the dilemma of how to be virtuous and at the same time
survive in a capitalist world, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Der kaukasische Kreidekreis</span>
(1944-45), demonstrating that ownership belongs best to those who
can make humane use of it. </p>
      <p>Hollywood never opened its doors to Brecht, who sketched notes
for more than fifty films. With one exception, he sold no stories and
wrote no screenplays. For Peter Lorre, who had become a star, Brecht
wrote film treatments and <span style="font-style: italic;">Schweyk im Zweiten Weltkrieg</span>, a stage version
of Jaroslav Hasek's <i>The Good Soldier &#352;vejk</i>. He was also
interested in bringing Edgar Lee Masters's <i>Spoon River Anthology</i>
to the screen. With Lion Feuchtwanger he collaborated on <i>The
Visions of Simone Machard</i>. Brecht received at least $20,000 for his
original idea. After 15 years of exile Brecht returned in 1948 to
Germany. "When they accused me of wanting to steal the Empire State
Building," Brech joked, "I thought it was high time to leave." Perhaps
anticipating that Lorre's career in Hollywood was turning down, Brecht
invited his favorite actor to join his ensemble in Berlin &#8211; "I need
Lorre, unconditionally," he said. At the same time, he was well aware
that Lorre
was a drug addict. Brecht spend a year in Zürich working on Sophocles&#8217; <i>Antigone</i>
(translated by <a href="holderli.htm">Friedrich Hölderin</a>) and
on his major theoretical work <i>A Little Organum for the Theatre</i>.
After Zürich, Brech moved in 1949 to Berlin where he founded his
own Marxist theater, the Berliner Ensemble, which was in the beginning
just a group within the larger organization of the Deutches Theater.
Its first production at the Stadttheater was <i>Herr Puntila und sein
Knecht Matti</i>. Brecht&#8217;s wife Helene
was his chief actress and
carried on as a director. </p>
      <p>Ingrid Pitt (1937-2010), one of the young actresses of the
Ensembe and a critic of the Communist government, was forced to flee
the country on the night of her debut performance in <i>Mother Courage
and Her Children</i>. She made in the 1970s a career as the first lady
of British horror cinema. Brecht had also some problems with the new
authorities of
DDR, although he wrote prose that pleased the
censors. When the workers of East Berlin rose in revolt, Brecht
expressed in a letter to the party chief, Walter Ulbricht, his loyalty
but also criticized the government. However, he never took a public
stand against the East Berlin regime. In his verse Brecht revealed his
angst with cryptic lines: "What times are these, when / to speak of
trees is almost a crime / because it passes in silence over such
infamy!" To assure for himself freedom
of travel, Brecht obtained the Austrian passport in 1950. </p>
      <p>In the West as well as in the East Germany Brecht became the
most popular contemporary poet, outdistanced only by such classics as
Shakespeare, Schiller, and Goethe. Jean Vilar's production of <i>Mutter
Courage</i> in 1951 secured him a following in France, and the Berliner
Ensemble's participation in the Paris International Theatre Festival
(1954) further spread his reputation. In 1955 Brecht received the
Stalin Peace Prize. His acceptance speech, delivered in Moscow, was
translated into Russian by Boris Pasternak. The next year he
contracted a lung inflammation and died of a coronary thrombosis
on August 14, 1956, in East Berlin. </p>
      <p>Brecht's works have been translated into 42 languages and sold
over 70 volumes. Drawing on the Greek tradition, he wanted his theater
to represent a forum for debate hall rather than a place of illusions.
From the Russian and Chinese theaters Brecht derived some of his basic
concepts of staging and theatrical stylization. His concept of the <i>Verfremdungseffekt</i>,
or V-Effekt (sometimes translated as 'alienation effect') centered on
the idea of "making strange" and thereby making poetic. He aimed to
take
emotion out of the production, persuade the audience to distance
from the make believe characters and urge actors to
dissociate from their roles. Then the political truth would be
more easy to comprehend. Once he said: "Nothing is more important than
learning to think crudely. Crude thinking is the thinking of great men."</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"His theater of alienation intended
to motivate the viewer to think. Brecht's postulate of a thinking
comportment converges, strangely enough, with the objective discernment
that autonomous artworks presupposes in the viewer, listener, or reader
as being adequate to them. His didactic style, however, is intolerant
of the ambiguity in which thought originates: It is authoritarian. This
may have been Brecht's response to the ineffectuality of his didactic
plays: As a virtuoso of manipulative technique, he wanted to coerce the
desired effect just as he once planned to organize his rise to fame."</b>
( Theodor Adorno in </font><i><font size="2">Aesthetic Theory</font></i><font size="2">, 1997) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Brecht formutated his literary theories much in reaction to <a href="lukacs.htm">Georg Lukács</a> (1885-1971), a Hungarian
philosopher and Marxist literary theoretician. He disapproved Lukács
attempt to distinguish between good realism and bad naturalism. Brecht
considered the narrative form of Balzac and Tolstoy limited. He
rejected Aristotele's concept of catharsis and plot as a simple story
with a beginning and end. From Marx he took the idea of superstructure
to which art belongs, but avoided too simple explanations of
ideological world view <font face="Symbol">- </font>exemplified in
the character of the Good Woman of Setzuan. </p>
