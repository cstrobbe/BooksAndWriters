<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Romanian-born historian of religion, fiction writer, and one of the pre-eminent interpreters of world religion in this century. Eliade was an intensely prolific author of fiction and non-fiction alike, publishing over 1,300 pieces over 60 years. He earned international fame with<EM> Le Mythe de l'eternel retour: arch&eacute;types et r&eacute;p&eacute;tition</EM>&nbsp;(1949, The Myth of the Eternal Return), an interpretation of religious symbols and imagery. Eliade was much interested in the world of the unconscious. The central theme in his novels was erotic love. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"In archaic and traditional societies, the surrounding world is conceived as a microcosms. At the limits of this closed world begins the domain of the unknown, of the formless. On this side there is ordered - because of inhabited and organized&nbsp;– space; on the other, outside this familiar space, there is the unknown and dangerous region of the demons, the ghosts, and the dead and foreigners – in a world, chaos or death or night. This image of an inhabited microcosm, surrounded by desert regions as a chaos or a kingdom of the dead, has survived even in highly evolved civilizations such as those of China, Mesopotamia and Egypt."</B> (from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Images and Symbols</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1952) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mircea Eliade was born in Bucharest, Romania, the son of Georghe (Ieremia) Eliade, an army officer. He had changed, according to Eliade, his name from Ieremia to Eliade due to his admiration for the writer Eliade-Radulescu. The family moved from Bucharest to Rimnicu-Sarat and later to Cernavoda. "In my memory," Eliade wrote in his autobiography, "that time spent there between the Danube and the brick-colored calcinated hills, where wild roses and tiny flowers with pale dry petals grew, is always lighted with sunshine." At school he was interested in biology and chemistry, and he had his own small laboratory. He read much, and increased this time reading books by sleeping only five-six hours. </P><P>While collecting material in Italy for his study on Renaissance philosophers,&nbsp;Eliade read Surendranath Dasgupta's work <I>A History of Indian Philosophy,</I> which impressed him deeply. After graduating in philosophy at Bucharest in 1928, he studied in India under Dasgupta at the University of Calcutta. Eliade was a talented student, but his relationship with Dasgupta became strained when he fell in love with Dasgupta's daughter Maitreya. During this period he wrote the erotic novel <EM>Isabel si apele diavolului </EM>(1930). </P>
<P>His experiences in the Himalayas, at Swami Shivananda's ashram, where he went to meditate, Eliade depicted in 
the novel&nbsp;<EM>Maitreyi</EM> (1933), which became a success. Eliade considered his tantric experiments in the Himalayas with the South African Jenny a proof that he had not understood India. "My vocation was culture, not sainthood." After military service Eliade took 
his doctorate in 1933&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG> his thesis dealt with the history of yogic techniques. In the same year Eliade was appointed associate professor in the faculty of letters at Bucharest University. In 1934 he married Nina Mares; she died of cancer in 1944. After publishing<EM> Domnisoara Christina</EM> (1936) Eliade was accused of pornography and dismissed from his office for a short time. The protagonist in the novel, based on Rumanian folk stories, was a <I>strigoi</I>, a ghost or vampire. The story dealt with the meaning of erotic life and death in human life.</P>
<P>In the 1930s and 1940s Eliade published several works of fiction. The unifying element of the early fiction is a strong, autobiographical bent. <I>Isabel si apele diavolui</I> was a thinly disguised story of a love affair between a European man and an Indian girl. In <SPAN class=ft><EM>&Icirc;ntoarcerea din rai</EM> </SPAN>(1934) and <EM>Huliganii</EM> (1935) the author went beyond his personal self, and depicted the 20th-century reincarnations of the older 'nihilists.' The 'hooligan' in the title referred to a person, who is guided by his inner visions and youthful energy, and who doesn't approve of the rules or beliefs of the outside world. The character bears resemlances to Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov and Kirilov. <EM>Lumina ce se stinge</EM> (1934) was an experimental novel using a Joycean stream-of-consciousness technique. Eliade's growing interest in the supernatural was seen in <I>Domnisoara Christina</I><I></I>, <EM>Sarpele</EM> (1937) and<EM> Secretul Doctorului Honigberger</EM> (1940, Two Tales of the Occult), which included the tales 'Nopti la Serampore' and 'Secretul doctorului Honigberger'. The title of the book referred to Dr. J.M. Honigberger, writer of the book <I>Thirty-five Years in the East</I> (1952).</P>
<P>In 1938 Nae Ionescu, professor at the faculty of philosophy, was arrested and Eliade was dismissed as his assistent. Ionescu was accused of being member of the Legion of the Archangel Michael (the "Iron Guard"), an extreme-right-wing Romanian organization, anti-Semitic, with Nazi sympathies. Soon also Eliade was arrested and he spent a short time in a concentration camp. From 1940 Eliade worked as a Romanian cultural attach&eacute; in London and in Lisbon (1941-44). After WW II he did not return to his home country, but held posts at various European universities. He lectured at the Sorbonne and taught for a while at the &Eacute;cole des Hautes &Egrave;tudes and elsewhere. While in Brian&ccedil;on he met a female occultist, the high priestess of an African secret society, who claimed that she could remember many of her previous incarnations. She lived in&nbsp;an elegant apartment and had forty or so disciples, each paying about ten thousand francs for an initiation&nbsp;course.&nbsp;"All this in the Paris of <FONT size=2>A.D.</FONT> 1950 is not only possible but also very profitable,"&nbsp;Eliade wrote in his <EM>Journal</EM>. </P><P>Eliade's friends during this period included Eug&egrave;ne Ionesco, Georges Dum&egrave;zil, and Georges Bataille. In 1950 he married Christinel Cottescu, a Romanian exile, whose sister was a professor of Latin. There is only a few refrences to her in Eliade's <EM>Journal I: 1945-1955</EM>, but in his<EM> Autobiography</EM> he devoted to her a whole chapter. "In contrast to her sister, Christinel was blond and blue-eyed, but like Sibylle she left her hair fall to her shoulders. That first image has never been erased from my mind: she laughed like a child, yet with a troubling feminity, showig her teeth, inclining her head slightly." </P><P>Eliade started to write <I>The Myth of the Eternal Return</I> in 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, when Europe was in ruins, and Communism was conquering Eastern European countries. The essay dealt with mankind's experience of history and time, especially the conceptions of being and reality. According to Eliade, in modern times people have lost their contact with natural cycles, known in traditional societies. Eliade saw that for human beings their inner, unhistorical world, and its meanings, were crucial. Behind historical processes are archaic symbols. Belief in a linear progress of history is typical for the Christian world view, which counters the tyranny of history with the idea of God, but in the archaic world of archetypes and repetition the tyranny of history is accepted. Stoics created from the concept of the eternal cycle a theory which embraced the whole universe. Eliade contrasts the Western linear view of time with the Eastern cyclical world view. In the 19th century Nietzsche's criticism of Christian dogmas brought back the idea of the eternal cycle to Western discussion. These ideas were further developed by Oswald Spengler in his study <I>The Decline of the West</I> (1918-1922). </P><P>Eliade's other major theoretical and scholarly works in the 1940s and 1950s include&nbsp;<EM>Trait&egrave; d'histoire des religions</EM> (1949, Patterns of Comparative Religion), <I>Le mythe de l'&eacute;ternel retrour</I>, and <SPAN class=st><SPAN class=ft><EM>Mythes, r&ecirc;ves et myst&egrave;res</EM> </SPAN></SPAN>(1957, Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries). <EM>The Forbidden Forest</EM>, which Eliade considered his major novel, came out in 1954
.&nbsp;</P><P>In 1957 Eliade assumed&nbsp;the chair&nbsp;of the&nbsp;History of Religions Department&nbsp;of&nbsp;the University of Chicago Divinity School, where he taught until 1983, retiring at the age&nbsp;of seventy-six. His office in Meadville-Lombard School of Religion caught fire in 1985. Most of his precious books were damaged by smoke and water, but his notebooks of his<EM> Journal</EM> survived relatively untouched. The fire had started on the desk, perhaps from pipe ashes in the ashtray. </P><P><EM>Histoire des croyances et des id&eacute;es religieuses</EM> (3 vols. 1976-1983, A History of Religious Ideas) has been called the synthesis of Eliade's work as a scholar. "The breadth and depth of Eliade's learning," wrote Roger Corless, "which astonished all who met him, his reverence toward the tradition he studied, and his intense, infectious enthusiasm, were an assurance that, if anyone could find what was religious about religion(s), he could. I believe the record shows that he could not. As a result, we now know a great deal more about religion(s) and we can ask totally new questions about it/them." &nbsp;<FONT size=2>('Building&nbsp;on Eliade's Magnificent Failure, in <I>Changing Religious Worlds: The Meaning and End of Mircea Eliade</I>, ed. by Bryan S. Rennie, 2000). </FONT>
</P>
<P>Since 1960&nbsp;Eliade suffered from the rheumatoid arthritis in his hands, which made writing extremely arduous for him. Eliade never returned to Romania, where he&nbsp;had been&nbsp;denounced as a "mystic" and "Fascist" by the Communist regime. However, during Ceausescu's era several of his books were published in Romanian translations. Eliade remained in the United States until his death on April 23, 1986. His body was cremated on the day following his death. Five years later the Divinity School of the University of Chicago became, dramatically, the scene of Ioan Culianu's death. Culianu&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG> the professor of the history of religion, Eliade's professional heir&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG> was killed in the restroom. He suspected that&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG> allegedly&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG> Eliade had been associated with the Iron Guard. After Eliade's death he started to develop his own theory of history. <FONT size=2>(see </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Eros, Magic, and the Murder of Professor Culianu </FONT></I><FONT size=2>by Ted Anton, 1997) </FONT></P>
<P>A central theme in Eliade's works was that the archaic religions made sacred the world in a fashion no longer available. Through the understanding of the relationship between the sacred and the profane it is possible to begin to understand the world of the past. Eliade's creative hermeneutics has received considerable criticism, and it has been said that his "main position is shrouded in ambiguities". Claude-Henri Rocquet has suggested the reader of Eliade is involved in "a hermeneutics without end, since even as we read Eliade, we are interpreting him, just as he is interpreting some Iranian symbol". </P>
<P>Eliade was a Christian and Jungian&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG> he met <A href="cjung.htm">Carl Jung</A> for the 
first time in 1950, and two years later he interviewed Jung at the Eranos 
Conference. "The modern world is desacralized," Jung said in the 
interview, "that is why it is in a crisis. Modern man must rediscover a deeper 
source of his own spiritual life." Also Eliade's works, such as <I>Myths, Dreams and 
Mysteries</I>, and <SPAN class=ft><EM>Aspects du mythe</EM> </SPAN>(1963, Myth and Reality), stressed the relevance of ancient religions for contemporary man. However, Jung insisted that the images of archaic man are much closer to the European and American psyche than Eliade admitted. Eliade later stopped using the term "archetype," which is familiar from Jung's works, in order to avoid Jungian and other misinterpretations. </P>
<P>In <EM>Le Sacr&eacute; et le Profane</EM> (1959, The Sacred and the Profane) Eliade argued that "the manifestation of the sacred ontologically founds the world." The traditional man, 'homo religiosus,' had a strong will to live within the sacred.or near the sacred objects. A sacred place possesses an unique existential value for religious man, but for nonreligious man, space is neutral. Although modern man seems to experience the world completely as profane, ancient myths, taboos, and rituals still nourish life in the West, but in a corrupted form. </P>
<P>According to Eliade, shamanism is "one of the archaic techniques of ecstasy&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp; at once mysticism, magic, and 'religion' in the broadest sense of the term." He wanted to restrict the term 'shaman' to those who went into trances and who would address the tribe through a spirit or would visit the spirit world and return. <A href="jfrazer.htm">James Frazer</A> described bluntly the evidence of superhuman powers in <I>The Golden Bough</I> (1890) as spurious, but Eliade himself was convinced that shamanism had a paranormal component. In <I>Shamanism </I>(1968) he argued that epics of ancient poets and certain kinds of fairy tales derive from ecstatic journeys and mystical flights. Throughout his life Eliade believed in destiny, "in the sense that I think there is something that cannot be explained&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG> I can't call it Providence&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT size=2>–</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;but certainly there is something that&nbsp; cannot be explained. . . ." </P>

<P>In his novels Eliade used the conventional repertory of fantasy: 
vampires, serpents, ghosts, time warp, searches for immortality. Most of Eliade's postwar 
fiction dealt with the hidden world behind everyday reality. Among his masterpieces is<EM> La </EM><SPAN class=ft><EM>For&ecirc;t interdite</EM> </SPAN>
(The Forbidden Forest), which appeared in English in 1978. <EM>Pe strada M&acirc;ntuleasa</EM> 
(1968, The Old Man and the Bureaucrats) is an allusive and symbolic novella in which a schoolteacher detained for questioning by Communist authorities beguiles his captors with stories, as the enslaved Sheherazade in <I>The Arabian Nights</I>.</P>
