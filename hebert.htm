<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French-Canadian novelist, poet, playwright, and short-story writer, noted for her examination of the lives of the Quebe&ccedil;ois. H&eacute;bert combined realism and symbolism, and reworked the tradition of the historical novel. In her poems H&eacute;bert used free verse with dense, almost surrealistic images. Her novels, of which the most famous is <EM>Kamouraska</EM> (1970),&nbsp;show influence of the French <I><A href="../../../csimon.htm">nouveau roman</A></I> and postmodern narrative techniques.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><STRONG>"Oh, how I love to walk through the streets, with the image of my virtue just a few steps ahead! Never out of my sight. Eyes peeled, like a prison guard. Always on that image. The Sacred Host in the holy procession. And me, right behind, like a silly litte goose. Yes, that's all a virtuous woman is. A gaping fool that stuts along, staring at the image of her honor . . . "</STRONG> (from <EM>Kamouraska</EM>) </FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Anne H&eacute;bert was born in the small village of Sainte-Catherine-de-Fossambault, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Qu&eacute;bec city. She started to write poetry in her teens under the tutelage of her father, Maurice-Lang H&eacute;bert (1888-1960), a provincial civil servant and a distinguished literary critic. Another crucial person in H&eacute;bert's life was her cousin, Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau (1912-43), a poet, who died of a heart attack at the age of 31. He was H&eacute;bert's frequent companion during her youth. </P>
<P>H&eacute;bert attended Coll&egrave;ge Saint-Coeur de Marie, Merici, Quebec, and Coll&egrave;ge Notre Dame, Bellevue, Quebec. In the 1940s, H&eacute;bert was briefly affiliated with the newly established government film bureau. From 1950 to 1954 H&eacute;bert&nbsp;wrote scripts for Radio Canada, and then&nbsp;worked as a scriptwriter and editor&nbsp;for&nbsp;National Film Board of Canada (1953-54, 1959-60). With the support of a grant from the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Royale of Canada, she moved to Paris in the mid-1950s, the location of many of his stories, but made frequent visits to Montr&eacute;al. Eventually in 1967, she settled in Paris. In her voluntary exile, H&eacute;bert often dealt with the themes of isolation, alienation, and repressive nature of small communities. </P>
<P>H&eacute;bert's first collection of poems, <EM>Les Songes en &Eacute;guilabre,&nbsp;</EM>was published&nbsp;in 1942. Its romantic tone was far from the violent images of her next book, <I>Le Torrent</I> (1950, The Torrent), a collection of short stories, which was rejected by editors for its violence. In <I>Le Tombeau des Rois </I>(1953), her second book of poetry, H&eacute;bert explored her anguish, the stifling responsibilities of maturity, and repression and revolt. <I>Po&egrave;mes</I> (1960) earned her the Governor General's Literary Award. In 1960 she was elected to the Royal Society of Canada and she was a Companion of the Order of Canada. She also received several honorary doctorates. </P>

<P>Fantastic elements were present already in H&eacute;bert's first novel, <I>Les Chambres de bois</I> (1958, The Silent Rooms), and continued to appear in her subsequent works, such as in <I>H&eacute;lo&iuml;se </I>(1980), in which the title character, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, belongs to a community of vampires that dwells among abandoned Parisian subway stations and when not drinking Bloody Marys,&nbsp;suck the blood of M&eacute;tro passengers. Open to many intepretions, in this H&eacute;bert's work the vampire can be understood as a metaphor for hidden otherness. <I></I></P>
<P><I>Les Chambres de bois</I> was about a woman whose husband has a horror of sex. The heroine, Catherine, revolts against the marital prison, and breaks out of the rooms of the title. <I>Kamouraska</I>, which began the cycle set in the 19th-century Quebec, was based on historical murder case and stories H&eacute;bert's mother had told her. The central character is woman who conspires with her lover to murder her husband. H&eacute;bert's narrative changes from first person to the third, she enters the mind of Elisabeth, and reveals her revolt behind her submissive appearence: "A swine! His words, my husband's very words. Yes, that's what he is. A swine. That's just what he is." <EM>Kamouraska</EM> was translated into thirteen languages. H&eacute;bert co-wrote with the director Claude Jutka the screenplay for&nbsp;its film version (1973), starring Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold.</P>
<P><I>Les Enfants du Sabbat</I> (1975, Children of the Black Sabbath), set in a Quebec convent, was a tale of witchcraft, incest, and intercourse with the devil. Julie, the protagonist, is dedicated to sorcery and lives out a perverse version of the virgin birth. The novel was poortly received in Quebec, but it won the Governor General's Literary Award. </P><P><I>Les fous de Bassan </I>(1982, In the Shadow of the Wind) depicted people in an English-speaking village in the Gasp&eacute;. Six narratives relate from different angles rape and murder of two cousins, Nora and Olivia Atkins. One of the narrator is their cousin Stevens Brown, the murderer. Nora also tells her story, and about her sexual awakening. "I know about boys. That sting in the middle of their bodies, while I, I am hollow and moist. Waiting." The sixth narrator is the spirit of Olivia. The book was a best seller in Canada and in France it was awarded the 1982 Prix Femina. "The power in this haunting book <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> a power that seems in no way diminished in translation <FONT face=Symbol>-</FONT> comes from the language, the rich, inventive images, the heated, melodious prose. The winds Anne Hebert stirs up in her readers' minds do not die down until long after the book has been closed." <FONT size=2>(</FONT><FONT size=2>C. B. Bryan in <I>The New York Times</I>, </FONT><FONT size=2>July 22, 1984) </FONT></P>
<P>In the late 1990s, H&eacute;bert returned to Canada after learning she was terminally ill. She died of bone cancer on January 22, 2000, in Montreal, Quebec, and was buried in her native village in the cemetery of the Church of Saint-Dominique. H&eacute;bert never married and had no children. Her final novel, <I>Un Habit de lumi&egrave;re</I>,&nbsp;about a family torn apart by secred dreams, came out&nbsp;in 1998. Again there is a fusion of contrasts typical of H&eacute;bert's work: the day and night, good and evil,&nbsp;life and death. </P>
