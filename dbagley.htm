<p>A British thriller writer, who gained world fame in the 1960s and
published 16 popular adventure novels. On his rough, several years long
trip from England to South Africa, Desmond Bagley gathered a colourful
life experience that was highly useful later, when he started his
career as a writer. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>I threw discretion to the winds. "There's
over £1,500,000 in gold alone &#8211; and there's probably an equal amount in
cut gem-stones. The gold alone means £300,000 for a fifth share and
that's £6,000 each for your friends. If you count the jewels you can
double those figures." Her eyes widened as she mentally computed this
into lire. It was an astronomical calculation and took some time.</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">
"So much," she whispered.</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">
(from </font><i><font size="2">The Golden Keel</font></i><font size="2">, 1963) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>Desmond Bagley was born in Kendal, Westmoreland (now, Cumbria), in
England's Lake District. His father, John Bagley, was a miner. After
his health began to fail, the family moved to Blackpool. Bagley
attended a variety of schools is Bolton and Blackpool, showing talents
especially in mathematics. At the age of 14 Bagley left school and
began his working life as a printer's devil, and changed then to a
factory, where he made plastic electrical fittings. Between the years
1940 to 1946, he worked in the aircraft industry, making parts for
warplanes. At an early age, Bagley had begun to stammer and he was not
called for military service during the war. In 1947 Bagley began his
long journey to South Africa by road. He crossed the Sahara, got work
in Kampala in Uganda, contracted malaria, and worked his way down
Africa, taking various jobs in asbestos and gold mines. While in Natal,
Bagley developed his interest in journalism. <br>
<br>
In the 1950s Bagley lived in South Africa. There he became a freelance
journalist, working for the Broadcasting Company in Durban (1951-52),
and writing film critiques for <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>
in Johannesburg (1958-62). In 1960-61 he was a writer for Filmlets Ltd.
In 1960 Bagley married Joan Magaret Brown, who ran a flourishing
bookshop. They spent some months in the 1960s in Italy, sightseeing.
Before moving to Guernsey, they lived in Devon from 1965 to 1976. <br>
<br>
Bagley wrote his books on a typewriter using one finger and later had a
Xerox dedicated word processor. Bagley's wife Joan became his
invaluable research assistance and the first reader of his manuscripts.
Bagley's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Golden Keel</span>
(1963), became an immediate success. The novel was based supposedly on
a true story, which Bagley heard in a bar in Johannesburg. During World
War II Mussolini's vast personal treasures were moved from north in a
German S.S. convoy. As the convoy neared the Ligurian coast, it
vanished. An old soldier, named Walker, told Bagley that he really knew
where Mussolini's missing gold was, and even suggested the idea of
taking a yacht to the Mediterranean, and melting the gold down to make
a golden keel. Around this <i>coup</i> Bagley spun a tale, where a
successful Cape Town boat-builder designs an ocean-going yacht, sails
to the Mediterranean, and with his companion attempts to get the
treasure out of Italy. <br>
<br>
Like <a href="hinnes.htm">Hammond Innes</a>, <a href="maclean.htm">Alistair MacLean</a>,
and Geoffrey Jenkins, Bagley created fast moving stories with rich
local colour, ranging from the jungles of South America to the interior
of Iceland. The settings were international, and Bagley also offered
detailed information for the readers from a variety of subjects, such
as genetic engineering in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Enemy </span>(1977), the behaviour of hurricanes in <span style="font-style: italic;">Wyatt's Hurricane</span> (1966), earth tremors in <span style="font-style: italic;">Landslide</span> (1967), the Finnish way of life in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Tightrope Men</span> (1973), and avalanches in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Snow Tiger&nbsp;</span> (1975), set in New Zealand. In the frame of an adventure story, <span style="font-style: italic;">Flyaway</span>
(1978) gives more information of peoples, customs, traditions, and
nature of the Sahara desert than an ordinary travel guide. With his
attention to environmental issues Bagley was ahead of his time. <br>
<br>
Bagley was always very popular in the Scandinavian countries,
especially in Finland and Norway, where his readers share the author's
love for the outdoor life. The protagonist of <i>The Tighrope Men</i>,
Giles Denison, wakes up in a hotel in Oslo, and sees a strange face in
the mirror. His name is Harold Feltham Meyrick, he has a Patek Philippe
watch, and an English passport. The MacGuffin of the story is a book
full of mathematical symbols, buried near the Finnish border, on the
Russian side. Bagley also touches such diverse subjects as the Finnish
national epic <i>Kalevala</i>, the temperature of sauna, and paper-making machines. </p>
<p>Several of Bagley's books have been adapted to the screen. His spy thriller <span style="font-style: italic;">The Freedom Trap</span> (1971) was filmed in 1973 under the title<i> The Mackintosh Man</i>,
starring Paul Newman, James Mason, and Dominique Sanda. In the story a
freelance agent is hired to catch a Communist spy. Sanda is a jewel
thief or a member of the British Secret Service, or both. Walter Hill
wrote the screenplay. The director, John Huston considered the film a
failure. He was offered a good sum of money to direct it, but he was
from the beginning plagued by the screenplay's weaknesses. "The worst
part was that the story lacked an ending. All the time we were filming
we were casting about frantically for an effective way to bring the
picture to a close. Finally, during the very last week of shooting, an
idea came to us. It was far and away the best thing in the movie, and I
suspect that if we had been able to start shooting with it in the mind,
<i>The Mackintosh Man</i> would have been a really good film. But we weren't. As it is, I know hardly anyone who has ever heard of it." <font size="2">(John Huston in </font><i><font size="2">An Open Book</font></i><font size="2">, 1980) </font><br>
<br>
In several novels Bagley used first-person narrative, a suggestive
method which draws the reader into the best lookout spot of the events.
Reginal Hill stated in his article in <i>Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers</i>
(1985), that "as long as meticulous craftsmanship and honest
entertainment are valued, and as long as action, authenticity, and
expertise still make up the strong framework of the good
adventure/thriller, Desmond Bagley's books will surely be read."
Bagley's career spanned two decades. His influence can be seen in the
works of such highly acclaimed thriller writers as Ken Follet and
Duncan Kyle, who published their first novels in the 1970s. From the
younger generation writers, the Guernsey-based John Templeton Smith had
personal contact with Bagley &#8211; he was Smith's mentor in the late 1970s.
</p>
<p>Bagley also published short stories. When not travelling in search of the background for his novel, 
Bagley spent his time sailing with his wife and motor-boating. 
He loved classical music and films, military history and played war 
games. Bagley's friends included the mystery novelist and composer Robert Bruce 
Montgomery, who wrote under the pseudonym Edmund Crispin. 
One evening in the early 1970s Montgomery telephoned, whether he could come 
and watch with them a particular thiller for which he had composed the score. 
"I've never sat through a movie with the composer sitting next to me and it was an odd 
experience," recalled Joan Bagley. "We saw the entire film in its musical context, accompanied 
by a running commentary." <font size="2"> (In  <i>Bruce Montgomery/Edmund Crispin: 
A Life in Music and Books</i> by David Whittle, 2007.)</font> 
Bagley's last books, <span style="font-style: italic;">Night of Error</span> (1983), in which an oceanographer investigates the 
death of his brother, and 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Juggernaut</span> (1984), were published posthumously and completed by his wife Joan 
Magaret. <i>Juggernaut</i> was set in 
Nyala, an imaginary African country. Neil Mannix, the protagonist, tries to move a giant transformer, on a low-bed 
trailer, across the country. The Juggernaut is nearly 80 meters long and has 96 wheels. When the civil war breaks out, 
the transportation project is doomed &#8211; which can be read as a comment on the results of development co-operation 
activities. </p>
<p>Bagley died on the 12'th of April, 1983 in Southampton. After a
stroke he had been flown to Southampton for treatment; he died eight
days later. Bagley's works have been translated into some 20 languages.
