<p>American novelist who  gained international fame with her Earth's Children series, 
sagas about life in the Stone Age Europe and the early tribesmen.  Begun in 1980 with
<i>The Clan of the Cave Bear</i>, the six-volume 
series was concluded in 2011. Auel's novels
are detailed and based on research but they are also colored with a captivating storyline and vivid 
imagination. 
By 2010, her prehistoric romances had sold more than 45 million copies in 28 languages. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Clan Gatherings were also a time to
reestablish old acquaintances, see relatives from other clans, and
exchange gossip and stories that would enliven many a cold winter
evening for the next few years. Young people, unable to find mates
within their own clan, vied for each other's attention, though matings
could only take place if the woman was acceptable to the leader of the
young man's clan. It was considered an honor for a young woman to be
chosen, especially by a clan of a higher status, although moving away
would be traumatic for her and her loved ones left behind."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Clan of the Cave Bear</font></i><font size="2">, 1980) </font></blockquote>
<p>Jean Marie Auel was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Neil
S. Untinen, a housepainter, and Martha (Wirtanen) Untinen. Jean Marie
was the second of five children. Upon graduating from Jones Commercial
High School in Chicago, she married Ray Bernard Auel in 1954; they had
five children within six years. As a counterbalance to her daily
household affairs, she became in 1964 an active member of Mensa. In
1965-66 she was employed as a clerk in Beaverton, Oregon, then as a
circuit board designer (1966-1973), technical writer (1973-74), and
eventually a credit manager (1974-1976). <br>
</p>
      <p>After studies at Portland State University, Oregon 
and University of Portland, Auel received her M.B.A. in 1976, at the age of forty. 
In the same year she got the idea for a story about a girl, Ayla, living amongst people who are different from her. 
(Her name may be derived from a corrupted form of the Finnish first name Aila.) 
Auel left her well-paying position in a Portland electronics plant and devoted herself entirely to writing. </p>

<p>The idea started to grow and after intense research she finished 
a 450,000 word 
manuscript. However, dissatisfied with her work, she then 
borrowed from a library writing guides and wrote several more drafts. 
During the long creative process, Auel learned ancient hunting methods, tanning methods, 
how to knapp flint and prepare food from caribou brain. She had difficulties to find a publisher for her 
novel, especially because she planned to continued the story in five subsequent books. <i>The Clan of the Cave Bear </i>(1980), the first in the Earth's Children Series,  became <i></i>
one of the major works in the evolution of prehistoric romances. It was
an immediate success, sold over three million paper-back copies and
earned her an American Book Award Nominatiom. Auel's story of
self-discovery, 'The Ugly Duckling' set in the ancient times, was
translated into several languages, among others into Finnish <font face="Symbol">-</font>
Auel's grandparents, families Untinen and Virtanen, originated from
Finland, Ostrobothnian region, known for its independent and
enterprising people. </p>
<p>Auel starts series with a story of survival. An orphaned Cro-Magnon
child, Ayla, is adopted by the Neanderthal Clan of the Cave Bear. She
grows up in the Neanderthal community, which is ruled by traditions and
taboos. "Before dipping in and disturbing the mirrored surface, she
leaned over and looked at herself. She studied her features carefully;
she didn't seem so ugly this time, but it wasn't herself she was
interested in. She wanted to see the face of the Others." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Clan of the Cave Bear</font></i><font size="2">) </font><br>
</p>
      <p>Ayla is considered a misfit, and her rebelling against male
dominance is punished. However, as a blond, blue-eyed woman she is more
than a typical "Aryan" heroine <font face="Symbol">-</font> she is a
combination of Tarzan's Jane, Florence Nightingale, Marie Curie and
Amelia Earhart in the same person. Her intelligence separates her from
the other tribe members, although physically she is submitted to the
leader of the Neanderthals. Finally she is forced to leave her son and
to seek her own destiny. In 1988, parents of students attending Berrien
Springs High School in Michigan challenged the use of the novel in
classroom. Five years later the novel was challenged at Moorpark High
School in Sunneyville, California. Parents complained that the novel
contained "hardcore graphic sexual content." <br>
 </p>

<p>In <i>The Valley of Horses </i>(1983) Ayla searches for the Others,
her own race. She learns the secrets of fire, and is helped by animals.
The story introduces Ayla's mate Jondalar, a Cro-Magnon man, also tall
and yellow-haired.<i> The Mammoth Hunters</i> (1985), which sold
1,100,000 copies, presents a triangle drama between Ayla, the
dark-skinned Ranec, and jealous Jondalar. Ayla also finds her first
women friends among the tribe of Mamutoi and learns the customs and
language of the Others. In <i>Plains of Passage </i>(1990) Ayla treks
with Jondalar through the grasslands of Ice Age Europe to reach a place
they can call home. Jondalar is captured by man-hating women and
rescued by Ayla. In the end of the story Ayla is happily pregnant.
Before the story of Ayla continued, readers had to wait 12 years. </p>
<p>In the fifth book, <i>The Shelters of Stone</i> (2002), Ayla struggles for her place 
in Jondalar's tribe, the Zelendonii. "She was a stranger, a disturbing stranger 
who brought animals and who knew what other threatening foreign ways and outrageous ideas. 
Would they accept her? What if they didn't? She couldn't go back, her people lived more 
than a year's travel to the east. Jolandar had promised that he would leave with her if 
she wanted &#8211; or was forced &#8211; to go, but that was before he saw everyone, 
before he was greeted so warmly. How would he feel now?" Ayla and 
Jondalar prepare for the formal mating at the Summer Meeting, she faces 
Jondalar's former lover, Marona, and proves her skills as a healer. The 
fifth installment was a disappointment for Katherine A. Powers, who wrote in 
<i>The Washington Post</i>: "It strikes one as being a romance for people 
who fantasize about going into business -- something with a strong emphasis on crafts 
and home products and professional conferences. In other words, the spirit of Martha 
Stewart informs the pages as much as the Great Mother's does." The story is 
still not closed<font face="Symbol"></font>... The 6th and supposedly final volume 
in the Earth's Children series is entitled <i>Land of Painted Caves</i> (2011). Auel has 
also planned to write a prehistoric murder mystery. </p>
<p>Auel uses the prehistoric  setting to explore gender roles, drawing parallels between cave society 
and contemporary social structures. Though her Stone Age fantasy  in many respects contradict archaeologists 
vision of the past, she has managed to create a fictional world, that seems to correspond to reality, at 
least more than Edgar Rice Burroughs's adventure stories. 
Ayla is a feminist heroine from the theories of matriarchal prehistory, 
she hunts with the men, but she is not a warlike Amazon or an Upper Paleolithic female Tarzan.  
She is a conciliator and innovator, the first to ride on a horse and tame a wolf as a domestic animal, 
she knows the secrets of the herbs, and she invents a new technique for making 
fire by striking iron pyrite onto flint. Auel pays much attention to female resourcefulness, 
which is a constant source of astonishment and doubt for politically reactionary cave men, 
especially the Neanderthals. 
"Her brain followed different paths, her full, high forehead that housed forward-thinking 
frontal lobes, gave her an understanding from a different view." 
However, Auel's attempt 
to impose the changing social roles of modern women on prehistory has 
been criticized by Joseph Carroll as resulting in "absurd perspectival misconstructions". </p>
<p>The film adaptation of <i>The Clan of the Cave Bear </i>(1985), produced on Canadian exteriors, 
combined sex, stone-age, and anthropology. It was not so realistic as <i>Quest for Fire </i>(1981), 
dealing with the problems of primitive men, or humorous 
as  the legendary animated series <i>Flintstones</i>, 
but far more intelligent than <i>One Million Years BC</i>
(1966), starring Raquel Welsh in her famous fur trimmed bikini. The
long-limbed, healthy-looking Daryl Hannah as Ayla is a sympathetic
pre-historic feminist <font face="Symbol">-</font> before this role, she just had played a replicant, and mermaid, and left these these kind characters for a while. </p>
<p>Auel has received several awards, including an American Book Award
nomination for best first novel and Friends of Literature Award for <i>The Clan of the Cave Bear</i>
(1981), Scandinavian Kaleidoscope of Art and Life Award (1982), Golden
Plate award (1986), American Academy of Achievement (1986), Silver
Trowel Award (1990), National Zoo Award (1990), Waldo award from
Waldenbrooks, and Persie Aeard for WIN (both 1990). She has honorary
degrees from University of Portland, University of Maine, and Mt.
Vernon College. </p>
