<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English writer, who first gave the novel
its modern character through the treatment of everyday life. Although
Austen was widely read in her lifetime, she published her works
anonymously. The most urgent preoccupation of her bright, young
heroines is courtship and finally marriage. Austen herself never
married. Her best-known books include <span style="font-style: italic;">Pride and Prejudice</span> (1813) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Emma</span> (1816). Virginia Woolf called Austen "the most perfect artist among women." </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</b> (from</font><i><font size="2"> Pride and Prejudice</font></i><font size="2">, 1813) </font></blockquote>

<p>Jane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, where her father, Rev.
George Austen, was a rector. She was the second daughter and seventh
child in a family of eight. The Austens did not lose a single one of
their children. Cassandra Leigh, Jane's mother, fed her infants at the
breast a few months, and then sent them to a wet nurse in a nearby
village to be looked after for another year or longer. </p>
<p>The first 25 years of her life Jane spent in Hampshire. On her
father's unexpected retirement, the family sold off everything,
including Jane's piano, and moved to Bath. Jane, aged twenty-five, and
Cassandra, her elder sister, aged twenty-eight, were considered by
contemporary standards confirmed old maid, and followed their parents.
Torn from her friends and rural roots in Steventon, Austen abandoned
her literary career for a decade. </p>
<p>Jane Austen was mostly tutored at home, and irregularly at school,
but she received a broader education than many women of her time. She
started to write for family amusement as a child. Her parents were avid
readers; Austen's own favorite poet was Cowper. Her earliest-known
writings date from about 1787. Very shy about her writing, she wrote on
small pieces of paper that she slipped under the desk plotter if anyone
came into the room. In her letters she observed the daily life of her
family and friends in an intimate and gossipy manner: "James danced
with Alethea, and cut up the turkey last night with great perseverance.
You say nothing of the silk stockings; I flatter myself, therefore,
that Charles has not purchased any, as I cannot very well afford to pay
for them; all my money is spent in buying white gloves and pink
persian." <font size="2">(Austen in a letter to her sister Cassandra in 1796) </font></p>
<p>Rev. George Austen supported his daughter's writing aspirations,
bought her paper and a writing desk, and tried to help her get a
publisher. After his death in 1805, she lived with her sister and
hypochondriac mother in Southampton. In July 1809 they moved to a large
cottage in the village of Chawton. This was the place where Austen felt
at home. She never married, she never had a room of her own, but her
social life was active and she had suitors and romantic dreams. <br>
</p>
      <p>Between 1801 and 1811 Austen barely wrote anything. With
Tom Lefroy, whom she met a few times in 1796, she talked about
Fielding's <i>Tom Jones</i>. They shared similar sense of ironic
humour and Austen was undeniably attracted to him. James Edward
Austen-Leigh, her nephew, wanted to create another kind of legend
around her and claimed that "of events her life was singularly barren:
few changes and no great crises ever broke the smooth current of its
course... There was in her nothing eccentric or angular; no ruggedness
of temper; no singularity of manner..." Austen's sister Cassandra also
never married. One of her brothers became a clergyman, two served in
the navy, one was mentally retarded. He was taken care of a local
family. </p>

<p>Jane Austen was well connected with the middling-rich landed gentry
that she portrayed in her novels. In Chawton she started to write her
major works, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">Sense and Sensibility</span>,
the story of the impoverished Dashwood sisters, Marianne and Elinor,
who try to find proper husbands to secure their social position. The
novel was written in 1797 as the revision of a sketch called <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>,
composed when the author was 20. According to some sources, an earlier
version of the work was written in the form of a novel in letters, and
read aloud to the family as early as 1795. </p>
<p>Austen's heroines are determined to marry wisely and well, but romantic Marianne of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> is a character, who feels intensely about everything and loses her heart to an irresponsible seducer.  <font size="2">"</font>I
could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point
coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the same with
books, the same music must charm us both."<font size="2">  </font>Reasonable
Elinor falls in love with a gentleman already engaged. '"I have
frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," said Elinor, "in
a total misapprehension of character in some point or another: fancying
people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they
really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception
originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves, and
very frequently by what other people say of them, without giving
oneself time to deliberate and judge."' </p>
<p>When Marianne likes to read and express her feelings, Elinor prefers
to draw and design and be silent of his desires. They are the daughters
of Henry Dashwood, whose son, John, from a former marriage. After his
death, John inherits the Norland estate in Sussex, where the sisters
live. John's wife, the greedy and selfish Fanny, insists that they move
to Norland. The impoverished widow and and her daughters move to Barton
Cottage in Devonshire. There Marianne is surrounded by a devious
heartbreaker Willoughby, who has already loved another woman. Elinor
becomes interested in Edward Ferrars, who is proud and ignorant.
Colonel Brandon, an older gentleman, doesn't attract Marianne. She is
finally rejected by Willoughby. "Marianne Dashwood was born to an
extraordinary fate. She was born to discover the falsehood of her own
opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favorite maxims."
</p>
<p>In all of Austen's novels her heroines are ultimately  married. 
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i> described the clash between Elizabeth
Bennet, the independent and intelligent daughter of a country
gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner, who
both are blinded by their assumptions and desires. Their relationship
starts from dislike, but Darcy becomes intrigued by her mind and
spirit, and the "beautiful expression of her dark eyes". She rejects
his first marriage proposal but eventually barriers are swept aside and
Elizabeth and Darcy are happily united. Austen had completed the early
version of the story in 1797 under the title "First Impressions". The
book went to three printings during Austen's lifetime. In 1998 appeared
a sequel to the novel, entitled <i>Desire and Duty</i>, written by Teddy F. Bader, et al. 
It followed  the ideas Jane Austen told her family. </p>
<p><i>Emma </i> was written in comic tone. Austen begun the novel in
January 1814 and completed it in March of the next year. The book was
published in three volumes. It told the story of Emma Woodhouse, who
finds her destiny in marriage. Emma is a wealthy, pretty,
self-satisfied young woman. She is left alone with her hypochondriac
father. Her governess, Miss Taylor, marries a neighbor, Mr. Weston.
Emma has too much time and she spends it choosing proper partners for
her friends and neighbors &#8211; blind to her own feelings. She makes a
protégée of Harriet Smith, an illegitimate girl of no social status and
tries to manipulate a marriage between Harriet and Mr. Elton, a young
clergyman, who has set his sight on Emma. Emma has feelings about Mr.
Weston's son. When Harriet becomes interested in George Knightley, a
neighboring squire who has been her friend, Emma starts to understand
her own limitations. He has been her moral adviser, and secretly loves
her. Finally Emma finds her destiny in marriage with him. Harriet, who
is left to decide for herself, marries Robert Martin, a young farmer. </p>
<p>Jane Austen focused on middle-class provincial life with humor and
understanding. She depicted minor landed gentry, country clergymen and
their families, in which marriage mainly determined women's social
status. Most important for her were those little matters, as Emma says,
"on which the daily happiness of private life depends." Although Austen
restricted to family matters, and she passed the historical events of
the Napoleonic wars, her wit and observant narrative touch has been
inexhaustible delight to readers.</p>
      <p>Of her six great novels, four were
published anonymously during her lifetime. Austen also had troubles
with her publisher, who wanted to make alterations to her love scenes
in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. In 1811 he wrote to Thomas Egerton:
"You say the book is indecent. You say I am immodest. But Sir in the
depiction of love, modesty is the fullness of <i>truth</i>; and
decency frankness; and so I must also be frank with you, and ask that
you remove my name from the title page in all future printings; 'A
lady' will do well enough."</p>
      <p>At her death on July 18, 1817 in
Winchester, at the age of forty-one, Austen was writing the unfinished <span style="font-style: italic;">Sanditon</span>.
She managed to write twelve chapters before stopping in March 18, due
to her poor health. The cause of her death is not known. It has been
claimed that Austen was a victim of Addison's disease. According to
Claire Tomalin, she may have died of lymphoma. Katherine White has
suggested in the British Medical Journal's Medical Humanities magazine,
that she died of tuberculosis caught from cattle. </p>


<p>Jane Austen was buried in Winchester Cathedral, near the centre of
the north aisle. "It is a satisfaction to me to think that [she is] to
lie in a Building she admired so much," Cassandra Austen wrote later.
Cassandra destroyed many of her sister's letters; one hundred sixty
survived but none written earlier than her tentieth birthday. </p>
<p>Jane Austen's brother Henry made her authorship public after her death.  <i>Emma</i>
had been reviewed favorably by Sir Walter Scott, who wrote in his
journal of March 14, 1826: "[Miss Austen] had a talent for describing
the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is
to me the most wonderful I have ever met with. The Big Bow-Wow strain I
can do myself like any now going; but the exquisite touch, which
renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting, from
the truth of the description and the sentiment, is denied to me."
Charlotte Brontë and E.B. Browning found her limited, and Elizabeth
Hardwick said: "I don't think her superb intelligence brought her
happiness." It was not until the publication of J.E. Austen-Leigh's <i>Memoir</i> in 1870 that a Jane Austen cult began to develop. Austen's unfinished <i>Sanditon</i>
came out in 1925. Nearly every word she ever wrote has been published,
including scrapbooks of her teenage bagatelles,&nbsp; fragments, and
letters. <br>
