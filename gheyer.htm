<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->British writer who published about 40 
historical novels <font face="Symbol">-</font> Regency romances <font face="Symbol">-</font>
and a dozen detective novels from the 1930s to the 1950s. Georgette
Heyer's best known detective characters are Superintendent Hannasyde
and Inspector Hemingway. Her Regency novels meticulously recreated the
period in the smallest detail of social code, dress, food, and
language. Heyer also wrote short stories and a radio play from her own
novel. </p>
<blockquote><font color="white" size="2"><b>--</b></font><font size="2"><b>"Am I cold?" </b></font><b><br>
<font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2">"At the bottom, yes. It is not so?" </font><br>
<font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2">"Certainly it is so. It's unfashionable to possess a heart."</font><br>
<font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2">"Oh, Philippe, thou art a rogue." </font><br>
<font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2">"So I have been
told. Presumably because I am innocent of the slightest indiscretion.
Curious. No one dubs you rogue who so fully merit the title. But I,
whose reputation is spotless, am necessarily a wicked one and a
deceiver. I shall write a sonnet on the subject." </font></b><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Transformation of Philip Jettan</font></i><font size="2">, 1923</font><font size="2">) </font><font size="2"></font></blockquote>

<p>Georgette Heyer was born in Wimbledon, the daughter of George Heyer,
a teacher at King's
College School, and Sylvia Watkins, whose father owned tugboats on the
River Thames. She was educated at seminary schools and Westminster
College, London,
but never passed any form of examination. Heyer's father died of a heat
attack after a game of tennis with George Ronald Rougier, her fiancé.
They married in 1925, a few months after his death. Rouguier was a
mining engineer, and Heyer moved with him for three years to East
Africa, where she wrote the essay 'The Horned Beats of Africa',
published in <i>The Sphere</i>
in 1929. From 1928 to 1929 they lived in Yugoslavia. After settling in
England George Rougier quit his job. For some years he run a sports
shop in Horsham in Sussex and then he pursued a career as barrister. He
was called to the Bar in 1939. Their son, Richard, born in 1932, also
became a barrister and a colorful High Court judge, who earned a
reputation as a hard-liner in a series of prominent criminal cases in
the 1990s. He died in 2007. In the 1942 the Heyers moved from Sussex to
London. During the war, Heyer reviewed books for her publisher,
Heinemann. </p>
<p>Her first novel, <em>The Black Moth</em> (1921), Heyer wrote at the
age of 17 to amuse her sick brother Boris. Heyer's father had
encouraged her to send it to an agent and eventually it was published
by Constable, London, and Houghton Mifflin, Boston when she was
nineteen. The opening words already revel Heyer's strength and lifelong
fascination with details: "Glad in his customary black and silver, with
raven hair unpowdered and elaborately dressed, diamonds on his fingers
and in his cravat, Hugh Tracy Clare Bermanoir, Duke of Andover, sat at
the escritoire in the library of his town house, writing." </p><p><em>The Transformation of Philip Jettan</em>
(1923) came out under the name Stella Martin and later under her own
name. Rougier is said to have devised plots to several of his wife's
mysteries. Heyer's accurate knowledge of the legal system is seen in <em>Duplicate Death</em> (1951). The motive of the murderer is in many cases acquisition of an 
inheritance. Usually Heyer set her stories in the English village milieu or in the social circles of London. In <em>The Grant Sophy</em> (1950) the protagonist arrives in London to find a husband. She lacks beauty <font face="Symbol">-</font> so she thinks <font face="Symbol">-</font> and she has a mind of her own. However, Heyer always found suitable husbands for her heroines. 
 </p>

<p>Although Heyer's early works were swashbuckling adventure stories,
the great majority of her novels are historical romances. They offer
much information about the costume, social customs, and forms of speech
of the era &#8211; these are the traits for which her books are still read
and admired today. Her historical romances were well researched, and in
addition to her large reference library, Heyer had a good memory; she
rarely made mistakes. Thus, when she found out that <a href="bcartlan.htm">Barbara Cartland</a> 's&nbsp;<em>Knave of Hearts</em> (1950) had similarities with her<em> These Old Shades</em>
(1926), she was&nbsp;absolute sure that Cartland had copied
&nbsp;names, characters and plot details from her novel without
attribution to her. <em>Knave of Hearts</em> was reissued in the United States under a new title, <em>The Innocent Heiress</em> (1970), and a heading: "In the tradition of Georgette Heyer".</p>
<p><em>An Infamous Army</em>&nbsp;(1937) showed Heyer's skill as a war historian. The Regency comedies sometimes used elements from crime stories, as in <em>The Corinthian</em> (1940), or spy fiction, as in <span class="st"><em>The Reluctant Widow</em> </span>(1946). In later period she produced works which had humor and irony, and dealt with family relationships. In&nbsp;<em>Beauvallet</em>
(1929) an English buccaneer harassing Spanish ships under Queen
Elizabeth is distracted by his love for a Spanish Protestant
noblewoman. <span class="st"><em>The Talisman Ring</em> </span>(1936), which combines romance with murder, depicts a murder suspect, who meets a woman fleeing an arranged marriage. In <em>Faro's Daughter</em> (1941) the heroine runs a gaming salon.&nbsp; <em>Frederica</em> (1965) centers on the initiation of an outsider aristocratic male into a domestic world of family relationships. </p>
<p>Four of Heyer's classical style mysteries feature Superintendent Hannasyde, <em>Death in the Stocks</em> (1935), <em>Behold, Here's Poison!</em>&nbsp;(1936), <em>They Found Him Dead</em>&nbsp;(1937), <em>A Blunt Instrument</em> (1938). His associate, Inspector Hemingway, features also in four,<em> <font size="2"></font>No Wind of Blame</em> (1939), <em>Envious Casca</em> (1941), <i>Duplicate Death</i> (1951), <em>Detection Unlimited</em>&nbsp;(1953). </p>

<p>Heyer's immense popularity and success embroiled her in tax problems
from which she tried to escape by producing more books. From the
beginning of her career, she refused to give interviews. Heyer also
published short stories, and two articles on literary topics, 'Books
About the Brontës' and 'How to Be a Literary Critic', both of which
appeared in <i>Punch </i>in
1954. Her last major projects included the trilogy of John, Duke of
Bedford, brother of Henry V. This magnum opus was never finished.
Georgette Heyer died of lung cancer on July 4, 1974. The first volume
was prepared for publication by her husband, who died on the following
year. </p>

<p>As her own model Heyer mentioned 
<a href="jausten.htm">Jane Austen</a>, with whom she shared the same
the ironic tone. Often the fast paced and ironic dialogue contrasted
attitudes and roles of her female and male characters. Her Regency
romances have been criticized for their conventional plots and
"escapist" qualities or, alternatively, acclaimed for historical
accuracy and authenticity
of the dialogue and slang. The feminist novelist Brigid Brophy
characterized Heyer's <em>False Colour</em> (1963) in <i>New Statesman</i> as "a piece of childish let's-pretend but blessedly unpretentious" and "nimble to the point of wit in copying period detail." <font face="Times New Roman"></font>Elaine Bander described Heyer as attractive, unusually tall, intellectually arrogant, and caustic" <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Great Women Mystery Writers</font></i><font size="2">, ed. Kathleen Gregory Klein, 1994)</font>. <font face="Times New Roman">Feminist critics have noted that Heyer's spirited heroines 
are "tamed" at the end by the love of a good man. </font>Often
her women concentrate entirely on the business of getting married like
Austen's heroines, and they show intelligence and and strong will.
Heyer's work have influenced such novelists as Jane Aiken Hodge, the
daughter of <a href="caiken.htm">Conrad Aiken</a> 
and sister of Joan Aiken. The of her books have been filmed, <i>The Reluctand Widow </i>in 1950 and <i>Arabella</i> in 1959.</p>
