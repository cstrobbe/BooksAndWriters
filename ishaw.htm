      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific American playwright,
screenwriter,
and author of international bestsellers, of which the best-known is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Young Lions</span> (1948), one of the
most famous novels about World War II. Shaw's <span style="font-style: italic;">Rich Man, Poor Man</span>
(1970) inspired a popular television mini-series. Critics have
generally agreed that Shaw was a masterful storyteller, but also
observed that his commercial fiction hurt his literary reputation. As a
short story writer with the skill to create memorable characters Shaw
have been compared to Hemingway, John Cheever, and John O'Hara. His
books have sold over 14 million copies. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He waved to the accordionist, who
went into the opening chords of </b></font><b><i><font size="2">Deutschland,
Deutscheland über Alles</font></i><font size="2">.
This was the first time Margaret had ever heard the song sung in
Austria, but she had learned it from a German maid when she was five.
She still remembered the words and she sang with them, feeling drunk
and intelligent and international."</font></b><font size="2"> (from</font><i><font size="2"> The Young Lions</font></i><font size="2">, 1948) </font> </blockquote>
      <p>Irwin Shaw was born Irwin Gilbert Shamforoff in Bronx in New
York to
Jewish immigrants from Russia. His parents, William Shamforoff, a
salesman, and Rose (Tompkins) Shamforoff, changed their family's name
to Shaw and moved to Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, where the
young Irwin spent most of his childhood. He was educated at the
Brooklyn College, where he played football, and graduated with a B.A.
in 1934. During these years Shaw wrote for the school newspaper. At the
age of 21, Shaw started his career as a writer by producing scripts for
radio shows and adapting among episodes for "Dick Tracy". With Peter
Viertel he wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The Survivors</span>,
which was produced and directed Martin Gabel. Reviews were bad and the
production was closed. Shaw's first play, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bury the Dead</span>,
an anti-war story in which six soldiers killed in battle rise up, was
produced in the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York in 1936. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">I Want You</span>
(1951), a film based on Shaw's screenplay and directed by Mark Robson,
was called by Penelope Housten as a "recruiting picture which seems to
accept a third world war almost as a present reality." </p>
      <p>Shaw's co-operation with experimental Group Theatre continued
in 1939 with <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gentle People</span>,
which has been filmed four times. <span style="font-style: italic;">Talk
of the Town</span>
(1942), for which Shaw wrote the screenplay with Sidney Buchman,
received several Academy Award nominations, among them the best picture
and the script. The film, directed by George Stevens and starring
Roland Colman, Gary Grant, and Jean Arthur, was a comedy about civil
liberties with a lynching mob climax. The original story was written by
Sidney Harmon. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Commandos Strike
at Dawn</span> (1943), directed by John Farrow, was based on a story by
      <a href="forester">C.S. Forester</a>, which told about Norwegian
commandos struggling against the Nazis. In 1946 Shaw's play <span style="font-style: italic;">The Assassin </span>closed
early due to negative critics and he abandoned playwriting for years.
Between the years 1947 and 1948 he contributed drama critics to <i>New
Republic</i>, Washington D.C. </p>
      <p>In the late 1930s Shaw wrote pieces for such magazines as <i>The
New Yorker</i> and<i> Esquire</i>. These "socially conscious" stories
were gathered in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sailor off the
Bremen</span> (1939) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Welcome to
the City</span>
(1942), which contain some of his best works, including 'The Sailor off
the Bremen,' about a struggle between an American athlete and a Nazi
sailor, 'The Girls in their Summer Dresses,' about an unhappy marriage,
'Second Mortgage,' and 'The Eighty-Yard Run,' about the fragility of
success. "Nineteen twenty-nine came to Darling and to his wife and
father-in-law, the maker of inks, just as it came to everyone else. The
father-in-law waited until 1933 and then blew his brains out and when
Darling went to Chicago to see what the books of the firm looked like
he found out all that was left were debts and three or four gallons of
unbought ink." (from 'The Eighty-Yard Run') Now Shaw's stories are
considered 20th-century American classics and as enduring as those by
John Cheever, John O'Hara, and J.D. Salinger. They influenced among
others the famous screenwriter William Goldman, who wrote before his
breakthroug with the film <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>:
"... for me, Shaw and Fitzgerald are the great American stylists" (<i>Which
Lie Did I Tell</i>,
2000). Goldman met Shaw in New York, wanted to tell him what he meant,
and then said: "It's easy for you, isn't it, the writing?" "It wasn't
easy," Shaw said, whose disciplined existence according to his friend
Peter Viertel centered on his writing throughout his life. </p>
      <p>During World War II, Shaw served in the U.S. Army, becoming a
warrant officer. The director William Wyler had wanted to attach Shaw
to his unit as his writer, but Shaw turned him down. "After sober
reflection," he cabled to Wyler, "I've decided that going with you as a
private would mean a long succession of frustrations... So I'm going
into the regular army this morning at 645." Ironically, the Army
shipped Shaw first to the Signal Corps picture unit at the converted
Paramount studios in Queens, New York. In wartime London Shaw had an
affair with Mary Wells, the <i>Time</i>
reporter. Shaw introduced her to Ernest Hemingway; they were married in
1946. Shaw also served in North Africa and witnessed the liberation of
Paris as a member of documentary film unit. </p>
      <p>In 1947-48 Shaw was an instructor in creative writing at New
York
University. Shaw's war experiences in Europe gave basis for his novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Young Lions</span> (1948), which
gained an international success. This<span style="font-style: italic;">
      </span>a
panorama of the conflict in Europe was told from the perspectives of
one German and two American soldiers. William Goldman later argued that
critics never forgave Shaw for the success of the novel. When a
reviewer compared the book favorably with <i>War and Peace</i>, the
praise enraged Hemingway who referred to Shaw in a letter as a
"Brooklyn Tolstoy". Shaw dismissed the remark saying, "Papa doesn't
like anyone to invade what he considers his literary terrain, war". </p>
      <p>In the film version, directed by Edward Dmytryk, Montgomery
Clift
played a sensitive Jew who eventually becomes a war hero. Dean Martin
was a frustrated Hollywood draft dodger, and Marlon Brando was casted
as Christian, a Nazi officer. The screenplay was written by Edward
Anhalt. Clift complained that it did not bear resemblance to Shaw's
novel. The author himself later said that Monty was "bitter as I was at
the deformation of the book. But he was superb &#8211; the best and truest to
the character I'd written."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Marlon
Brando wanted to die at the end dramatically, arms outstretched like a
Christ figure, and Clift promised that if Brando tries it, he will walk
off the picture. <i>The Young Lions</i> did moderately well at the box
office. The <i>Tribune </i>wrote, "Montgomery Clift is superb in his
inarticulate anguish as he walks with his girl's father who has never
met a Jew." The <i>Times</i>
had completely reverse view: "Clift's performance is strangely hollow
and lackluster as the sensitive Jew. He acts throughout the picture as
if he were in a glassy-eyed daze..." </p>
      <p>Shaw's second novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Troubled Air </span>(1951),
was about the rise of McCarthyism. With the publication of the work,
Shaw left the United States, living 25 years in Europe in such
locations as Paris, the Riviera, and Swiss resorts. For more than
thirty years, he went skiing to Klosters, which also attracted a number
of Hollywood stars and directors, including Gene Kelly, Kirk Douglas,
Stanley Donen, and Sam Spiegel. When William Wyler took his family
skiing in the Swiss Alps, he met there John Huston and his latest wife,
Robert Parrish, the Viertels, and Irwin Shaw and his wife Marianne, who
had been one of Busby Berkely's dancing girls before her marriage. Shaw
preferred the self-contained and beautiful Marianne to other women, but
once complained that "nothing ever happened to a man while he was
traveling with his wife". During this period Shaw wrote screenplay for
such films as <span style="font-style: italic;">Fire Down Below</span>
(1957), <span style="font-style: italic;">Desire Under the Elms</span>
(1958), based on <a href="oneill.htm">Eugene O'Neill</a>'s play, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Big Gamble</span> (1961), and<span style="font-style: italic;"> In the French Style</span> (1963), which
he also also co-produced. Shaw's idea was to ask Rita Hayworth for <i>Fire
Down Below</i>,
also starring Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon, when the producers failed
to get Ava Gardner. The film was promoted as a Hayworth comeback, but
her performance suffered in comparison with <i>Gilda </i>(1946). </p>
      <p>In Europe Shaw continued with several bestsellers, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Two Weeks in Another Town</span> (1960)
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Evening in Byzantium</span>
(1973), which depicted a Hollywood producer who goes to Cannes to test
his screenplay. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rich Man, Poor Man </span>(1970)
told a modern Kain and Abel story. It follows an upstate New York
family and takes the reader from the post-war years to new ideas and
trends of the present. In 1975 the book was adapted into a pioneering
mini-series, starring Nick Nolte, Peter Strauss, and William Smith as
their deadly nemesis, Falconetti, in the first 12 episodes. An enormous
but somewhat unexpected hit, the series received three Emmy Awards,
which went to Ed Asner, Fionnula Flanagan, and the director David
Greene. Strauss played an ambitious politician, Rudy, and Nolte was his
wild brother, who eventually gains happiness in his life. (Susan
Blakely: "It's just amazing how he has changed." Peter Strauss:
"Haven't we all?" Blakely: "Yes, but he's changed for the better.")
Nolte is killed at the end of the last episode by Falconetti.<font size="2"> </font>The story was continued in <i>Rich Man, Poor Man:
Book Two </i>(1976),
but did not rise to the level of the first production. 'The Girls in
Their Summer Dresses' was produced for television in 1981, along with
'The Man Who Married a French Wife' and 'The Monument'. </p>
      <p><i>Two Weeks in Another Town</i> is the story of Jack Andrus,
a
Hollywood star and an alcoholic, at the crossroads. In the course of
two weeks he is forced to relieve his past in the international film
colony in Rome. There Andrus encounters his old wife Carlotta, and a
new mistress, the young and beautiful Veronica. There is also his
former friend, the brilliant and corrupt movie director who put Andrus
on top, then helped to destroy him. The film version from 1962 was
directed by Vincente Minnelli, starring Kirk Douglas, Cyd Charisse,
Edward G. Robinson. Minnelli shot most of it in Rome, where <i>Cleopatra</i>
took all the attention. Edward G. Robinson played the movie director,
who gives Jack Andrus (Kirk Douglas) another chance. The film had some
scandalous scenes &#8211; in one a group of people sit drinking in a
nightclub, watching a sexual act being performed off screen. However,
most provocative shots were cut out. "I felt this was such an injustice
to Vincente Minnelli, who'd done a wonderful job with the film. And an
injustice to the paying public, who could have had the experience of
watching a very dramatic, meaningful film."<font size="2"> (Kirk
Douglas in </font><i><font size="2">The Ragman's Son</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font> </p>
      <blockquote><b>"<font size="2">That is," Jack read, "an American,
starting at any given point, believes that his career must go from
success to success. In the American artist, of any kind, it is the
equivalent of the optimistic businessman's greed of the continually
expanding economy. The intermittent failure, the cadenced rise and fall
of the level of a man's work, which is accepted and understood by the
European artist, is fiercely rejected as a normal picture of the
process of creation. A dip is not a dip to an American artist, it is a
descent into an abyss, an offence against his native </font><i><font size="2">moeurs </font></i><font size="2">and
his compatriots' most dearly held beliefs. In America, the normal
incidence of failure, either real or imagined, private or public, which
must be expected in such a chancy and elusive endeavor as writing
novels or putting on plays or directing motion pictures in regarded,
even by the artist himself, as evidence of guilt, as self-betrayal.</font><font size="2">" </font></b><font size="2">(from<i> Two Weeks in Another
Town</i>, 1960) </font> </blockquote>
      <p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Acceptable Loses</span>
(1982)
a small incident changes the life of the protagonist. Roger Damon, a
literary agent, receives a mysterious telephone call. It starts Damon's
self-examination, in which he must face his past and his mistakes. Shaw
used similar plot invention also in the earlier novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Bread Upon the Waters </span>(1981).
A rich lawyer starts to fulfill the wishes of an ordinary family, but
his generosity has also unforeseen consequences. "In essence, then, <i>Bread
Upon the Water</i>
is a summation of what Mr. Shaw has learned to date about the world
surrounding him and the people who inhabit it. He has learned a great
deal and has thoughtfully assimilated it. In today's critical climate,
the word ''professional'' has taken on negative overtones. Irwin Shaw
is a thorough professional, a word used here with admiration and
respect."<font size="2"> (Evan Hunter in </font><i><font size="2">The
New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">August
23, 1981) </font></p>
      <p>Shaw received several award, including O Henry awards for
'Walking
Wounded' (1944) and 'Gunner's Passage' (second prize, 1945), National
Institute of Arts and Letters grant (1946), and Playboy award (1964,
1970, 1979). In 1976 he left France and began a dual residency in
Southampton, Long Island, and Klosters, Switzerland. Shaw died on May
16, 1984 in Davos, Switzerland. </p>
