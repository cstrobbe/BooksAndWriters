<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Czech playwright and poet, one of
the leading intellectual figures and moral forces in Eastern Europe,
who was elected President of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic in
1989 and in 1993 President of the newly formed Czech Republic. Václav
Havel's role as a public figure somewhat overshadowed his record as a
dramatist and political essayist. His work often dealt with the power
of language to interfere with clear thought. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There are no exact guidelines. There are
probably no guidelines at all. The only thing I can recommend at this
stage is a sense of humor, an ability to see things in their ridiculous
and absurd dimensions, to laugh at others and at ourselves, a sense of
irony regarding everything that calls out for parody in this world. In
other words, I can only recommend perspective and distance. Awareness
of all the most dangerous kinds of vanity, both in others and in
ourselves. A good mind. A modest certainty about the meaning of things.
Gratitude for the gift of life and the courage to take responsibility
for it. Vigilance of spirit." </b>(Havel upon receiving the Open Society Prize awarded by the Central European University in 1999, tr. Paul Wilson) </font></blockquote>
<p>Václav Havel was born into a well-to-do family in Prague. His father
owned Prague's cliff-top Barrandov suburb and his mother, Bozena
Havlova, the daughter of an ambassador and journalist, encouraged her
son's intellectual and artistic ambitions. In his youth he formed a
literary circle called Thirty-Sixers, after the year of its members'
birth. Because of his 'bourgeois' background he was denied the right to
attend university. At the age of fifteen, Havel became interested in
poetry. With the future film director Milos Forman he visited the poet <a href="jseifert.htm">Jaroslav Seifert</a>,
who read his first texts. Although Kafka's literary heritage was nearly
buried by the authorities, his works deeply influenced Havel.</p>
<p>In 1951-55 Havel worked as a laboratory technician. He studied at a
technical college (1955-57) and served in the Czechoslovak Army
(1957-59). Havel had joined Group 42, and after challenging the older
generation of writers in their magazine <i>Kveten </i>(May), he was
for the first time noticed as a writer. In 1964 Havel married Olga
&#352;plíchalová (1933-1996). They bought a small farm near the Polish
border, where the happy couple was visited by a number of their
friends. After his wife's death Havel married in 1997 an actress, the
former Dagmar Veskrnova,&nbsp;who has had a good number of roles both
in feature films and on TV. </p>
<p>In the 1960s Havel made his way in the theater, first as a
stagehand, and then becoming resident writer for the Prague "Theatre on
the Balustrade" from 1960 to 1969. During this time he continued his
education at the Prague Academy of Art. His first play as the dramatic
consultant of the theater Na Zábradlí, <i>The Garden Party </i>(1963),
was a satire of modern bureaucratic routines. This work, which
challenged communist hegemony, was a success both at home and abroad.
In the footsteps of <a href="gorwell.htm">George Orwell </a>Havel
became interested in language &#8211; in the play the protagonist acquires an
"official" language and rises to bureaucratic fame. Havel was
subsequently enrolled at the Academy of Dramatic Arts and he graduated
in 1967. A few years earlier he had joined the editorial board of the
literary magazine <i>Tvár</i>, which was soon in conflict with the
conservative Writers' Association. Václav Klaus, who later became
Havel's successor as president of the Czech Republic, contibuted
articles on economics for the magazine. <i>Tvár </i>ceased to appear
in 1969. In the same year Havel's passport was confiscated. His satires
of communist bureaucracy were considered subversive.</p>
<p>As a playwright Havel used dramatic techniques to make situations or characters seem ridiculous. In <i>The Memorandum</i>
(1965) he introduced an artificial language that is supposed to allow
for greater precision in communication. The absurd attempt results in a
complete breakdown of human relationships. Three years later the theme
was taken even further in <i>The Increased Difficulty of Concentration</i>
(1968), in which Havel attacked fashionable sociological terminology.
1968. In the 1970s Havel wrote a series of one-act plays, <i>Audience</i> (1978), <i>Private View </i>(1978), and <i>Protest</i>
(1978), in which the protagonist is a dissident playwright in trouble
with the authorities. Most plays from this period are built around the
writer Vanék, who faces the absurd realities of Czech life. </p>
<p>Havel supported the Prague Spring reform movement of 1968, though he
did not play a major role. After it was crushed by Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact forces in August, Havel took on a more visible role in activism.
When Milan Kundera praised his compatriots' passive response to the
invasion, Havel urged his readers to act. His letter to the Czech
President Gustav Husák <font face="Symbol">-</font> the popular party 
secretary Alexander Dubcek had been expelled &#8211; was not officially censored, and copies of 
its text spread widely. Havel was a cofounder of the human rights organization Charter 77 and the 
Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS). His works were banned by the hard-line 
government, but the manuscripts circulated privately and were printed in Western Europe. </p><p>It has 
been said, that if the Russians invented samizdat, the Czechs made it an art. The term <i>samizdat 
</i>("self-publication" in Russian) coined by Nikolai Glazkov in reference to a typewritten, bound copy of his poems, but the word 
gradually acquired a wider meaning as the "unofficial reproduction of unpublished manuscripts." 
From the early 1970s, Havel and other authors, such as Ivan Klíma, Pavel Kohout, and Ludvík Vaculík, 
began to exchange their manuscript, thus establishing the<i> Edice Petlice</i> (The Padlock Edition). 
By 1980, it consisted of some 200 volumes. Havel's samizdat press <i>Edice Expedice</i> (The Expedition Series) 
was continued by his wife and his brother while he was in prison <font size="2">
(see </font><font size="2"><i>Good-bye, Samizdat: Twenty Years of Czechoslovak Underground Writing 
</i>by Markéta Goetz-Stankiewicz, 1992 pp. xvi-xviii)</font>. Samizat publishers cooperatad with Czech émigre publishers in the West. </p>
<p>Havel's plays did much to bring world attention to the
Czechoslovakian struggle. Throughout this period he was subjected to
police harassment and arrests. In 1979 he was sentenced to four and a
half years imprisonment for subversion of the republic &#8211; he had
collected and published with his colleagues information about police
harassment. Vaculik, who escaped imprisonment, got in a quarrel with
Havel and others and became marginalized in the dissident movement.
Because of illness, Havel was released in 1983. Between the years 1987
and 1989 Havel was a member of the editorial board of the samizdat
newspaper <i>Lidové Noviny</i>, and a regular contributor.</p>
<p>A new period in the development of Havel's dramatic art started in
the 1980s. His plays reflected identity problems and philosophical
moral problems as in <i>Temptation</i> (1986), a modern reworking of Faust. In <i>Largo desolatio </i>(1985)
the hero, another writer character, finds it difficult to deal with the
burdens imposed on him both by his enemies and by his friends. The hero
no longer appears clearly as a "dissident". </p>
<p>As an essayist Havel carried on the tradition of democratic and
liberal thought. Unlike other dissident writers, Havel had no illusions
as to the humane nature of communism or the possibility of
democratization. At the same time, he denounced the egotism of the
consumer civilization of Western society <font face="Symbol">-</font> a theme familiar from the writings of Mary McCarthy. Like the famous Russian Nobel writer and dissident, <a href="alesol.htm">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>, Havel has underlined the moral revival of the individual in the change of the social order.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It has been our absolutely basic
historical experience that, in the long run, the only thing that can be
truly successful and meaningful politically must first and
foremost-that is, before it has taken any political form at all-be a
proper and adequate response to the fundamental moral dilemmas of the
time, or an expression of respect for the imperatives of the moral
order bequeathed to us by our culture. It is a very clear understanding
that the only kind of politics that truly makes sense is one that is
guided by conscience. "</b> (Havel in 1999) </font></blockquote>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s Havel was repeatedly arrested, and
Charter 77 and similar groups were isolated from Czechoslovak society.
Havel served several years in prison for his dissident activities
(1977, 1978-79, 1979-83, 1989). After the communist regime sentenced
Havel in 1979 to 4 1/2 years in prison for subversion, he was given the
opportunity to emigrate, but he chose imprisonment. In the 1980s Havel
became the undisputed unofficial leader of the Czechoslovak human
rights movement. <span style="font-style: italic;">Letters to Olga</span> (1983) was written in a kind of code. "There are parts of it I don't understand myself," Havel later said. <br>
</p><p>Shortly&nbsp;after the Fall of the Berlin Wall in November
1989,&nbsp;Havel formed&nbsp;a new opposition group, Civic
Forum,&nbsp;at a meeting in Prague's Magic Lantern theater,&nbsp;but it
was students, who began the "Velvet Revolution." Alexander Dubcek
(1921-92), who had launched a series of reforms in 1968 and was
subsequently expelled from the Presidium, was&nbsp;nominated chairman
of the parliament. Havel was elected in 1989 by direct popular vote
President of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, following Gustav
Husák, who died in 1991. Husák's Precidency lasted 14 years
&#8211;&nbsp;noteworthy, Havel spent in office 14 years, too. </p>
<p>When Havel traveled to London, he wanted to meet the author Salman
Rushdie, who had been forced into hiding after Iran's spiritual leader
Ayatollah Khomeini had ordered his assassination. Their meeting at the
Czech embassy was cancelled.&nbsp; "I do not trust the place," Havel
explained on the phone. "There are still many people of old regime,
many strange people wandering about, many colonels." <br>
</p>
      <p>Havel's first great defeat was the 1992 break-up of
Czechoslovakia. He resigned but was elected president of the new Czech
Republic in February 1993. Havel's mission in his office was to restore
a healthy democracy in his country, but his "non-political" politics
was also met with criticism. "The worst thing is that we live in a
contaminated moral environment," Havel had already said in his 1990 New
Year's speech, which shocked most listeners. "We fell morally ill
because we became used to saying something different from what we
thought." Havel promoted reconciliation with Germany, and lobbied for
the Czech's Republic's entry into Nato and the European Union. </p>
<p>In his address at the Nato summit on April 23, 1999, Havel stated:
"The fact that a former powerful strategic adversary has disappeared
from the scene does not, however, mean that in the world of today human
lives, human rights, human dignity and the freedom of nations are no
longer in danger. They are, unfortunately, still being threatened, and
collective defence of the democratic states of the Euro-Atlantic sphere
of civilization, therefore, still remains a valid concept." To his
critics, who claimed that he had learned to like power a little too
much, Havel said that as soon as his homeland does not need him, "I
will with great appetite devote myself to my original profession." </p>
<p>Václav Klaus, who served as prime minister from 1992 to 1997,
carried the responsibility of economic reforms of the country.
Eventually Wednesday meetings with Klaus, a strong-willed advocate of
the free market economy, turned into a nightmarish experience for
Havel. When Havel invited Salman Rushdie to the Prague Castle, Klaus
accused Havel of risking the country's security concerns. Before
stepping down as President, Havel became the target of smear campaigns
by the tabloid media and he was criticized by communists. However, he
remained for most citizens in his country among the most popular
politicians. </p><p>In 2006 Havel accepted a residency at Columbia University, where he wrote much of his autobiography, <i>To the Castle and Back </i>(2006). Havel's first play in nearly 20 years, <i>Leaving</i>
(2007), told the story of Dr. Vilem Rieger, the former chancellor of an
unnamed country, whose world collapses around him after he leaves
politics. When mass demonstrations broke out in Egypt in late January
2011, Havel said in an interview, that "President [Hosni] Mubarak,
who's done a lot for Egypt, should acknowledge that his time has come
and step down right away." </p><p>Havel died&nbsp;of respiratory
disease on 18 December, 2011, at the age of 75,&nbsp;at his country
home in Hradecek. A week before his death, he had met his friend His
Holiness&nbsp;the Dalai Lama in Prague, and signed with him&nbsp;a
declaration in support of dissidents. In a letter addressed to&nbsp;the
conference on Democracy and Human Rights in Asia, one of his last
public statements,<strong> </strong>Havel&nbsp;said that "one of the
great mistakes of politics today&nbsp;. . . is the superimposing of
economic interests over everything else; and the fact that attitudes
towards different conflicts and problems in today&#8217;s world are being
distorted by the misappropriation of those spiritual values, which form
the foundation of our society." </p><blockquote><b><font size="2">For further reading:</font></b> <i><font size="2">Vaclav Havel: A Political Tragedy in Six Acts</font></i><font size="2"> by John Keane (2000); </font><i><font size="2">Encyclopedia of World Literature in the 20th Century</font></i><font size="2">, Vol. 2, ed.
