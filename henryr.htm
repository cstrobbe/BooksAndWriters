<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American author, whose best-known work is <span style="font-style: italic;">Call It Sleep</span>
(1934), a classic in Jewish-American literature. Critical reactions to
the novel were positive, but as a result of the Depression, Roth's
publisher went bankrupt and the book disappeared from view. It was
reissued in the 1960s and recognized belatedly as an important novel of
the 1930s. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"... no one has ever distilled such
poetry and wit from the counterpoint between maimed English and the
subtle Yiddish of the immigrant. No one has reproduced so sensitively
the terror of family life in the imagination of a child caught between
two cultures." </b>(Leslie A. Fiedler) </font></blockquote>
<p>Henry Roth was born in Tysmenica, Galicia, Austria-Hungary. His
father was a waiter. Roth moved in 1907 with his mother to New York,
where his father was already living. From 1908 to 1910 Roth's Yiddish-
speaking family lived in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and in
1910 they moved to the Lower East Side, "a virtual Jewish mini-state",
as Roth later noted, and four years later to Harlem, an Irish and
Italian neighborhood. Roth graduated from the City College of New York.
During his college years he started to write. Roth was encouraged by
the poet and professor of English literature Eda Lou Walton, 12 years
his senior, with whom he lived in her Grenwich Village house. There he
met such writers as Hart Crane and Margaret Mead. </p>
<p><i>Call It Sleep </i>received moderate critical praise and went soon out of print and was forgotten. The story
 recorded six years in the life  of a Jewish immigrant boy, a six- to eight-year-old David Schearl, in a 
New York ghetto just prior to World War I. David is shielded by his loving mother. His life turns in a nightmare 
when his paranoid father is unable to hold a job. David's father is tormented by his lack of success and he becomes 
increasingly menacing to the son, and is finally convinced that David is not his son. After he has survived a deathly 
initiation game, David closes his eyes, with his mother beside him, and "one might as well call 
it sleep." </p>
<p><i>Call It Sleep </i>was influenced by <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>
and T. S. Eliot, and brought among the first an interior monologue into
American literature. The reader learns about the world of the
immigrants' Lower East Side from the boy's vantage point &#8211; David's
oedipal conflicts and his encounter of anti-Semitism on the streets,
neighborhood gangs of non-Jewish youths, and an early introduction to
sex, which terrifies David. Roth used in an extremely impressive way
dialect, broken, misspelled English, mispronounced words of the street
boys, the dialects of Irish policeman and Italian street sweeper, and
the language of David's mind. </p>
<p>The novel was dismissed by the leftist <i>New Masses</i> which
complained that it's "a pity that so many young writers drawn from the
proletariat can make no better use of their working class experience
than as material for introspective and febrile novels." Roth had joined
the Communist Party in 1933, but found that he could not write his
works in the true spirit of class struggle. As a consequence, <i>Call It Sleep</i>
was not praised for its social critic. Roth was more concerned with the
psychological development of his characters, Freud's ideas, and
linguistic considerations. However, the work has been hailed by some
critics as one of the finest works of proletarian novel, although Roth
did not particularly focus on the sufferings of the working class. </p>
<p>Later Roth stated in interviews that he suffered from both the
political pressures on his writing and from his life with Walton, who
was much older than him, and gave him literary and financial support
during the Depression. Roth considered that because of this experience
he never gained an independence and could never get beyond the level of
the talented protége in his writing.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You're licked. Your wife knows you're
licked. She said so long ago, she said when you asked her do you think
I'll ever write again, Honestly, what do you think? She said, after
weighing the thought: No, I don't think so, hon."</b> (from an unpublished manuscript, </font><font size="2"><i>New York Times</i>, </font><font size="2">August 15, 1993) </font></blockquote>
<p>After his first novel Roth started his second, an autobiographical
work. It was intended to please the Communist Party but Roth destroyed
it in the beginning. In the 1940's Roth burned his journals and
manuscripts. He published no more novels until 1994, going through a
very long writer's. During this time Roth worked in several jobs, among
others as a precision metal grinder, mental nurse, poultry farmer, and
teacher. Roth married Muriel Parker, a pianist and composer, in 1939.
The marriage lasted 51 years &#8211; she died in 1990. Since 1946 they lived
in Maine and New Mexico. In the late 1960s Roth began writing again and
received a grant from the American Academy. He held the D.H. Lawrence
Fellowship at the University of New Mexico, living during his tenure on
the <a href="dhlawren.htm">Frieda Lawrence</a> ranch in Taos. <i>Call It Sleep </i>was reissued in paperback in 1964. It sold a million copies, and  the Roths  eventually settled to Albuquerque. </p>
<p>Roth published in 1987 a collection of short stories. The first volume of his second novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercy of a Rude Stream</span>,
came out in 1994. The title was taken from Shakespeare's play Henry
VIII. Written over many years from 1979 and fusing disparate material,
this multivolume work was received with mixed reviews. Roth once stated
that the novel is not autobiographical but it had much parallels with
his own life. The story is set in the 1920s. Ira Stigman's family moves
from the Jewish East Side to then an Irish neighborhood at East 114th
Street in Harlem &#8211; like Roth's. The young Ira has problems with his
emerging sexuality &#8211; "... couldn't he get it through his thick head
that ladies wanted to be laid?" Ira thinks, when he divides his time
between Edith Welles, an English professor, and his teen-age cousin
Stella. But Ira has also another kind of thoughts, questions such as
"What was human life striving after?" and he develops an idea that "if
you could put words to what you felt, it was yours." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Ira wept, numberless times. And he
grieved over the lessening pages that brought him nearer the end of his
companionship with Jean Valjean -- to the end of the book that he kept
under his bed in the little dark bedroom, that he woke up to on
Saturday and Sunday as to a precious gift waiting for him to reclaim
it. He tarried and reread, dreamed. Hundreds of new words lurked within
the pages, unfamiliar words within the hundreds of pages of narrative,
and yet they offered no obstacle to understanding..."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Mercy of a Rude Stream</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">A Diving Rock on the Hudson</span>
(1995) Roth used observations from his own life and continued the story
of the tortured hero Ira Stigman. The narrative follows Ira's school
years and his introduction to the literary world. Ira confesses to his
computer, Ecclesias, that he started at the age of 14 an incestuous
relationship with his younger sister Minnie &#8211; it was for him a crucial
act to break the boundaries of conventionality. Mary Gordon wrote in <i>New York Times</i>: "Part of the 
fascination of <i>A Diving Rock on the Hudson </i>is that it is a deliberately unflattering self-portrait of the garrulity and 
narcissism of old age. This is something we haven't seen before in literature, and if for no other reason, it is valuable as 
the speech of a tribe until now silenced." <font size="2">(February 26, 1995)</font> Roth died on October 1995, and the 
third volume of the intended six-volume series, less autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">From Bondage</span>, appeared posthumously in 1996. Roth's last novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">An American Type</span>, mostly about Ira Stigman's bohemian life in the 1930s, 
was not published until 2010. The 1,900 page manuscript, which Roth  wrote with a word processor, 
was edited by  Willing Davidson, who rearranged 
the material in chronological order. </p>
