<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Norwegian novelist, dramatist,
poet, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920. Knut Hamsun's
most famous novels include <em>Sult</em> (1890, The Hunger), an
intense story of a starving writer, which has attracted readers since
its publication in 1890. Before and during World War II the author
embraced the Nazi ideology. This separated Hamsun from other
intellectuals and writers who supported the Soviet Union and Stalin.
After the war Hamsun was consequently ostracized as a traitor. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"If one only had something to eat,
just a little, on such a clear day! The mood of the gay morning
overwhelmed me, I became unusually serene, and started to hum for pure
joy and for no particular reason. In front of a butcher's shop there
was a woman with a basket on her arm, debating about some sausage for
dinner; as I went past, she looked up at me. She had only a single
tooth in the lower jaw. In the nervous and excitable state I was on,
her face made an instant and revolting impression on me &#8211; the long
yellow tooth looked like a finger sticking out of her jaw, and as she
turned toward me, her eyes wee full of sausage. I lost my appetite
instantly, and felt nauseated."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Hunger</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Knut Hamsun was born in Lom in the Gudbrandsdalen Valley in
central Norway, the fourth son of Peder Petersen, a skilled itinerant
tailor, and Tora (Olsdatter Garmotraedet) Pedersen. When Hamsun was
three the family moved to the town of Hamarøy, some 100 miles north of
the Arctic Circle. There Peder Petersen took charge a farm, owned by
his brother-in-law Hans Olsen, who ran the village library and post
office. Olsen became a
victim of paralytic illness and claimed that the Pedersens owed him
money. Hamsun was not allowed to play with the other children but he
started to work for Olsen, keep the post office accounts,
and chop wood, to pay the debt to him,. Later Hamsun returned in his
works to his ill treatment &#8211; Olsen he called "red-bearded messenger of
death." </p>
      <p>During this period Hamsun turned to books to relieve his
feelings of loneliness. Apart from occasional attendance at a
travelling school, he had no other formal education. In 1873 Hamsun ran
away to Lom, where he was employed as an apprentice in a shop, and fell
in love with the shop owner's daughter. He returned to Hamarøy in the
following year, and held various jobs. With his friend he wandered in
Nordland and Tromssa as a peddler and tramp. His first work of fiction,
      <em>Den gaadefulde</em> (1877), appeared under the name of Knut
Pedersen Hamsund &#8211; he was eighteen years old. In 1884, after meeting
Mark Twain and writing an article on him, a printer's error dropped the
final 'd' on Hamsund. Hamsun accepted his new, accidentally born name. </p>
      <p>For the next year Hamsun taught school in Vesterålen, and
published his second novel, <em>Bjørger</em> (1878). With the support
of a wealthy merchant, Erasmus Zahl, he wrote in Hrdanger the novel <em>Frida.</em>
For his disappointment, it was in Copenhagen rejected by the publisher
Frederik Hegel. When he asked help from Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
(1832-1910), the older writer advised him to think of a career as an
actor. In 1878 Hamsun moved to Christiania (now Oslo), where he lived
in poverty. For some time he supported himself as a highway
construction worker. Between 1882 and 1884 he wandered in the United
States. Returning to Oslo, Hamsun continued his literary career without
much success. From 1886 to 1888 he again traveled in the United States,
where he worked as a streetcar attendant in Chicago and a farmhand in
North Dakota. In Minneapolis he gave lectures. Hamsun was considered
eccentric by Norwegian immigrants, but the Unitarian minister and
writer Kristofer Janson allowed Hamsun to use his large library. This
sojourn produced <em>Fra det&nbsp;moderne&nbsp;Amerikas&nbsp;aandsliv</em>
(1889), a satirical description of America and its spiritual life. </p>
      <p>Hamsun made his breakthrough in 1890 with <i>The Hunger</i>,
a story about a young writer on his own, unable to find work, starving
and homeless in Christiania. Although his clothing, prospects, and
health fail, he guards his dignity (often comically) and pencil stubs.
The narrator, Pontus, wanders through the streets of the city &#8211; "that strange
city no one escapes from until it has left its mark on him..."
Eventually his high-minded articles &#8211; now and then purchased by
newspapers &#8211; become incomprehensible even to his own fevered thoughts.
There is nothing sentimental in his fasting &#8211; it is his own more or
less nihilistic choice. He sells articles to the local paper, and meets
a young woman, who is frightened of his impetuosity. '"Well, I never!"
I blurted out. "Just you wait and see!" And I flung my arms lustily
around her shoulders. Was the girl out of her mind? Did she take me for
a complete greenhorn? Haw-haw, wouldn't I, though, by the living...
None should say about me that I was backward on that score. What a
little devil! If it was juts a matter of pushing on, then..." Losing
his hair in clumps and unable to keep down his hard-won meals, the
narrator finally gets a job as a deckhand on a Russian ship bound for
England. "He fasts. But not in the way a Christian would fast," wrote
Paul Auster in his introduction to <i>Hunger</i>. "He is not denying
earthly life in anticipation of heavenly life; he is simply refusing to
live the life he has been given." <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>The Hunger</i> expressed similar
modernist tendencies as Edvard Munch's famous painting <i>The Cry</i>
(1893), which did not derive from nature but from introspection,
rejecting the notion of objective reality. <i>The Hunger </i>has been
called the first modern road novel. As a type the young writer, who
bears some resemblance to <a href="fdosto">Dostoevsky'</a>s
Underground Man, can be seen a predecessor to Charles Chaplin's famous
screen character, the invincible vagabond, or Henry Miller's narrator
in <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> and <i>Tropic of Capricorn</i>.
Henning Carlsen's film adaptation from 1966 mostly shows Pontus's
doings outside, but there are much point-of-view shots. The
cinematographer Henning Kristiansen also used the overexposed effect
introduced into the movies by <span style="font-style: italic;">Last Year in Marienbad</span> (1961). <br>
  </p>

      <p>The novel became an immediate sensation, and established
Hamsun as a writer of note. Encouraged by this, he criticized in his
lectures such idols as <a href="../../../ibsen.htm">Henrik Ibsen</a>
and
      <a href="../../../ltolstoi.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>. <em>Mysterier </em>(1892)
allowed Hamsun present his contempt for democracy and his admiration of
the Nietzschean superman. The mysterious protagonist has several
identities, he has no fixed personality. He comes from nowhere and then
disappears, commits suicide. <em>Pan</em> (1894), written in the form
of a hunter's diary, was a pantheistic story about escape from urban
civilization. Lieutenant Thomas Glahn, the hunter, falls in love with a
woman who rejects his advances. Hamsun wrote the book during the years
which he spent in Paris (1893-1895). </p>
      <p><em>Victoria</em> (1898) is Hamsun's only full-heartedly
romantic book, a love story. It was written at the beginning of his
marriage with Bergljot Gopfertin, a 25-year old woman, who had
separated from her Austrian husband. Hamsun named his daughter
Victoria, born in 1902, after the novel. The social gulf between the
two young protagonists, Johannes, the miller's son, and Victoria, the
daughter of the lord of the manor, appears uncrossable but they don't
stop loving each other. At the end Victoria writes a letter to Johannes
from her death bed. Bo Widerberg's film adaptation of the novel, which
was shown in Cannes in 1979, was a failure mostly because of poor
dubbing. </p>
      <p>During 1900 Hamsun lived in Finland, writing a long play. He
associated with such Finnish cultural figures as Albert Edelfelt, <a href="gallen.htm">Akseli Gallén-Kallela</a>, Juhani Aho, Alexander
Slotte, Jean Sibelius, and Robert Kajanus. Hamsun's active social life
and heavy drinking with Finnish artists annoyed his wife. From Finland
Hamsun continued his travels to Russia, and the Near East, and settled
then in Copenhagen. During this journey, Hamsun developed a great
respect for the Islamic work, which he expressed in the play <em>Drottning
Tamara</em>&nbsp;(1903). Its basic message is that Christians and
Muslims can live in harmony and learn from each other. </p>
      <p>After divorce in 1906, Hamsun started to work with his first
vagabond book, <em>Under høstræjrnen</em> (1907). In 1909 Hamsun
married an actress, Marie Andersen; they had two daughters and two
sons. Marie Hamsun, who was twenty-three years younger than her
husband, depicted her stormy marriage in her books <i>Regnbuen </i>(1953)
and <i>Under gullregnen</i> (1959). According to Marie, their two
double beds were not "real double beds" set side by side &#8211; Hamsun
wanted a room of his own and needed privacy, not only to write but to
read or smoke a pipe. However, Marie never slept alone, because she had
the company of her children when they were young. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Solen daler st</b></font><b><font size="2">ærkt og det blir en solnedgang så v</font><font size="2">ældig,

Så at om de d</font><font size="2">øde nu så blev det kanske savn efter dem i måseverdenen!"</font></b><font size="2"> </font><font size="2">(in <i>Segelfoss by</i>, 1915) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1911 Hamsun left urban literary circles and moved to a farm
in Nordland. After the publication of <em>Markens g
røde</em> (The Growth of the Soil) in 1917, he purchased an estate,
Nørholm, in southern Norway. He lived there until his death, dividing
his time between writing and farming. Like the American port <a href="rfrost.htm">Robert Frost</a>, Hamsun saw himself both as a
farmer and a writer, an artist-hero. The old-fashioned agrarian toil
became for him an act of individualism. </p>
      <p><i>The Growth of the Soil </i>&#8211; "sounds like a piece of Nazi
propaganda," as Paul Auster said of the book &#8211; earned Hamsun the Nobel
Prize. The protagonist is Isak, Hamsun's ideal hero, who lives close to
the elements. In Hamsun's idyll the human world and nature are united
in a strong, mystical bond.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"The
wilderness was inhabited and unrecognizable, a blessing had come upon
it, life had arisen there from a long dream, human creatures lived
there, children played about the houses. And the forest stretched away,
big and kindly, right up to the blue heights."<b> </b>Although
Hamsun's feeling for the nature was not merely a Norwegian version of
the Teutonic Blut und Boden (blood-and-soil) mystic, his sentiments
were broadly shared in Germany, where his novels had a wide readership.
      </p>
      <p>Between the wars Hamsun became a virtual recluse. He took a
stand against socialism, democracy, feminism, and urban life. After a
mental breakdown, followed by psychoanalytic treatment, he wrote <em>Landstrykare
      </em>(1930), <em>August </em>(1930), and <em>Men&nbsp;livet
lever</em> (1933), which form his Vagabond trilogy. Individualism and
antipathy to modern Western culture led Hamsun to
support the Germans during their occupation of Norway in World War II.
"We are all Germans," the author told his countrymen. Hamsun did not
develop this attitude overnight &#8211; he had sympathized with the German
cause in the First World War when public opinion in Norway
overwhelmingly favored Britain and France. Also Nietzschean tradition
in
fascism fascinated him.</p>
      <p>Hamsun never joined the Norwegian Nazi party, but he wrote a
series of pro-Fascists articles. Marie, his wife, was more close to
Vidkun Quisling, the puppet head of Norway's occupation government.
When Hamsun met in 1943 Adolf Hitler and Josef Goebbels, he gave
Goebbels his Nobel Prize medal as a token of his esteem. These meetings
have inspired stories, in which Hamsun is credited with saving Jews
from the Nazis. However, the journalist and writer Arne Tumyr has
claimed in his biography of the author, that these stories are not
true, and that Hamsun only succeeded in infuriating Hitler with his
complaints about the conduct of German troops in his home country. </p>
      <p>After the war Hamsun was held in custody for some time &#8211; his
wife was imprisoned and sentenced to three years hard labor &#8211; and
transferred in 1945 to a psychiatric clinic in Oslo. From there he was
moved to an old-age home in Landvik. Marie was interrogated and when
she revealed intimate details about their marriage and sexual life,
Hamsun refused to see her for four years. In 1947 Hamsun was tried and
fined for his opinions. Ignoring the advice of counsel, he refused to
pretend that he was senile and showed little remorse. Upon hearing of
Hitler's death, when the war was over, Hamsun wrote: "He was a warrior,
a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all
nations." It was no wonder that during these years Hamsun's books
sold poorly.</p>
      <p>According to Harald S. Naess, editor of Hamsun's published
letters, the author planned to divorce his wife. Hamsun's explanation
of his views and account of his experiences during his trial, <em>På
gjengrodde stier</em> (On Overgrown Paths), appeared in 1949, when he
was ninety years old. It sold out instantly, and showed that his mental
resources were intact. Hamsun died in Nørholm, on February 19, 1952.
Since then his reputation has been largely rehabilitated and there is
renewed interest in his oeuvre. Hamsun also wrote travel books, essays,
and short stories. His
dramas were not very successful when they were staged, but Stanislawski
is said to have admired Hamsun's work.</p>
