<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm&nbsp;&#8211; famous for their classical collections of folk songs and folktales, especially
for <span class="st"><em>Kinder- und Hausmärchen</em> </span>(Children's and Household Tales); 
generally known as <i>Grimm's Fairy Tales. </i>Stories
such as 'Snow White' and 'Sleeping Beauty' have been retold countless
times, but they were first written down by the Brothers Grimm. In their
collaboration Wilhelm,
who was the more imaginative and literary of the two, selected and
arranged the stories, while Jacob was responsible for the
scholarly work. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'Silly goose,' said the old woman. 'The
door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!' and she crept up
and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that
drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt.
Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the
godless witch was miserably burnt to death."</b> </font><font size="2"><font size="2">(from 'Hansel and Gretel') </font></font></blockquote>

<p>Wilhelm Grimm was born in Hanau. His father, who was educated in law
and served as a town clerk, died when Wilhelm was young. His mother
Dorothea struggled to pay the education of the children. With financial
help of Dorothea's sister, Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to Kasel to
attend the Lyzeum. Wilhelm always suffered from poor health, which made
regular work difficult. He was was nonetheless more animated, jovial,
and sociable than Jacob. After studying law at Marburg, he worked as a
secretary at Kassel, where Jacob served as librarian. In 1812, the year
their fairy tales were first published, the Grimms were surviving on a
single meal a day. Between 1821 and 1822 the brothers raised extra
money by collecting three volumes of folktales. With these publications
they wanted to show, that Germans shared a similar culture and advocate
the unification process of the small independent kingdoms and
principalities. </p>
<p>Altogether some 40 persons delivered tales to the Grimms. Probably
the German writer Clemens Bretano first awoke their interest in folk
literature. Their first tales date from 1807. The first volume, which
contained 86 items, was published by Georg Andreas Reimer at Berlin.
The most important informants included Dorothea Viehmann, the daughter
of an innkeeper, Johann Friedrich Krause, an old dragoon, and Marie
Hassenpflug, a 20-year-old friend of their sister, Charlotte, from a
well-bred, French-speaking family. Marie's stories blended motifs from
the oral tradition and Perrault's <i>Tales of My Mother Goose</i> (1697). From Dorothea Viehmann the brothers got the story about 'Cinderella'.</p>
<p>In 1829 the brothers moved to Göttingen, Wilhelm becoming assistant
librarian and Jacob librarian. In 1835 Wilhelm was appointed professor,
but they were dismissed two
years later for protesting against the abrogation of the Hannover
constitution by King Ernest Augustus. In 1840 the brothers accepted an
invitation from the king of Prussia, Frederick William IV, to go to
Berlin. There, as members of the Royal Academy of Sciences, they
lectured at the university. In 1841 they became professors at the
University of Berlin, and worked with their most ambitious enterprise,
the&nbsp; <em>Deutsches Wörterbuch,</em> a large German dictionary. 
Its first volume&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in the 1850s. The work, 32 volumes, was finished 
in the 1960s.</p>

<p>The Grimms made major contributions in many fields, notably in
the studies of heroic myth and the ancient religion and law. They
worked very close, even after Wilhelm married in 1825 his childhood
friend Dortchen Wild, who was a prominent source of fairy tales for
their collection. Jacob remained unmarried. Wilhelm died of infection
in Berlin on December 16, 1859, and Jacob four years later on September
20, 1863. </p>
 

<p>The Grimms came over a century after Madame d'Aulnoy and Charles Perrault, who between them first created 
and popularized the literary fairy tale. Grimms were more intent on capturing the genuine oral tradition &#8211; 
earlier Ludwig Tieck and Johann-Karl Musaeus relied more on the gothic tradition than folklore. 
In English Grimms' <i>Tales</i> are often referred as "fairytales", but only a few of them involve 
mythical creatures. The first English translation appeared anonymously in 1823, but it was the work of 
the London solicitor Edgar Taylor and his collaborator David Jardine. Noteworthy, this edition was
illustrated by George Cruikshank; Jacob and Wilhelm themselves followed the example and encouraged their 
younger brother Ludwig Emil to illustrate the <em>Kleine Ausgabe </em>(1825). After its 
appearance, the <i>Tales</i> became to be regarded as a children's book. 

</p>
<p><i>Kinder- und Hausmärchen</i> was originally published in two volumes
(1812-1815). The final edition&nbsp; &#8211; the last to appear during their life time &#8211; 
was published in 1857 and contained 211 tales; 
a further 28 had been dropped from earlier editions, making 239 in total. 
The Grimms wrote down most of the tales from oral narrations,
collecting the material mainly from peasants in Hesse. The first edition 
included stories in 10 dialects as well as High German. Among the 
best-known stories are '<i></i>Hansel and Gretel,' 'Cinderella,' 
'Rumpelstiltskin,' 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' and 'The Golden Goose<i></i>.' 
The stories include magic, communication between animals and men, and 
moral values, teachings of social right and wrong. The term 'Hausmärchen' in the 
title refers to 'Hausmärlein,' a term created by Georg Rollenhagen in 1595; 'household 
tales' were meant to serve as a guide for Christian upbringing. </p>

<p>The brothers are generally treated as a team, though Jacob 
concentrated on linguistic studies and Wilhelm was primarily a literary 
scholar. Jacob wrote down most of the tales published in the first volume. 
From 1819 onward, Wilhelm supervised all subsequent editions on his own, because Jacob was 
repeatedly away on diplomatic missions. During the editing phase they 
 constantly consulted each other. </p>

<p>The Grimms' were affected by the ideas of Enlightenment and the German Romanticism and its 
interest in mythology, folklore and dreams. In his masterly guide <i>The March of the Literature</i>
(1938) the English writer Ford Madox Ford sees that their work was more
than a mere reflection of German romanticism: "But the real apotheosis
of this side of the Teutonic cosmos came into its own through the
labors of the brothers Ludwig Karl, and Wilhelm Karl Grimm for whom the
measure of our administration may well be marked by the fact that there
is nothing in the world left to say about their collection of fairy
tales. It is, on the whole, wrong to concede the brothers Grimm to the
romantics. They belonged to the earth movement and are known wherever
the sky covers the land. That is the real German Empire." <b></b>Jacob
and Wilhelm Grimm argued that folktales should be collected from oral
sources, which aimed at genuine reproduction of the original story.
Their method became model for other scholars. However, in practice the
tales were modified. </p><p>In
later editions of the fairytales Wilhelm's editing and literary
aspiration were more prominent. He continued to reshape the tales up to
the final edition of 1857 &#8211; he also removed any hint of sexual
activity, such as the premarital couplings of Rapunzel and the prince
who climbed into her tower. In 'The Frog Prince, or Iron-Henry' a
beautiful princess loses her ball into a well. A frog promises to bring
the ball back to her, if she loves the frog, lets it be her companion
and play-fellow, and sleep in her bed. Actually the frog is a prince,
bewitched by a wicked witch. In spite some changes, the cores of the
stories were left untouched. The Grimm's tales are in fact much closer
to genuine folk origins than <a href="hcanders.htm">Hans Christian Andersen</a>'s 
tales &#8211; he is considered the best-known tellers of fairy tales. </p>

<p>While collaborating with Jacob was Wilhelm's contribution to science
is his collection <em>Die deutsche Heldensage</em> (The German Heroic Tale). 
In 1840 the Brothers Grimm began the 
<i>Deutsches Wörterbuch</i>, intended as a guide for the user of the
written and spoken word as well as a scholarly reference work.
Wilhelm's work proceeded to the letter D, Jacob lived to see the work
proceed to the letter F.</p>
<p>Both brothers argued that folktales should be recorded and presented
in print in a form as close as possible to the original mode. It also
meant that some of the stories contained unpleasant details. Doves peck
out the eyes of Cinderella's stepsisters, and in 'The Juniper Tree' a
woman decapitates her stepson. A witch kills her own daughter in
'Darling Roland.' "These stories are suffused with the same purity that
makes children so marvelous and blessed," wrote Wilhelm Grimm in the
preface to the <i>Nursery and Household Tales. </i>In practice 
the brothers modified folktales in varying ways, sometimes even intensifying violent episodes. Especially references 
to sexuality embarrassed the Grimms'. </p><p>In
'The Snow White' the violence was toned down by later editions: at the
end of the story the wicked Queen is forced to put on red-hot iron
slippers and dance till she dies. The witch ends up&nbsp;in the oven
and is baked alive In 'Hansel and Gretel.'"Oh, 
you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to 
you."  <font size="2"><font size="2">(from 'Hansel and Gretel') </font></font>Little
red Riding Hood was turned In Nazi Germany into a symbol of the German
people, saved from the evil Jewish wolf. In the 1970s the tales were
scorned for promoting a sexists, authority-ridden world view. The tales
were largely banned from the German nursery. However,&nbsp;the Grimm's
world has been utilized by many modern fantasists and filmmakers,
including Tanith Lee, Robin McKinley, Patricia Wrede, and the director
Terry Gillam. The 200th anniversary of the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Die Kinder und Hausmärchen</span> in Kassel in 2012 launched the 2013 celebrations of the brothers.&nbsp;
