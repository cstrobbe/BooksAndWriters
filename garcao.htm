      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Portuguese Neoclassical
poet,&nbsp; a member of <em>Arcádia Lusitana, </em>an influential
literary society formed in 1756. Garção&nbsp;sought inspiration from
the poetry of ancient Rome,&nbsp;from its conscientious and polished
expression. His&nbsp;<em>Cantata de Dido</em>, inspired by Vergil's
Book IV of <em>The Aeneid</em><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;is considered
among the best poems of the era. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Já no roxo oriente branqueando,</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">As prenhes velas da troiana frota</font><br>
        <font size="2">Entre as vagas azuis do mar dourado</font><br>

(from 'Cantata de Dido')</font></blockquote>
      <p>Pedro Antonio Correia Garção was born in Lisbon into a
well-to-do family. His father, Philippe Corrêa da Serra, had a post at
the foreign office. Garção's mother was of French origin. At home
Garção learned English. French and Italian. After attending a Jesuit
school in Lisbon, Garção studied law at Coimbra.&nbsp;In 1750 he
&nbsp;was was created a knight of the Order of Christ. Garção's
marriage with D. Maria Salema in 1751&nbsp;brought him a&nbsp;rich
dowry. In addition, he earned substantial income from his
administrative post&nbsp;at the India House&nbsp;(Casa da India), where
ships loaded and unloaded their cargoes and where Custom duties were
collected. </p>
      <p>Garção became in 1756 a member of <i>Arcádia Lusitana </i>(or
Arcádia Ulissiponense), which had as its motto "cut out everything that
is useless"&nbsp; (inutilia truncat).&nbsp;The unofficial literary
society was supported by government and opposed old forms and ideals in
poetry. Its members favored blank verse and brought to its meetings
literary works to be read and criticized. They also had pseudonyms &#8211;
Garção was "Córidon Erimanteu." The literary Academy was founded in 1756, four
months after the earthquake of Lisbon in 1755, by three just graduated
law students, António da Cruz e Silva (see below), Teotónio Gomes de
Carvalho, and Manuel Nicolau Esteves Negrão. The devastating earthquake
partly inspired <a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a>'s satire <i>Candide
      </i>(1759).
Until 1760, the society was very active, but following the the policy
of terror, that characterized the years of 1759-1760,
its activitiesgradually ceased. It also had a successor,  <i>Nova Arcádia</i>.
In the name of the "Lusitanian Literary Academy", Garção wrote a
discourse, in which he congratulated government's&nbsp;
economic policies, stating that the merchant class "is the most useful
and distinguished sector of the Portuguese people." After the
earthquake, the name of square where the royal palace had stood, was
changed from "Palace Place" to "Commerce Square". </p>
      <p>From 1760 to 1762 Garção edited the <i>Gazeta de Lisbon</i>.
His verse play <em>Teatro Novo </em>(1766) attacked foreign
influences in the theatre, but he admired English and French
literature.&nbsp;In tune with the changes taking place&nbsp;in society,
he&nbsp;
wished to reform the Portuguese drama on classic principles, with a due
regard to modern times. Garção's satirical attitude towards the social
life of Lisbon, especially ostentatious boasting, is seen in his
one-act comedy <em>Assembléia ou Partida</em> (The Assembly or the
Party).&nbsp;Garção ridiculed people who invite a distinguished company
into their home, where everything&nbsp; from spoons and teacups to
furniture and rugs is borrowed for the occasion. The play was written
under the influence of French theatre without imitation, but it also
showed traces of the emerging Italian opera. Garção introduced into the
piece sonnets and a cantata, which is performed by one of the
characters. They have a debate concerning the introduction of the
French literary salon in Portugal. Interest in foreign literature was
shared by many other writers, too, who adopted ideas of Enlightenment
in Portugal.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Among Garção's best-known works is <em>Cantata de Dido</em>
(The Cantata of Dido), combined in accordance with the 4th book of <a href="virgil.htm">Aenid</a> and in the spirit of classical art with
perfection of form. It is one of the most celebrated 18th-century
Portuguese poems. Garção himself was called "the second Portuguese
Horace"; "the first" was Antonio Ferreira (1528-1569), although
Garção's satires and epistles have more of Horatian lightness than
Ferreira had.&nbsp;An&nbsp;English&nbsp;translation of&nbsp;<em>The
Cantata of Dido</em>&nbsp;appeared in 1832 in <em>The Foreign
Quarterly Review</em>, Vol. X: "Already in the ruddy east shone white <span class="st"><span class="ft">/ The pregnant sails that speed the Trojan
fleet, /&nbsp;Now wafted on the pinions of the wind&nbsp;/ They vanish
midst the golden sea's blue waves. /&nbsp;The miserable
Dido&nbsp;/&nbsp;Wanders loud shrieking through her regal
halls&nbsp;/&nbsp;With dim and turbid eyes seeking in vain / The
fugitive Æneas</span></span>." A new&nbsp;version was published in 1895
in the <em>Academy</em> (January 19th).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Garção
was a well known figure among the English residents in
the city and there were rumors about the nature of his relationship
with a married English lady. Following a law-suit,
&nbsp;Garção lost his property in his later years, and he fell out of
favor with the highly influential politician, the Marquis of Pombal
(1699-1782), who started among others to reform schools in his country,
but also enforced censorship and enlarged other mechanisms of political
control.
In April 1771&nbsp;Garção imprisoned for unclear reasons. <br>
</p>
      <p>Garção died in Lisbon on November 10, 1772, in prison. On same day
Pombal had undersigned an order to release him. <i>Arcádia</i> society
became unpopular and finished its activities in 1775, but its impact on
poetry was profound. Pombal's death also stopped further cultural
reforms. Garção's collected works were published in 1778. </p>
