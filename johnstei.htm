<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American novelist, story writer, playwright,
and essayist. John Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1962. He is best remembered for <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Grapes of Wrath </span>(1939), a novel widely considered to be a
20th-century classic. The impact of the book has been compared to that
of <a href="hbstowe.htm">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i>. Steinbeck's epic about the migration of the Joad family,
driven from its bit of land in Oklahoma to California, provoked a wide
debate about the hard lot of migrant laborers, and helped to put an
agricultural reform into effect. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Man, unlike any other thing
organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up
in the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments</b></font><b><font size="2">."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><font size="2"><i>The Grapes of Wrath</i></font><b><font size="2">) </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>John Steinbeck was born in Salinas, California. His native
region of Monterey Bay was later the setting for most of his fiction.
"We were poor people with a hell of a lot of land which made us think
we were rich people," the author once recalled. Steinbeck's father was
a county treasurer. From his mother, a teacher, Steinbeck learned to
love books. Among his early favorites were Dostoevsky's <i>Crime and
Punishment</i>, Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and <i>Le Morte
d'Arthur</i>. </p>
      <p>Steinbeck attended the local high school and worked on farms
and ranches during his vacations. To finance his education, he held
many jobs and sometimes dropped out of college for whole quarters. In
1923 he took a general zoology course at the Hopkins Marine station,
Pacific Grove, but did not continue his studies further <font face="Symbol">-</font> he always planned to be a writer. His early
poems and short stories appeared in diverse magazines. After spending a
short time as a laborer on the construction of Madison Square Garden in
New York City and reporter for the <i>American</i>, Steinbeck returned
to California. While writing, Steinbeck took odd jobs. He was
apprenticehood-carrier, apprentice painter, caretaker of an estate,
surveyor, and fruit-picker. During a period, when he was as a watchman
of a house in the High Sierra, Steinbeck wrote his first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cup of Gold </span>(1929). It failed to
earn back the $250 the publisher had given him in an advance. </p>
      <p>In Pacific Grove in the early 1930s, Steinbeck met Edward
Ricketts. He was a marine biologist, whose views on the interdependence
of all life deeply influenced Steinbeck's thinking. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sea of Cortez</span> (1941) resulted from
an expedition in the Gulf of California he made with Ricketts. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Pastures of Heaven</span>
(1932) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Long Valley</span>
(1938) were short story collections, in which the Salinas valley played
similar mythical role as the imaginary Yoknapatawpha County in <a href="faulkner.htm">Faulkner</a>'s works, based largely on his
hometown of Oxford, in Lafayette County, Mississippi. In the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">To a God Unknown </span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
(1933) Steinbeck mingled Ricketts' ideas with <a href="cjung.htm">Jungian
      </a>concepts and themes, which had been made familiar by the
mythologist <a href="campb.htm">Joseph Campbell</a>. The novel depicts
a farmer, Joseph Wayne, who receives a blessing from his pioneer
father, John Wayne, and goes to build himself a new farm in a distant
valley. Joseph develops his own beliefs of death and life, and to bring
an end to a drought, he sacrifices himself on a stone, becoming "earth
and rain". Steinbeck did not want to explain his story too much and he
knew beforehand that the book would not find readers. </p>
      <p>Steinbeck's first three novels went unnoticed, but his
humorous tale of pleasure-loving Mexican-Americans, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tortilla Flat</span> (1935), brought him
wider recognition. The theme of the book<font face="Symbol">-</font>the
story of King Arthur and the forming of the Round Table<font face="Symbol">-</font> emained well hidden from the readers and
critics as well. However, Steinbeck's financial situation improved
significantly<font face="Symbol">-</font>he had earned $35 a week for a
long time, but now he was paid thousands of dollars for the film rights
to <i>Tortilla Flat</i>. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">In Dubious Battle</span>
(1936) was a strike novel set in the California apple country. The
strike of nine hundred migratory workers is led by Jim Nolan, devoted
to his cause. Before his death Jim confesses: "I never had time to look
at things, Mac, never. I never looked how leaves come out. I never
looked at the way things happen." One of the characters, Doc Burton, a
detached observer, Steinbeck partly derived from his friend Ed
Ricketts. Later Steinbeck developed his observer's personality with
changes in such works as <span style="font-style: italic;">Cannery Row</span>
(1945), which returned to the world of <i>Tortilla Flat</i>. The novel
was an account of the adventures and misadventures of workers in a
California cannery and their friends. Its sequel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sweet Thurday</span> came out in 1954. </p>
      <p>The events of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Red Pony</span>
(1937) take place on the Tiflin ranch in the Salinas Valley,
California. The first two sections of the story sequence, "The Gift"
and "The Great Mountains", were published in the <i>North American
Review</i> in 1933, and the third section, "The Promise," did not
appear in <i>Harpers</i> until 1937. With "The Leader of the People,"
the four sections are connected by common characters, settings, and
themes. Through each story, the reader follows Jody's initiation into
adult life, in which the pony of the title functions as a symbol of his
innocence and maturation. A movie version, for which Steinbeck wrote
the screenplay, was made in 1949. Steinbeck's other script assignments
include <i>The Pearl</i>, the prose treatment for Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Lifeboat</i>
(1944), and the script for Elia Kazan's <i>Viva Zapata!</i> (1952),
starring Marlon Brando. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Of Mice and Men</span>
(1937), a story of shattered dreams, became Steinbeck's first big
success. Steinbeck adapted it also into a three-act play, which was
produced in 1937. George Milton and Lennia Small, two itinerant
ranchhands, dream of one day owning a small farm. George acts as a
father figure to Lennie, who is large and simpleminded. Lennie loves
all that is soft, but his immense physical strength is a source of
troubles and George is needed to calm him. The two friends find work
from a farm and start saving money for their future. Annoyed by the
bullying foreman of the ranch, Lenny breaks the foreman's arm, but also
wakes the interest of the ranch owner's flirtatious daughter-in-law.
Lenny accidentally kills her and escapes into the hiding place, that he
and George have agreed to use, if they get into difficulties. George
hurries after Lenny and shoots him before he is captured by a vengeful
mob but at the same time he loses his own hopes and dreams of better
future. Before he dies, Lennie says: "Let's do it now. Le's get that
place now." </p>
      <p>For <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i><font face="Symbol">-</font> the title originated from Julia Ward Howe's <i>The
Battle Hymn of the Republic</i> (1861)<font face="Symbol">-</font>Steinbeck
traveled around California migrant camps in 1936. When the book
appeared, it was attacked by US Congressman Lyle Boren, who
characterized it as "a lie, a black, infernal creation of twisted,
distorted mind". Later, when Steinbeck received his Nobel Prize, the
Swedish Academy called it simply "an epic chronicle." The Exodus story
of Okies on their way to an uncertain future in California, ends with a
scene in which Rose of Sharon, who has just delivered a stillborn
child, suckles a starving man with her breast. "Rose of Sharon loosened
one side of the blanket and bared her breast. 'You got to,' she said.
She squirmed closer and pulled his head close. 'There!' she said.
'There.' Her hand moved behind his head and supported it. Her fingers
moved gently in his hair. She looked up and across the barn, and her
lips came together and smiled mysteriously." </p>
      <p>John Ford's film version from 1940, produced by Darryl F.
Zanuck, dismissed this ending<font face="Symbol">-</font>the final
images optimistically celebrate President Roosevelt's New Deal. "We're
the people that live. They can't wipe us out. They can't lick us. We'll
go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people," says Ma Joad. Steinbeck
himself was skeptical of Hollywood's faithfulness to his material.
However, after seeing the film he said: "Zanuck has more than kept his
word. He has a hard, straight picture in which the actors are submerged
so completely that it looks and feels like a documentary film and
certainly has a hard, truthful ring." Orson Welles did not like Ford's
interpretation because he "made that into a story about mother love." </p>
      <p>Fleeing publicity followed by the success of <i>The Grapes of
Wrath</i>, Steinbeck went to Mexico in 1940 to film the documentary <i>Forgotten
Village</i>. During WW II, Steinbeck served as a war correspondent for
the New York <i>Herald Tribune</i> in Great Britain and the
Mediterranean area. He wrote such government propaganda as the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Moon Is Down </span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
(1942), about resistance movement in a small town, presumaly in Norway, occupied by the
Nazis. Its film version, starring Henry Travers, Cedric Hardwicke, and
Lee J. Cobb, was shot on the set of <i>How Green Was My Valley</i>
(1941), which depicted a Welsh mining village. "Free men cannot start a
war," Steinbeck wrote, "but once it is started, they can fight on in
defeat. Herd men, followers of a leader, cannot do that, and so it is
always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars."
Steinbeck had visited Europe in 1937 after gaining success with <i>Of
Mice and Men</i>, and met on a Swedish ship two Norwegians, with whom
he had celebrated Norway's independence day. In 1943 Steinbeck moved to
New York City, his home for the rest of his life. His summers the
author spent at Sag Harbor. He also travelled much in Europe. </p>
      <p>Steinbeck's twelve-year marriage to Carol Henning had ended in
1942. Next year he married the singer Gwyndolyn Conger; they had two
sons, Thom and John. However, the marriage was unhappy and they were
divorced in 1949. Steinbeck's postwar works include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Pearl</span> (1947), a
symbolic tale of a Mexican Indian pearl diver Kino. He finds a valuable
pearl which changes his life, but not in the way he did expect. Kino
sees the pearl as his opportunity to better life. When the townsfolk of
La Paz learn of Kino's treasury, he is soon surrounded by a greedy
priest, doctor, and businessmen. Kino's family suffers series of
disasters and finally he throws the pearl back into ocean. Thereafter
his tragedy is legendary in the town. Thematically <a href="hemingwa.htm">Hemingway</a>'s novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>
from 1952 has much similarities with this work. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">A Russian Journal</span>
(1948) was an account of the author's journey to the Soviet Union with
the photographer Robert Capa. Steinbeck's idea was to describe the
country without prejudices, but he could not move freely, he could not
speak Russian, and the Soviet hosts, perhaps by the order of Stalin
himself, took care that there were more than enough vodka, champagne,
caviar, chickens, honey, tomatoes, kebabs, and watermelons on their
guest's table. Steinbeck was appalled by the devastation he saw in
Leningrad, Stalingrad, and&nbsp; Kiev. The journey continued to
Georgia, "the paradise Russians like to think they will go to when they
die," as Steinbeck wrote. <br>
 </p>
      <p>The director Elia Kazan met Steinbeck when the author had
separated from Gwyn and was drinking heavily. "I don't think John
Steinbeck should have been living in New York, I don't think he should
have been writing plays," Kazan wrote in his autobiography <i>A Life </i>(1988).
"He was a prose writer, at home in the west, with land, with horses, or
on a boat; in this big city, he was a dupe." Their most famous film
project, <i>East of Eden</i>, covered the last part of the book. James
Dean made his debut in the film. Kazan originally wanted Marlon Brando
to play the role of Cal. He sent Dean to see Steinbeck, who considered
him a snotty kid, but said he was Cal "sure as hell". Dean received an
Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, but Lee Rogow in the <i>Saturday
Review</i> was not satisfied (March 19, 1955); "Kazan has apparently
attempted to graft a Brando-type personality and set of mannerisms upon
Dean, and the result is less than successful... this artful
construction of a performance is not, to get Stanislavskian about it,
building a character." </p>
      <p>In 1950 Steinbeck married Elaine (Anderson) Scott, the
independent daughter of Texas oilman and
the ex-wife Zachery Scott, an actor. They purchased a house in New
York, where he settled down to write <span style="font-style: italic;">East
of Eden </span>(1952). Elaine took care of the house and his sons when
they visited. </p>
      <p><i>East of Eden</i>, the title referring to the fallen world,
is long family novel, is set in rural California in the years around
the turn of the century. In the center of the saga, based partly on the
story of Cain and Abel, is two families of settlers, the Trasks and the
Hamiltons, whose history reflect the formation of the United States,
when "the Church and the whorehouse arrived in the Far West
simultaneously..."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>The second half of the
story focus on the lives of the twins, Aron and Caleb, and their
conflict. Between them is Cathy, tiny, pretty, but an adulteress and
murderess. "It doesn't matter that Cathy was what I have called a
monster. Perhaps we can't understand Cathy, but on the other hand we
are capable of many things in all directions, of great virtues and
great sins. And who in his mind has not probed the black water?" </p>
      <p>Steinbeck wrote thousands of letters, sometimes several a day.
To Pascal Covici, his friend, he confessed that he wanted to write the
work to his sons, the story of good and evil, love and hate, to
demonstrate to them how they are inseparable. His writing process
Steinbeck recorded minutely in <span style="font-style: italic;">Journal
of a Novel</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> (1969). "But
tell me," he wrote to Covici, "have you ever been this closely
associated with a book before? While it was being written." </p>
      <p>In 1959 Steinbeck spent nearly a year at Discove Cottage in
England, working with <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, the first book he had
read as a child. After returning to the United States, he travelled
around his country with his poodle, Charley, and published in 1962 <span style="font-style: italic;">Travels with Charley in Search of America</span>.
His son John wrote in his memoir that Steinbeck was too shy to talk to
any of the people in the book. "He couldn't handle that amount of
interaction. So, the book is actually a great novel." </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Winter of Our Discontent</span>
(1961), set in contemporary America, was Steinbeck's last major novel.
The book was not well received, and critics considered him an
exhausted. Not even the Nobel Prize changed opinions. The short list
for the 1962 prize consisted of Steinbeck, Robert Graves, Lawrence
Durrell, Jean Anouilh and Karen Blixen; Steinbeck was a compromise
choice. <i>The New York
Times</i> asked in an editorial, whether the prize committee might not
have made a better choice. Steinbeck took this public humiliation hard.
In later years he did much special reporting abroad, dividing his time
between New York and California. </p>
      <p>When Steinbeck toured the USSR again in 1963 with his wife, he was greeted as a "progressive" American writer. However, his <span style="font-style: italic;">Russian Journal </span>from
1948 was not published in Russia until 42 years after it had appeared
in America. For the disappointment of Soviet authorities, Steinbeck did
not condemn the growing American involvement in Vietnam. On his flight
from Yerevan to Moscow, Steinbeck and his American travel companions
were given seats in the only row in the airplane, that did not have
windows. <font size="-1">('A Note on Steinbeck's 1963 Visit the Soviet Union' by Peter Bridges, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Steinbeck Review</span>, Volume 4, Number 1, Spring 2007) </font><br>
</p>
      <p>For a while, Steinbeck served as an advisor to President
Lyndon B. Johnson, whose Vietnam policies he agreed with. At the White
House President asked Steinbeck to report on the war.
Steinbeck wrote for the newspaper Newsday a series of articles, which
divided his readers. The <i>New York Post</i><i> </i>attacked him for
betraying his liberal past. </p>

      <p>John Steinbeck died of heart attack in New York on December
20, 1968. In the posthumously published <span style="font-style: italic;">The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble
Knights</span> (1976), Steinbeck turned his back on contemporary
subjects and brought to life the Arthurian world with its ancient codes
of honour. Steinbeck had started the work with enthusiasm but never
finished it. Steinbeck's son John had problems in later years with
drugs and alcohol; he died in 1991.

- <font size="2">film: The Grapes of Wrath, 1940, dir. by John Ford, written by </font><a href="nunnally.htm"><font size="2">Nunnally Johnson</font></a><font size="2">, starring Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, Charley
Grapewin. "Johnson's script also has some advantages over the novel,
presenting a simpler, leaner narrative line in place of Steinbeck's
often repetitious structure and keeping the biblical simplicity of his
dialogue while jettisoning his preachy rhetorical interludes. And what
Zanuck and Johnson muted in the screenplay, Ford and cinematographer
Gregg Toland compensate for with searingly eloquent imagery." (Joseph
