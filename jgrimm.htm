<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm&nbsp;&#8211;
famous for their classical collections of folk songs and folktales,
especially for<em> </em><span class="st"><em>Kinder- und Hausmärchen</em>
      </span>(Children's and Household Tales); generally known as <i>Grimm's
Fairy Tales</i>, which helped to establish the science of folklore.
Stories such as 'Snow White' and 'Sleeping Beauty' have been retold
countless times, but they were first written down by the Brothers
Grimm. In their collaboration Wilhelm selected and arranged the
stories, while Jacob, who was more interested in language and
philology, was responsible for the scholarly work. The English writer
Ford Madox Ford sees in his masterly guide <i>The March of the
Literature </i>(1938) that their tales were more than a mere
reflection of German romanticism: </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But the real apotheosis of this
side of the Teutonic cosmos came into its own through the labors of the
brothers Ludwig Karl, and Wilhelm Karl Grimm for whom the measure of
our administration may well be marked by the fact that there is nothing
in the world left to say about their collection of fairy tales. It is,
on the whole, wrong to concede the brothers Grimm to the romantics.
They belonged to the earth movement and are known wherever the sky
covers the land. That is the real German Empire." </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Jacob Grimm was born in Hanau. His father, who was educated in
law and served as a town clerk, died when Jacob was young. His mother
Dorothea struggled to pay the education of the children. With financial
help of Dorothea's sister, Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to Kasel to
attend the Lyzeum. Jacob then studied law at Marburg. He worked from
1816 to 1829 as a librarian at Kasel, where his brother served as a
secretary. Between 1821 and 1822 the brothers raised extra money by
collecting three volumes of folktales. With these publications they
wanted to show, that Germans shared a similar culture and advocate the
unification process of the small independent kingdoms and
principalities. </p>
      <p>Altogether some 40 persons delivered tales to the Grimms.
Probably the German writer Clemens Bretano first awoke their interest
in folk literature. Their first tales date from 1807. The the most
important informants included Dorothea Viehmann, the daughter of an
innkeeper, Johann Friedrich Krause, an old dragoon, and Marie
Hassenpflug, a 20-year-old friend of their sister, Charlotte, from a
well-bred, French-speaking family. Marie's stories blended motifs from
the oral tradition and Perrault's <i>Tales of My Mother Goose</i>
(1697). </p>
      <p>The brothers moved in 1830
Göttingen, Wilhelm becoming assistant librarian and Jacob librarian. In
1835 Wilhelm was appointed professor, but they were dismissed two
years later for protesting against the abrogation of the Hannover
constitution by King Ernest Augustus. In 1841 they became professors at
the University of Berlin, and worked with <em>Deutsches Wörterbuch</em>.
Its first volume&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in the 1850s; the work was finished
in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>The Grimms made major contributions in many fields, notably in
the studies of heroic myth and the ancient religion and law. They
worked very close, even after Wilhelm married in 1825. Jacob remained
unmarried. Wilhelm died in Berlin on December 16, 1859 and Jacob four
years later on September 20, 1863. He had just finished writing the
dictionary definition for <i>Frucht</i>. </p>
      <p>The Grimms came over a century after Madame d'Aulnoy and
Charles Perrault, who between them first created and popularized the
literary fairy tale. Grimms were more intent on capturing the genuine
oral tradition &#8211; earlier Ludwig Tieck and Johann-Karl Musaeus relied
more on the gothic tradition than folklore. In English Grimms' <i>Tales</i>
are often referred as "fairytales", but only a few of them involve
mythical creatures. The first English translation appeared anonymously
in 1823, under the title <i>German Popular Stories, translated from
the Kinder und Haus Märchen, collected by M.M. Grimm, from Oral
Tradition</i>. It was the work of the London lawyer Edgar Taylor and
his collaborator David Jardine. Noteworthy, this edition was
illustrated by George Cruikshank; Jacob and Wilhelm themselves followed
the example and encouraged their younger brother Ludwig Emil to
illustrate the <em>Kleine Ausgabe</em> (1825). After its appearance,
the <i>Tales</i> became to be regarded as a children's book. </p>
      <p><i>Kinder- und Hausmärchen</i> was published in two volumes
(1812-1815). In 1810 they had sent to Bretano brief summaries of the
tales, but when his plans to publish an edition of fairy tales never
realized, they turned to Achim von Arnim, who encouraged the brothers
to publish their own collection.
The final edition was appeared in 1857 and contained 211 tales; a
further 28 had been dropped from earlier editions, making 239 in total.
The Grimms wrote down most of the tales from oral narrations,
collecting the material mainly from peasants in Hesse. The first
edition
included stories in 10 dialects as well as High German. Among the
best-known stories are 'Hansel and Gretel,' 'Cinderella,'
'Rumpelstiltskin,' 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' and 'The Golden
Goose.' The stories include magic, communication between animals
and men, and moral values, teachings of social wright and wrong.
Critics complained, that some of the tales were not appropriate for
children, who nevertheless were fascinated by their grim magic: "What a
tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful &#8211; she will be better
to eat than the old woman." (from 'Little Red-Cap') </p>
      <p>The brothers are generally treated as a team, though Jacob
concentrated on linguistic studies and Wilhelm was primarily a literary
scholar. Jacob wrote down most of the tales published in the first
volume. From 1819 onward, Wilhelm supervised all subsequent editions on
his own, because Jacob was repeatedly away on diplomatic missions.
During the editing phase they constantly consulted each other. </p>
      <p>The Grimms' were affected by the ideas of Enlightenment and
the German Romanticism and its interest in mythology, folklore and
dreams. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm argued that folktales should be
collected from oral sources, which aimed at genuine reproduction of the
original story. Their method became also model for other scholars.
However, in practice the tales were modified, and in later editions of
the fairytales Wilhelm's editing and literary aspiration were more
prominent. </p>
      <p>From his first book, <span class="st"><em>Über den
altdeutschen Meistergesang</em> </span>(1811) Jacob Grimm supported
the theory about the unique relationship between the 'original' German
language and the folktales, whose origins were coeval with the origins
of German culture. </p>
      <p>While collaborating with Wilhelm Jakob turned to study of
philology, producing the <span class="st"><span class="ft">Deutsche
Grammatik</span></span>. Jakob's views on grammar influenced deeply the
contemporary study of linguistics, Germanic,
Romance, and Slavic. The work is in use even now. In 1822 Jacob devised
the principle of consonantal shifts in pronunciation known as Grimm's
Law. He illustrated the changes in Germanic by citing contrasting
cognates in Latin, Greek, or Sanskrit. </p>
      <p>In Jacob Grimm's <span class="st"><em>Deutsche mythologie</em>&nbsp;</span>fairy
tales are traced in the pre-Christian era, in ancient faith and
superstitions of the Germanic peoples. The archaic pre-medieval Germany
was seen representing a Golden Age, a period of comparative harmony and
happiness before it was lost. This romantic view of the history owed
much to Bible's tale of Eden or perhaps also Arthurian legends. </p>
      <p>Both brothers argued that folktales should be recorded and
presented in print in a form as close as possible to the original mode.
It also meant that some of the stories contained unpleasant details.
Doves peck out the eyes of Cinderella's stepsisters, and in 'The
Juniper Tree' a woman decapitates her stepson. A witch kills her own
daughter in 'Darling Roland.' "These stories are suffused with the same
purity that makes children so marvelous and blessed," wrote Wilhelm
Grimm in the preface to the <i>Nursery and Household Tales. </i>In
practice the brothers modified folktales in varying ways, sometimes
even intensifying violent episodes. Especially references to sexuality
embarrassed the Grimms'. In 'The Snow White' the violence was toned
down by later editions: at the end of the story the wicked Queen is
forced to put on red-hot iron slippers and dance till she dies.&nbsp;
The witch ends up in the oven and is baked alive in 'Hansel and
Gretel.' At the end of World War II, allied commanders banned the
publication of the Grimm tales in Germany in the belief that they had
contributed to Nazi savagery. For a long period, 
the tales were largely
banned from the German nursery, but in 2012 the 200th anniversary of
the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Die Kinder und
Hausmärchen</span> launched the 2013 celebrations of the brothers.&nbsp;
