<p>Swedish movie and theatre director, playwright, screenwriter.
Although Bergman was widely known as a film director, he also became
one of the foreground figures of the modern Swedish theatre. Bergman's
artistic career included stage performances, radio productions, feature
films, and TV productions. In several books, from <i>The Magic Lantern</i> (1987) to <i>Private Conversations</i> (1996) Bergman explored his childhood, his relationship to his father, and the strained marriage of his parents.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I want very much to tell, to talk about,
the wholeness inside every human being. It's a strange thing that every
human being has a sort of dignity or wholeness in him, and out of that
develops relationships to other human beings, tensions,
misunderstandings, tenderness, coming in contact, touching and being
touched, the cutting off of a contact and what happens then."</b> (Bergman in John Simon's book </font><i><font size="2">Ingmar Bergman Directs</font></i><font size="2">, 1972) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>Ingmar Bergman was born in 
<a href="http://www.uppsala.se/">Uppsala</a>, the son of Erik Bergman,
a Lutheran minister and chaplain to the court of Sweden, and Karin
Bergman (née Åkerblom), who came from a prosperous family. In 2011
Bergman's niece&nbsp;Veronica Ralston claimed in her book <em>Kärleksbarnet och bortbytingen</em>,
that&nbsp;the director's&nbsp;real mother was Hedvig Sjöberg, with whom
Erik had a relationship. Bergman was switched at birth with Karin's
baby who had died. However, the DNA tests carried out on two stamps
claimed to prove this were false: a lab technician's DNA&nbsp;had
contaminated the samples. </p><p>Bergman was raised under strict
discipline. Karin&nbsp;was a proud, strong-willed person, and the
relationship between his parents became mutually destructive."Mother,
You are my best friend," Bergman wroto to her years later, as a
grown-up man. From his childhood pressures Bergman later drew material
for his plays and films. Many of Bergman's works explored the
father-god trauma, including the films <i>Through a Glass Darkly</i> (1961) and <i>Winter Light</i> (1963). 

</p>
<p>At the age of 10 Bergman received a <i>laterna magica</i> as a toy. He made dolls for his puppet theater and saw in 1935 his first theater production, <i>A Dream Play</i>
by August Strindberg. Bergman studied literature and art at the
University of Stockholm. After graduation, he worked as a
trainee-director at a Stockholm theater. During this period he
published a few short stories and wrote a number of plays including<i> Kaspers död (1942) </i>and<i> Jack among the Actors</i>
(1946). At the age of twenty-six Bergman became the youngest theatre
manager in Europe at the Hälsingborg City Theatre in Sweden. He secured
his position through a large number of impressive productions,
especially classical plays. Bergman was manager of the <a href="http://www.helsingborg.se/">Helsingborg</a> city theatre (1944-46), director at 
<a href="http://www.goteborg.se/">Gothenburg</a> city theatre (1946-49), at <a href="http://www.malmo.se/">Malmö </a>city theatre (1953-60) and at 
the <a href="http://www.dramaten.se/">Dramaten</a> in <a href="http://www.stockholm.se/">Stockholm</a> (1960-66), the last three years as manager.

</p>
<p>Bergman&nbsp;made his debut&nbsp;in 1944 as a screenwriter to the Alf Sjöberg 
<i>Hets</i> (Frenzy). <i>Fängelse </i>
(1949, The Devil's Wanton), shot in two-and-a-half weeks, was the first
film Bergman both wrote and directed. Swedish critics referred Bergman
as "the puberty crisis director" specializing in "delayed adolescence".
The artistic breakthrough came with <i>Gycklarnas afton</i> (1953, Sawdust and Tinsel), in which Bergman
described an artist's life as despised and wasted. The background is a
third class circus environment. "It is true people often talk about
'decisive moments,'" Bergan said once. "Dramatists in particular make
much of this fiction. The truth is probably that such moments hardly
exist, but just looks as if they do... The actual breakthrough is a
fact far back in the past, far back in obscurity."<font size="2"><b> </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Private Conversations</font></i><font size="2">, 1996) </font>

</p>
<p>Bergman's first international success was <i>Sommarnattens leende </i>
(1955, Smiles of the Summer Night). In the story, which begins
realistically but has a kind of fairy tale ending, a country lawyer
meets again a touring actress who was once his mistress. He accepts an
invitation for him and his young wife to stay at her mother's country
home for a weekend. <i>Wild Strawberries</i>
(1957) is considered a landmark film in Bergman's career. It dealt with
the subject of man's isolation, and like in several films, Bergman used
a journey as a plot structure. <i>The Seventh Seal</i> (1957), shot in
only 35 days, won prizes at the Cannes Film Festival. This medieval
road movie explored the individual's relationship with God and the idea
of Death. In the story, set in the fourteenth century, a knight
challenges Death to a game of chess. Over the years Max von Sydow, the
knight, came to be identified as Bergman's on-screen <i>alter ego</i>. However, von Sydow has played also in action movies. </p>
<p>Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Liv Ullmann
were Bergman's favorite actresses and Sven Nykvist his regular
cameraman. Ullmann, his muse, later left the island of Farö, where they
lived, and gained international stardom. Their daughter Linn became as
a novelist. In 1971 Bergman married Ingrid von Rosen; they had already
had an affair in the late 1950s. Bergman had four previous marriages:
with Else Fisher, Ellen Lundström, Gun Grut, and Käbi Laretei. Ingrid
von Rosen died of cancer in 1995. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Film as dream, film as music. No for of
art goes beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to pour
emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul. A little twitch in
our optic nerve, a shock effect: twenty-four illuminated frames in a
second, darkness in between, the optic nerve incapable of registering
darkness. At the editing table, when I run the trip of film through,
frame by frame, I still feel that dizzy sense of magic of my childhood:
in the darkness of the wardrobe, I slowly wind one frame after another,
see almost imperceptible changes, wind faster - a movement."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Magical Lantern</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font></blockquote>

<p>Recurrent themes in Bergman's films are men's and women's inability
to communicate with each other, metaphysical questions of guilt and the
existence of God, and the emotional cruelty of human beings. "For many
years, I was on Hitler's side, delighted by his success and saddened by
his defeats," Bergman revealed from his youth. Already from his early
play <i>Jack among the Actors</i>, Bergman showed his interest in the ambiguous tension between artist and public. <i>Persona</i>
(1966) marked Bergman's departure from metaphysics toward the realm of
human psychology. At that time Bergman was leaving his post at the
Royal Dramatic Theater. He wrote the script in 1965 while hospitalized;
withdrawal and illness were also subjects of the film. In his
self-analysis and works on tensions between the sexes Bergman has
continued the psychological tradition of <a href="strindbe.htm">Strindberg</a>. Among Bergman's most probing and honest studies of middle-class married couples from the 1970s is <i>Scenes from a Marriage </i>(1974),
starring Liv Ullmann, Erland Josephson, Bibi Anderson, and Jan Malmsjö.
Originally it was made as six TV episodes, but Bergman later edited it
into feature-length.</p>
<p>Despite Bergman's international status, his films were not always
positively received by Swedish critics. In 1962 the director Bo
Widerberg published a pamphlet attacking him for reinforcing national
stereotypes and calling for a new and more socially conscious national
cinema. On the other hand, <i>Summer with Monika</i> (1953) was
attacked in the United States. Its prints were confiscated in Los
Angeles, and a judge declared that the film appealed to potential sex
murderers. <i>Smiles of the Summer Night</i> was promoted as "a
Swedish smorgasbord of sex, sin and psychiatry..." In the 1970s and
1980s feminists criticized Bergman's portrayal of women, although he
has been considered among the most sensitive interpreters of the inner
world of women in Europe. On artistic level the French film theorist
Jean Mitry considers <i>The Silence</i> (1963) the perfect example of
anticinema, a literary film, embodying everything which should be
avoided. "Then we have one of the sisters masturbating while down in
the street a tank which has been rolling through the town completely on
its own comes to halt, coincidentally right underneath of the windows
of her bedroom. No need to mention the sexual symbolism of the tank's
gun pointed in the direction of the bedroom, by why on earth should
that particular tank be rolling through the streets on its own, except
to create its petty effect and to symbolize symbolically a symbolic
menace? Etc."<font size="2"><b> </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Aesthetics and Psychology of the Cinema</font></i><font size="2">, 1997)</font></p>
<p>In 1976 Bergman was arrested by two policeman and charged with income-tax fraud. He suffered a 
nervous breakdown, closed his studio on the Baltic island of Fårö, and left Sweden in protest. 
The charges were later dropped. Bergman made his home in Munich, where he was a director at the 
Residenztheater. <i>The Serpent's Egg</i> (1977), which was filmed in English, dealt with the collapse of the German currency, 
and other events of the 1920s that paved the way for the Nazis, rise out of Bergman's frustration 
with the orderly society ande its subordination of the individual. </p>
<p>Bergman once noted that the cinema was like an exciting mistress to him, but the theatre was his 
faithful wife. As a film director his greatest international success was the autobiographical <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> (1982), which received the Oscar for best foreign film.<font size="2"> (</font><b><font size="2">See also</font></b><font size="2">: </font><a href="jdonner.htm"><font size="2">Jörn Donner</font></a><font size="2">, exec. producer, Finnish writer, and director.)</font>
Reviews were in general positive, and Bergman was compared to Maz
Ophuls, Federico Fellini, and Luchino Visconti. However, Richard
Grenier wrote in <i>Commentary</i>: "I don't believe one word of this
'love' glup that runs from one end of the film to the other. When
Ingmar Bergman talked to me of God and death I respected him despite
his past political sympathies. But now that he's prattling on about
love, and gentle smiles, and fruit trees in bloom, I think something in
him snapped."<font size="2"> (September 1983) </font>In the story a
well-to-do Uppsala family comes together to celebrate Christmas 1907.
Statues come to life and the ghost of the departed mingle freely with
the living. Alexander, a 10-year old boy, clashes with ironclad dogma
and the icy Bishop Vergerus. </p>

<p>After returning to Sweden, Bergman wrote film scripts for Billie
August and Daniel Bergman and directed at the Royal Swedish Theatre.
The Swedish Film Institute launched a new Ingmar Bergman prize to be
awarded annually. In 1988 appeared Bergman's autobiography, <i>The Magic Lantern</i>. It was followed by his film memoir <i>Images: My Life in Film </i>(1993). Bergman's novel <i>The Best Intentions</i> (1993) was based on his parents' lives, and the screenplay for the 1992 film on the same subject. <i>Private Conversations</i> (1996) dealt with the extra-marital affair of Ingmar's mother, Anna with a student-priest, Thomas. </p>

<p>In October 2001 Bergman announced his plans to make a sequel to <i>Scenes from a Marriage</i>
with the 78-year old Erland Josephson and the 62-year old Liv Ullmann
who also were members of the original cast in 1973. He wrote the
screenplay for Liv Ullmann's film <i>Faithless</i> (2000) and two years later Bergman had a new television production under way<font face="Symbol"> - </font><i>Saraband</i> (2003), saying it would be his last picture. Bergman shot the chamber piece on digital video. "<i>Saraband</i>
may be Bergman's final primal scream, which his art and craft give the
severe majesty of a Bach sello suite," wrote Richard Corliss in <i>Time</i><font size="2"> (August 29, 2005). </font>The
last period of his Bergman spent his time on Farö mostly reading and
talking with his friends on the phone. Bergman died on July 30, 2007,
on Farö, at the age of 89 . </p>
