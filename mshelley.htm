<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English Romantic novelist, biographer and 
editor, best known as the writer of <EM>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</EM> (1818). Mary Shelley was 21 when the book was published; she started to write it when she was 18. The story deals with an ambitious young scientist. He creates life but then rejects his creation, a monster.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"But success shall crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have gone, tracking a secure way over the pathless seas: the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?"</B> (from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Frankenstein</FONT></I><FONT size=2>) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was born in London. Her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, 
died of puerperal fever 10 days after giving birth to her daughter. Mary's labor lasted 18 hours and then it took four hours to remove the rest of the placenta. She was one of the first feminists, the author of <I>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</I> (1792), and the novel <I>The Wrongs of Woman</I>, in which she wrote: "We cannot, without depraving our minds, endeavour to please a lover or husband, but in proportion as he pleases us." In the intellectual circles of London, her acquaintances included the painter <A href="fuseli.htm">Henry Fuseli</A>, Erasmus Darwin, Charles's grandfather, and <A href="wblake.htm">William Blake</A>, who illustrated an edition of her book, <I>Original Stories from Real Life</I>. Fuseli showed her how to dress more fashionable; he eventually left her to marry one of his models. </P>
<P>Mary Shelley's father was 
the writer and political journalist William Godwin, who became famous with 
his work <I>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</I> (1793). Godwin had revolutionary attitudes to most social institutions, including marriage. In feminism he found an "amazonian" element. Among his 
other books is <I>Things as They Are, or The Adventures of Caleb 
Williams</I> (1794).</P>

<P>In her childhood Mary Shelley was left to educate herself amongst her 
father's intellectual circle, the critic Hazlitt, the essayist Lamb, the poet Coleridge and <A href="../../../pshelley.htm">Percy Bysshe Shelley</A>, who came into Godwin's circle in 1812. Her first poem she published at the age of 
ten. Godwin remarried&nbsp;in 1801, but Mary never learned to like her stepmother, Mary Jane Clairmont. In 1812&nbsp;she was sent to live&nbsp;in Dundee. At the 
age of 16 she ran away to France and Switzerland with 
Shelley; they had met at the end of 1812. Percy and Mary married in 1816&nbsp;– Shelley's wife Harriet had committed suicide by drowning. Their first child, a daughter, died in Venice, Italy, a few years later. In <EM>History of a Six Weeks' Tour </EM>(1817) the Shelleys jointly recorded their life. Thereafter 
they returned to England and Mary gave birth to a son, William.</P>

<P>The story of Frankenstein 
started in 1816, when Mary joined <A href="../../../byron.htm">Lord Byron</A>&nbsp;with Percy Shelley and Claire 
Clairmont in the Villa Diodati, in Switzerland,&nbsp;on the shore of Lake&nbsp;Geneva. On a stormy night in June, she took a 
challenge, set by Byron, to write a ghost 
story. Byron was the most famous English poet of the time, while Shelley's work was not not known outside a&nbsp;small circle of literary friends. Also another myth emerged from the challenge, <EM>The Vampyre</EM>, written by Dr. Polidori, Byron's friend. &nbsp;</P><P>With her husband's encouragement,&nbsp;Mary completed the novel within a year. At the Villa Diodati she had been a "silent listener" of her husband and Byron, who discussed about galvanism. At Eton College Shelley had become interested in Luigi Calvani's experiments with electric shocks to make dead frogs' muscles twitch. It is possible that his teacher, James Lind, had demonstrated the technique to Shelley. Byron and Shelley talked Dr Darwin's experiments with a piece of vermicelli. In her 'Introduction' to the 1831 edition Mary revealed that she got the story from a dream, in which she saw "the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with a uneasy, half vital motion."</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</STRONG> (1818) <B></B>The novel start with series of letters from Robert Walton to his sister. Walton is an English Arctic explorer who spots a strange creature on a dog-sled. The exhausted Victor Frankenstein arrives, in pursuit of the creature, and while recuperating tells his story. He has been born into a wealthy Geneva family. After his mother dies of scarlet fever he becomes a student of natural philosophy and medicine. Inspired by occult philosophy and the teaching of his mentor, Waldman, he builds a creature in the 
semblance of a man and gives it life. Its body is assembled from parts which Frankenstein has stolen from butcher shops, dissecting rooms, and charnel-houses. The creature is repeatedly rejected by 
those who see it, but proves to be&nbsp;intelligent, and later highly articulate and 
embittered with life. Frankenstein deserts his 
creation, who disappears.<FONT size=2> </FONT>"I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I have deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I have finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart."<FONT size=2> (from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Frankenstein</FONT></I><FONT size=2>)</FONT></P><P>Frankenstein hears that his younger brother has been strangled, but Justine, his family's servant confesses the murder. However, later the monster tells that he murdered William and framed Justine. Frankenstein then agrees to make a mate for the monster so that it will not bother anyone again. A wave of remorse makes him 
destroy the female. The lone creature swears revenge. He kills Frankenstein's 
bride, Elizabeth, on their wedding night. The scientist becomes mad, but recovers and 
chases the creature across the world. The two confront in the Arctic wastes. Frankenstein dies. The creature describes eloquently to Walton his efforts to seek out beauty and how crime has degraded it beneath the meanest animal.<B> </B>"He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars, or feel the wind play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness." The monster leaps from the ship on a ice-raft, disappearing again in the darkness. <BR></P><P>The novel contains no supernatural elements; the creation of the monster is described in the third edition on a rational scientific basis. Frankenstein is a scientist who challenges the Creator of the world with the possibilities of modern science, but is destroyed because he cannot anticipate the outcomes of his own acts. The story has also been interpreted as an exploration of the artist's&nbsp;– creator's&nbsp;– relation to society. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The first edition of book had an unsigned preface by Percy Shelley. Many 
thought that it is also his novel, disbelieving that only 19-year-old 
woman could write such horror story. However, when the book was 
published in 1818, it became a huge success, although it received mixed reviews. John Wilson Croker wrote in <I>Quaterly Review</I> (January 1818) that "the dreams of insanity are embodied in the strong and striking language of the insane, and the author, notwithstanding the rationality of his preface, often leaves us in doubt whether he is not as mad as his hero." Walter Scott, on the other hand, noted that the work was "written in plain and forcible English, without exhibiting the mixture of hyperbolical Germanisms with which tales of wonder are usually told" <FONT size=2>(</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, March 1818). </FONT></P>
<P>In 1818 the Shelleys left England for Italy, where they remained until 
Percy Shelley's death&nbsp;– he drowned during a heavy squall on July 28, 1822, in the Bay of Spezia near Livorno. In 
1819 Mary suffered a nervous breakdown after the death of William, who died of malaria at the age of 3. Mary had 
also lost a daughter the previous year. In 1822 she had a dangerous 
miscarriage and she believed that she would die. Mary Shelley wrote to her friend Maria Gisborne about this loss and her husband's death, concluding the letter: "Well here is my story&nbsp;– the last story I shall have to tell&nbsp;– all that might have been bright in my life is now despoiled&nbsp;– I shall live to improve myself, to take care of my child, &amp; render myself worthy to join him. soon my weary pilgrimage will begin&nbsp;– I rest now –&nbsp; but soon I must leave Italy – ".<B><FONT size=2> </FONT></B><FONT size=2></FONT>Of their children only one, Percy Florence, survived infancy. 
In 1823 Mary returned with her son to England, determined not to-re-marry. 
She devoted herself to his welfare and education and continued her career 
as a professional writer. Sir Timothy Shelley, her father-in-law, was not eager to help her and her son Percy financially. Mary Shelley never married, but she flirted with the young French writer <A href="merimee.htm">Prosper Merimee</A>, and hoped to marry Maj. Aubrey Beauclerk. </P>

<P>None of Shelley's novels from this period matched the power of her 
first legendary achievement. Her later works include <EM>Lodore</EM> (1835) and <EM>Falkner</EM> 
(1937), both romantic pot-boilers, and unfinished <EM>Mathilda</EM> (1819, published 1959), which draws on her relations with Godwin and Shelley. <EM>Valperga </EM>(1823) is a romance set in the 14th-century, and <EM>The Last Man</EM>&nbsp;(1826), set in the 21st century republican England, depicts the end of human civilization. Its second part describes the gradual destruction of the human race by plague. The narrator is Lionel Verney, the last man of the title, living amidst the ruins of Rome. Feminist critics have paid attention to its fantasy of the total corrosion of patriarchal order. </P>

<P>Shelley gave up writing long fiction when realism started to gain 
popularity, exemplified in the works of Charles Dickens. She wrote a numerous short stories for popular periodicals, particularly <I>The 
Keepsaker</I>, produced several volumes of <I>Lives</I> for Lardner's 
<I>Cabinet Cyclopedia</I>, and the first authoritative edition of Shelley's 
poems (1839, 4 vols.). Shelley's well-received travelogue <EM>Rambles in Germany and Italy, in 1840, 1842, and 1843</EM>&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1844. She also attempted a biography on Shelley but abandoned the work. </P>
<P>The story of Frankenstein's monster has inspired over 50 films. James Whale's version from 1931, starring Boris Karloff, is considered a classic, and became the major source for a number of other adaptations. The monster kills little Maria on the lake and is hunted down and destroyed. All reviews of the film were not positive: "I regret to report that it is just another movie, so thoroughly mixed with water as to have a horror content of about .0001 percent... The film differs greatly from the book and soon turns into a sort of comic opera with a range of cardboard mountains over which extras in French Revolution costumes dash about with flaming torches." <FONT size=2>(Creighton Peet in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Outlook &amp; Independent</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, December 9, 1931) </FONT>Mel Brook's parody <I>Young Frankenstein</I> (1974), starring Gene Wilder in the role of the famous doctor, was beautifully photographed&nbsp;– Brooks used many archaic optical devices, including the old 1:85 aspect ratio for height and width of the frame. The film received an Academy Award nomination for its script. Among its highlights is the scene in which Peter Boyle as the monster visits a well-meaning, lonely blind man, Gene Hackman, who nearly manages to destroy his guest. Kenneth's Branagh's&nbsp;adaptation <I>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</I> (1994) was faithful to the book. The director himself was Frankenstein and Robert De Niro played the monster under a heavy mask. </P>
