<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Internationally one the best-known poets of the post-Stalin period, who became with such work as <i>The Third Snow</i>
(1955) a spokesman for the young generation. Throughout the Khrushchev
and the Brezhnev periods Yevtushenko travelled widely abroad, giving
readings as a symbol of a new freedom in the Soviet Union. Especially
in the United States the 6-foot-3-inch Siberian poet received a great
deal of attention. Yevtushenko's early poems show the influence of <a href="majakovs.htm">Mayakovsky</a>. In spite of his outspokenness and conflicts with the authorities, he was also loyal to communism. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Why is it that in folk songs of all
nations and all ages people express the desire to become birds? Because
birds know no borders. People are mortally envious of animals for their
freedom, and probably that is why we try to deprive them of it by
forcing borders on them </b></font><font face="Symbol" size="2">-</font><font size="2"><b>
be they the barriers of zoo, the bars of a circus cage, or the
transparent but still prison-like walls of an aquarium. People insult
their one God-given planet with impassable fences (which Robert Frost
described with such a bitter irony) </b></font><font face="Symbol" size="2">-</font><font size="2"><b>
with barbed wire, with iron or newspaper curtain. The division, the
separation of the earth's surface, turns into mutual verbal and
physical cannibalism. Our lack of knowledge of each other is like that
of a blind sculptor, dangerous in his aggressive naiveté, who creates
figures of so-called enemies." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Divided Twins</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>Yevgeny Yevtushenko was born in Zima in Irkutsk, a fourth-generation
descendant of Ukrainians exiled to Siberia. In 1944 he moved with his
mother,&nbsp;Zinaida Ermolaevna Evtushenko to Moscow, where he studied
at the Gorky Institute of Literature.&nbsp; Yevtushenko's&nbsp;father,
Aleksandr&nbsp; Rudolfovich <em></em>Gangnus,&nbsp;was a geologist. Yevtushenko&nbsp; accompanied him on expeditions to Kazakhstan in 1948 and to Altai in 1950.</p><p><em>Zima Junction</em>, Yevtushenko's first important narrative poem, came out&nbsp;in 1956, but he gained international fame with <i>Babi Yar</i>,
in which he denounced the Nazis and at the same time clumsily
criticized his own country for forgetting the message of the
"Internationale". "But those with unclean hands / have often made a
jingle of your purest name. / I know the goodness of my land. / How
vile these anti-Semites&nbsp;&#8211; without a qualm / they pompously called
themselves / the Union of the Russian People." <em>Babi Yar</em> is
one of a number of literary treatments of a massacre of Jews in
occupied Kiev on 29 September 1941. Composer Dimitri Shostakovich set
the words to music as part of his <i>Thirteenth Symphony</i>. The poem
was not officially printed in Russia until 1984, although it was
frequently recited in both Russia and abroad. Vladimir Firsov, an
anti-experimentalis poet, argued that Yevtushenko sympathized more with
Jewish than Slavic victims. In 1963 Communist Party secretary Nikita
Khrushchev forced to add lines about the Slavic victims.</p>
<p>When the famous eighty-eight-year-old American poet Robert Frost visited the Soviet Union in 1962, 
he met Yevtushenko in Moscow. They went 
to the Café Aelita, where they drank Georgian wine and recited poetry. Later Frost said, "he was a lively, youngish man, 
and I got quite an impression of him, quite bohemian, and quite stirred up to heroic feelings about Cuba, and all 
that, for some more revolution." 

<i>The Heirs of Stalin </i>(1961), published presumably with Party approval in <i>Pravda</i>,
contained the warning that Stalin did not die. "And I appeal / to our
government with a plea: / to double, / and treble, the guard at this
slab, / so that Stalin will not rise again, / and with Stalin<font face="Symbol">-</font>the past." In a interview Yevtushenko confessed that he broke down in tears&nbsp;upon learning of the dictator's death in 1953.</p><p>Yevtushenko
dealt with burning topics of the day with a strong rhetorical note; its
has been said that most of Yevtushenko's political poems are bad verse
in a good cause. He demanded greater artistic freedom, and his attacks
on Stalinism and bureaucracy in the late 1950s and 60s made him a
leader of Soviet youth. As a correspondent for <i>Pravda</i>,
Yevtushenko visited Cuba, where befriended Fidel Castro,&nbsp;and wrote
with Enrique Piñeda Barnett the screenplay for Mikhail Kalatozov's
episodic film <i>Soy Cuba </i>(I Am Cuba), released two years after
the missile crisis in 1964. This propagandistic work fell soon into
obscurity, but decades later in was&nbsp; and hailed as a masterpiece
especially due to Sergei Urusevsky's innovative camerawork. </p>
<p>In December 1962 Nikita Khrushchev arranged an informal discussion
with Soviet intelligentsia, in which Yevtushenko defended the right of
artist and writers to decide on their own what art was. To&nbsp;
Khrushchev's remark, "If person is born ugly, only the grave will
correct him,"&nbsp; he replied: "Nikita Sergeevich, we live in a time
when mistakes are corrected not by graves, but by live, honest, and
truthful Bolshevik words." <br>
</p>
      <p>Yevtushenko was allowed to travel widely in the West until 1963. He then published <i>A Precocious Autobiography</i> in English, and his privileges and favors were withdrawn, but restored two years later. At the time of the 1968 Soviet
Invasion of Czechoslovakia, Yevtushenko was on vacation
in the Crimea with Vasily Aksyonov; Yevtushenko send a cable to Leonid Brezhnev in protest, Vasily Aksyonov drowed his rage in alcohol. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>He
also denounced the invasion in the poem 'Russian Tanks in Prague.'
However, this was not known in England, where his former friend Kingley
Amis joined a campaing against Yevtushenko, after he was nominated for
the poetry chair at Oxford. Yevtushenko did not get the post. </p>

<p>In 1972 Yevtushenko gained a huge success with his play <i>Under the Skin of the Statue of Liberty</i>,
which was produced in Moscow. Since the 1970s he has been active in
many fields of culture: writing novels, acting, film directing, and
photography. He directed the film <i>Kindergarten</i> and acted in it, and in 1990 he directed the film <i>Stalin's Funeral</i>. He has also remained politically outspoken. In 1974 supported <a href="alesol.htm">Solzhenitsyn</a>
when the Nobel Prize Winner was arrested and exiled. Yevtushenko sent
an immediate telegram of protest to Brezhnev, in which he said that
while he disagreed with Solzhenitsyn on many points, the author's
explosive study<i> Gulag</i> contained "terrible documented pages about the bloody crimes of the Stalinist past." </p>
<p>In the West Yevtushenko was often criticized for being too soft, but
the KGB records have shown him to have been working behind the scenes
in support of Solzhenitsyn. He wrote to KGB chief Yuri Andropov, the
future general secretary of the Communist Party: "There is only one way
out of this situation, but nobody will dare choose it: recognize
Solzhenitsyn, restore his membership in the Writers' Union, and
afterward, just declare suddenly that <i>Cancer Ward</i> is to be
published." Later he also suggested that Boris Pasternak's Nobel Prize
for Literature, which the author had rejected under pressure of the
Soviet Government, should be posthumously restored. "He earned it with
his entire life and work," Yevtushenko wrote in an article. His own
speeches were constantly censored in magazines. </p><p>In 1985, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev had just risen to power, <i>Literaturnaya Gazeta</i>,
published by the Soviet Writers' Union, left out several major sections
of Yevtushenko's remarks about Stalin's purges, the evils of
collectivization, and the privileges of the elite. Yevtushenko himself
declined to criticize the editing.</p>
<p>Yevtushenko's first novel <i>Wild Berries</i> (1981),
was&nbsp;rejected by critics but it became a huge success. In the
story, which fused the past and the future, history and fantasy,
Yevtushenko dealt among other things with the Stalinist
collectivization of agriculture and the elimination of the kulaks,
land-owning peasants. As a result, the author was advised to stick to
poetry. In 1989 Yevtushenko became a member of the Congress of People's
Deputies and next year he was appointed vice president of Russian PEN. </p><p>When Yevtushenko was appointed in 1987 honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Russian-born poet <a href="brodsky.htm">Joseph Brodsky</a> resigned in protest <font face="Symbol">- </font>he
considered his colleague a party yes man. Brodsky bitterly stated: "He
throws stones only in directions that are officially sanctioned and
approved." Yevtushenko's readers, however, have defended the poet
faithfully, stating that "you can't blame him that he survived." In
1993 Yevtushenko received a medal as 'Defender of Free Russia,' which
was given to those who took part in resisting the hard-line Communist
coup in August 1991. </p>
<p>After the accession of Gorbachev to power, Yevtushenko introduced to
Soviet readers many poets repressed by Stalin in the journal <i>Ogonek</i>.
He aroused public awareness of the pollution of Lake Baikal, and when
communism collapsed, he supported the plan to erect a monument to the
victims of Stalinist repression opposite Lubianka, headquarters of the
KGB. In <i>Don't Die Before You're Dead</i> (1995) Yevtushenko gave
his satirical account of the August 1991 coup, which eventually lifted
Boris Yeltsin to power. In one scene the slain Grand Duchess Olga
whispers her last poems into Yeltsin's ear. </p>
<p>Yevtushenko has been married four times: in 1954 he married Bella
Akhmadulina, who published her first collection of lyrics in 1962.
After divorce he married&nbsp; Galina Semyonovna Sokol. Yevtushenko's
third wife was the British translator Jan Butler; they married in 1978.
Butler worked as a translator in Moscow for thirteen years.
In&nbsp;1986&nbsp;Yevtushenko marrried Maria Novika. Since 1994,
Yevtushenko has been a professor at the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma,
where he has taught poetry and film. His criticism of&nbsp; President
Vladimir Putin&nbsp;has been mild compared to the dramatic impact he
made with his attacks on the legacy of Stalinist cultural policy. </p>
