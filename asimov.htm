</p>
      <p>Highly prolific American  writer, one of the three grand masters of science  fiction with <a href="aclarke.htm">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href="heinlein.htm">Robert A. Heinlein</a>. For five decades Isaac Asimov was one of the central figures of science fiction.  His  popular works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Nightfall&nbsp;</span> (1941), <span style="font-style: italic;">Foundation</span> (1951), <span style="font-style: italic;">Foundation and Empire</span> (1952), <span style="font-style: italic;">Second Foundation</span> (1953), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Caves of Steel</span> (1954), <span style="font-style: italic;">The End of Eternity</span> (1955), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Naked Sun</span> (1957), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gods Themselves</span> (1972), which won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards. 
      </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I received the fundamentals of my education in school, but that was not enough. My <i>real</i>
education, the superstructure, the details, the true architecture, I
got out of the public library. For an impoverished child whose family
could not afford to buy books, the library was the open door to wonder
and achievement, and I can never be sufficiently grateful that I had
the wit to charge through that door and make the most of it."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">I. Asimov</font></i><font size="2">, 1994) </font></blockquote>

<p>Isaac Asimov was born in Petrovichi, Russia, the son of Judah Asimov
and Anna Rachel Berman Asimov. His father was educated within the
limits of Orthodox Judaism, but religion did not play a central role in
Isaac's childhood. "He didn't even bother to have me bar mitzvahed at
the ago of thirteen," Asimov remarked later. Judah Asimov was well read
in Russian literature, but especially he loved Sholem Aleichem's
Yiddish stories. During World War I he served in the Russian Army. In
1923 the family moved to the United States, and settled in New York.
Before opening a sweet-shop, Judah worked in odd jobs, and learned also
to speak English. In old age, when he retired to Florida, he became
Orthodox again. Asimov himself never learned Russian, and the culture
of his parents' native country remained him distant. </p>
<p>Asimov could read before he entered the first grade. He also had "a
near-photographic memory." At school Asimov finished books in a few
days. His father got him a library card, but did not supervise the
books his son read. A classic "bookworm", Asimov devoured early works
on Greek mythology, the <i>Iliad</i>, William Shakespeare plays, history books, all kinds of miscellaneous reading. One library was not enough <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he used to go to every one within reach. After leaving Boys High School
in Brooklyn, an elite school in those days, Asimov studied chemistry at
Columbia University, New York, where he graduated in 1939 and received
his M.A. in 1941. </p>
<p>In 1942 Asimov married Gertrude Blugerman; they had two children. The marriage was not easy <font face="Symbol">-</font>
"sex didn't work out too well", recalled Asimov, "with neither of us
possessing experience." She also smoked. During WW II Asimov worked in
the US Naval Air Experimental Station alongside such science fiction
writers as L. Sprague de Camp, who, according to Asimov, had "something
very British about his appearance", and Robert A. Heinlein, who made
Asimov feel "particularly gauche" with his courtly way. Asimov's
relationship with Heinlein became later somewhat strained. He believed
that Heinlein, a liberal during the war, adopted "rock-ribbed far-right
conservative" attitudes afterwards under the influence of his wife. At
the NAES Asimov remained from 1942 to 1945. After the end of the war
Asimov served in the army as a corporal <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he received his draft notice in September 1945. Asimov served eight
months and twenty-six days. In 1948 he received his Ph. in
biochemistry from Columbia University. Asimov's pseudo-dissertation,
'The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline', was
published in 1948 in <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>. </p>
<p>In 1949 Asimov joined the Boston University School of Medicine,
where he was made an associate professor of biochemistry in 1955.
Asimov was one of the best lecturers at the university, but after 1958
he taught only from time to time. Research did not interest him much.
"As far as I know, not a single research paper to which my name was
attached ever proved of the slightest importance," Asimov said. He
devoted himself to writing and focused mostly on non-fiction,
publishing such works as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science </span>(1960),
and books on history and literary topics. Asimov remained an associate
professor until 1979, and subsequently held the title of professor. </p>
<p><font size="2"> </font>Asimov married in 1973 the writer and
psychoanalyst Janet Opal Jeppson. He had met her already in the 1950s.
During the following years, Asimov saw her from time to time on his
visits to New York. Correspondence with her convinced Asimov that she
was the kind of person that suited him perfectly. Janet Jeppson began
to write science fiction in the 1970, most of it for children. Her
early works she published under the name J.O. Jeppson. Among her books
are <i>The Second Experiment </i>(1974), <i>The Last Immortal</i> (1980), <i>Laughing Space</i> (anthology, 1982), <i>The Mysterious Cure, and Other Stories of Pshrinks Anonymous</i> (1985), and <i>Mind Transfer</i> (1988). For young readers she created in collaboration with Isaac Asimov  the <i>Norby Chronicles</i>, which depicted the adventures of a robot.</p>
<p>"Since I am an atheist and do not believe that either God or Satan,
Heaven or Hell, exists, I can only suppose that when I die, there will
only be an eternity of nothingness to follow." (from <i>I. Asimov</i>)
Asimov had in 1977 a heart attack and in 1983 he had triple bypass
surgery. Given a blood transfusion, he contracted the HIV virus, which
was not discovered until 1990. The doctors adviced against going public
on this; Janet Asimov tested negative. The winter of 1989-90 Asimov
spent in a hospital due to a congenital weakness of the mitral valve in
the heart. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Forward the Foundation</span>
(1993) Asimov said farewell to Hari Seldon. Asimov's heart and kidney
failure worsened and he died at New York University Hospital on April
6, 1992. </p>

<p>Asimov began to write at the age of eleven. When he worked at his
father's store, he became interested in pulp magazines, and imitated
their language in his early works. At the age of 18 Asimov sold his
first story, 'Marooned Off Vesta'. One of the magazines, which printed
his tales, was <i>Astounding Science Fiction. </i>It was<i> </i>edited
by John W. Campbell Jr, who encouraged and trained many of the field's
rising writers. Fredrik Pohl, a few weeks older than Asimov, edited <i>Astonishing Stories </i>and <i>Super Science Stories</i>, both of which bought several of Asimov's stories. Asimov's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Pebble in the Sky</span> (1950), was published by Doubleday. The first nonfiction book Asimov wrote for the general public, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Chemicals of Life</span> (1954), was published by Abelard-Schuman. </p>

<p>Asimov's breakthrough work,  'Nightfall' (1941), is acclaimed to be the best science 
fiction story ever written <font face="Symbol">-</font>
an overstatement of course. The poetic story depicts a world which has
six suns, at least one of which is always shining. The world have
experienced a universal eclipse every two millennia, and lost its
social organization as a result. When the darkness falls the reason for
this cyclical development is revealed: suddenly the thousands of stars
are visible. Most of Asimov's books are pure adventure, and good
entertainment, often giving solutions to all kinds of problems of human
society and technology. Among his most popular works are the Foundation
novels <font face="Symbol">-</font> based very very loosely on Edward Gibbon's <i>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> <font face="Symbol">-</font> and Robot novels and stories.</p>

<p>The first <i>Foundation</i> trilogy is perhaps the most impressive of Asimov's achievements. Set in the far future, 
the space opera depicts the period between the fall and the rise a new Galactic Empire. Hari Seldon, the mysterious 
inventor of psychohistory, has established two Foundations to control  this development. The first 'Foundation' 
is public and based on the physical sciences. But there is also a second Foundation, which is secret. It copes 
with the unknown factors, which Hari Seldon could not have anticipated. The grand scheme is thrown away when 
the "Mule", a mutant warlord, comes on the scene. Using his ability to manipulate minds by direct 
force, the Mule gives history a new direction. According to the science of psychohistory, the behaviour of 
humans in the mass can be predicted by purely statistical means <font face="Symbol">-</font> if the human 
conglomerate is unaware of the psychohistoric analysis and act randomly. The third part of the trilogy 
concerns the efforts of the Second Foundation both to get history back on course and to avoid detection 
and destruction by the First, which perceives it as a rival. Outside this epic future history Asimov 
wrote <i>The End of Eternity</i>, which examined the paradoxes of time travel. </p>
<p>In the 1960s Asimov did not publish science fiction novels <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he felt it had passed beyond him. The "New Wave" was more experimental
and radical compared to the Golden Age tradition, but Asimov's works
still sold well. He returned to novels in 1980s and started the
ambitious project to amalgamate the <i>Robot</i> and <i>Foundation</i> sequences into one huge tale. The new books included <span style="font-style: italic;">Foundation's Edge</span> (1982), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Robots of Dawn</span> (1983),<span style="font-style: italic;"> Robots and Empire </span>(1985), <span style="font-style: italic;">Foundation and Earth</span> (1986), <span style="font-style: italic;">Prelude to Foundation&nbsp;</span> (1988), and <i>Forward the Foundation</i>
(1993), in which Hari Seldon struggles to create his twin foundations,
to preserve human civilization in the future of the Galaxy. In <i>Robots and Empire</i> (1985) R. Daneel Olivaw learns the tricks of telepathy, a step toward the Foundation. The <i>Second Foundations Trilogy</i> was a homage to Asimov's grand vision, beginning with <span style="font-style: italic;">Foundation's Fear</span> (1977) by Gregory Benford, and continuing with <span style="font-style: italic;">Foundation and Chaos</span> (1998) by Greg Bear, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Foundation's Triumph </span>(1999) by David Brin. </p>
<p><i>Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine</i> was founded by <i>Davis Magazines</i>.
It started to appear quaterly from 1977, monthly from 1979 and 4-weekly
from 1981. IASFM was a success from the start and its stories have won
an extraordinary high number of awards. Its title changed in 1992 to <i>Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine</i>,
when the magazine was sold to a new publisher. The actual editorial
work was done first by George Scithers and then by a succession of
other editors. Asimov himself wrote a 1,500-word editorial in every
issue, and answered letters. </p>
<p>Asimov's <i>Robot </i>stories were based on the Three Laws of
Robotics, a set of programmed instructions, introduced in the 'Liar!'
(1941), about a telepathic robot. Asimov formulated the laws with John
W. Campbell, Jr.: 1) a robot may not injure a human being or, through
inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2) a robot must obey the
orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict
the First Law; 3) a robot must protect its own existence as long as
such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Most of
Asimov's <i>Robot</i> stories, collected as <span style="font-style: italic;">I, Robot</span> (1950) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rest of the Robots </span>(1964), revolve around various interpretations of these laws. They are also basis for the novels <i>The Caves of Steel </i>(1954) and <i>The Naked Sun </i>(1957),
introducing the detective team of Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, a
humaniform robot. The books were set respectively on an overpopulated
Earth and barely populated colony world. </p>
<p>Asimov was extraordinarily prolific writer of a prodigious number of works including science fiction, 
science fact, mystery, history, short stories, guides to the Bible and Shakespeare, and discussions of myth, 
humor, poems, limericks, as well as annotations of literary works. Asimov authored nearly 500 books, but never wrote 
a screenplay for a major film. Several attempts have been made to adapt <i>Foundation</i> trilogy for the screen. 
TriStar Pictures purchased its rights in 1994, but then sold them to New Line. Dennis Feldman was assigned to work on 
a script, which would cover the first novel. </p>

<p>Asimov's strength as a fiction writer was in his great skill to
develop logically interesting ideas within a conventional story frame,
which did not have much sensual or visual references. His critics noted
that the stories resembled "a diagram on a blackboard", as Brian Aldiss
and David Wingrove described Asimov's Empire in<i> Trillion Year Spree </i>(2001).
" I make no effort to write poetically or in a high literary style,"
Asimov admitted. Usually he sat down at his old Selectronic III IBM
typewriter from 7:30 until 10 P.M. <font face="Symbol">-</font> the word processor he used only for the preparation of manuscripts. His autobiographies, <span style="font-style: italic;">In Memory Yet Green</span> (1979) and <span style="font-style: italic;">In Joy Still Felt </span>(1980), give a detailed picture of the enormously popular author. <span style="font-style: italic;">I. Asimov</span>
(1994) was a collection of vivid sketches of important people and
events in his life. Asimov had ended the manuscript with hope that he
would see it published before his death. It appeared posthumously. The
completed manuscript was edited by Janet Asimov. </p>
