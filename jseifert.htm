      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Poet and journalist who
was the
first Czech to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1984. Seifert was
the last great representative of Czech avant-garde. He published over
30 collections of poems. Not only acknowledged for his poetical
production, Seifert also became as symbol of freedom of expression. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"... poetry has occupied a very
important position in our cultural life. It is as though poetry, lyrics
were predestined not only to speak to people very closely... but also
to be our deepest and safest refuge, where we seek succor in
adversities we sometimes dare not even name." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Nobel lecture</font></i><font size="2">, 1984) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Jaroslav Seifert was born in Zizkov, a working-class suburb of
Prague, into a poor family. His father was a manager of a small general
store. To help him, Seifert spent his afternoons delivering goods to
customers throughout Prague. In Seifert's youth, the Russian Revolution
of 1917 played a key role in the development of his political
consciousness, and he enthusiastically embraced socialist ideals. As a
result, and to start his career as a journalist, Seifert dropped his
high school studies, and worked for the Communist party newspaper <i>Rudé
Pravo</i>. </p>
      <p>In 1923 Seifert made his first journey to Paris and adopted
there new literary ideas. Influenced by the French writer <a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/apollina.htm">Giullaume Apollinaire</a>, he helped to found with the art theorist and critic Karel Teige an avant-garde literary movement called Dev&#283;tsil, which urged alliance with revolutionary soldiers. The name of the
movement, referring to a medicinal herb or wildflower, was taken from a story by the &#268;apek brothers. <br>
</p>
      <p>Seifert's early books reflected his ideological stance, sympathy for revolution, streetwise pride, and Epicurean<b> </b>joie de vivre.
The poet Franti&#353;ek Halas, Seifert's close friend, described their first
meeting: "Across the street I see someone walking with a sailor'
stride. A warm scarf instead of a detachable collar, a pipe; he spits
continually. In those days a poet inevitably looked like that." <i>M&#283;sto v slzách</i>  (1921, City in Tears) was on the side of proletarian revolution and future happiness for the poor. <br>
</p>
      <p><span class="ft"><em>Samá láska</em> </span>(1923) expressed Seifert's optimism and desire to rebuild the world anew, as <em>Svatební cesta</em> (1925). <i>Slavík zpívá &#353;patn&#283;</i>  (1926, The Nightingale Sings Badly), published
after a journey to the U.S.S.R., was inspired by Dada and
Surrealism. This collection was labelled with a short-lined, rhymed stanza<font face="Symbol">-</font>the language of slogans and political agitation,
familiar from the works of Vladimir Mayakovsky. In later poems Seifert
came to rely less and less on puns and wordplay, which in general are
not easy to translate into other languages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Besides writing for newspapers and magazines, Seifert worked in a Communist bookshop and publishing house in Prague. In 1928 he
married Marie Ulrichová; they had two children. Seifert was among those who refused to follow
Klement Gottwald's Moskow-inspired line of systematic opposition to the
legitimacy of the Czechoslovak Republic. During the years, Seifert had
developed a critical attitude toward socialism, and his visit in the
Soviet Union did not increase his enthusiasm about Communism.
Eventually he was expelled from the Communist Party and the Dev&#283;tsil
collective. </p>
      <p><span class="ft">Seifert became in 1930 an editor in chief of
theater monthly <em>Nova Scena</em>. He also contributed to newspapers
throughout the 1930s and 1940s. <em>Jablko z klína</em></span>&nbsp;(1933)
marked the emergence of his new style, in which he uses almost
colloquial language and natural images. A number of the poems dealt
with love<font face="Symbol">-</font>it was a dominant subject also in <em>Ruce
Venu&#353;iny</em> (1936). Ideologically Seifert approached the Social
Democrats, who worked inside the parliamentary democracy. Also as a
poet Seifert went through the process of renewal: he searched
inspiration from the Czech poetic tradition, evoking a
quasi-mythological mother figure, and drawing on the experiences of
everyday life. In June 1939 he settled with his family&nbsp;in the
quiet suburb of Brevnov, where he lived until his death, surrounded by
his extensive cactus collection. </p>
      <p><i>Zhasn&#283;te sv&#283;tla</i><span class="ft"><em></em>&nbsp;</span>(1938, Put
Out the Lights) came out after the betrayal of Czechoslovakia at
Munich. The title work, about the Nazi threat hanging over Prague, is
one of his most famous poems. During the Nazi conquest of
Czechoslovakia, Seifert continued to write poems that expressed the
anguish of his homeland. With<em> </em>V&#283;jí&#345; Bo&#382;eny N&#283;mcové<strong> </strong>(1940),
a passionate protest against the Nazi occupation of Prague, Seifert won
the confidence of the Communist Party for a time. <i>P&#345;ilba hlíny</i> (1945) celebrated the Prague uprising of 1945 against
the Nazis and earned Seifert the stature as a Czech national poet. He
identified himself fully with the people's grief, and interpreted the
commonly shared feelings of betrayal and hope for survival. In 1966 he
was named Poet of the Nation. </p>
      <p>From 1945 to 1949 Seifert edited the Trade Union daily <i>Práce</i>.
When Czechoslovakia came under pro-Soviet Communist domination, Seifert
returned to apolitical themes and wrote much children's literature.
After the Communist take over,&nbsp;he refused all compromise&nbsp;
Among others his <em>Morový sloup</em> (1977, trans. The Plague
Column) had to be published abroad. Seifert's poetry was attacked by a
party critic for sinking into subjectivism. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What's all this talk about grey
hair </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">and wisdom? </font><br>
        <font size="2">When the bush of life burns down </font><br>
        <font size="2">experience is worthless. </font><br>
        <font size="2">Indeed it always has been." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Plague Column</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In the 1950s Seifert became a spokesman for artistic freedom
and criticized Government's cultural policies. "If a writer is silent,
he is lying,"<b><font size="2"> </font></b>he once said. However, <em>Maminka
      </em>(1954)<b> </b>received the State<b> </b>award.
In 1968
Seifert condemned the Soviet invasion of his country, which aimed to
stop all liberal tendencies. He was appointed president of the Writers
Union in 1969, but resigned shortly thereafter in protest of Soviet
oppression. During the early 1970s, his works circulated in underground
editions. Only selections from his old works were published inside
Czechoslovakia. In 1977 he signed among 500 others the Charter on Human
Rights and his works gained first time wider attention of
English-speaking readers. <em>Morový sloup</em> (The Plague Column),
which was published in the same year, was a single long poem. It used a
three-hundred-year-old Prague monument as a symbol for Czech fate and
history, and warned of the dangers of neo-Stalinism. "I believe that
seeking beautiful words is better than killing and murdering," Seifert
argued. </p>
      <p>Seifert's autobiography <i>V&#353;ecky krásy sv&#283;ta</i> (1981,
All the Beauty of the World) appeared abroad, in two émigré
publications, and led to the Nobel Prize. In this memoir Seifert
recreated the spirit of the Czech avant-garde between the two World
Wars and during the Nazi occupation. Too old and ill to travel to
Stockholm for the prize, the poet welcomed the news from his hospital
bed. The Government was not excited about the award, and refused to
give an exit permit to his son-in-law and secretary to go to Stockholm
in his behalf. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the late 1970s Seifert wrote in 'Finger Prints' (published
in <i>An Unbrella From Piccadilly</i>, 1985): "Perhaps I had committed
an offence against public morality, I don't know! I know nothing about
the law. Yet I was sentenced after all to lifelong punishment. If love
is a labyrinth full of glittering mirrors, and it is that, I'd crossed
its threshold and entered. And from the bewitching glitter of mirrors I
haven't found the way out to this day." Seifert
died in Prague on January 10, in 1986. As a People's Artist, Seifert
was entitled to a state funeral; it became a national event. </p>
