<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English poet, critic, and prolific
essayist, a philosophical anarchist and outspoken pacifist during World
War II. Read published over sixty books, of which a considerable number
is still in print. In the 1950s Read's reputation placed him alongside
such figures as <a href="tseliot.htm">T.S. Eliot</a> and George Orwell.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The only sin is ugliness, and if we
believed this with all our being, all other activities of the human
spirit could be left to take care of themselves. That is why I believe
that art is so much more significant than either economics or
philosophy. It is the direct measure of man's spiritual vision."</b> (from <i>The Meaning of Art</i>, 1968) </font></blockquote>
<p>Herbert Read was born in Kirbymoorside, North Riding of Yorkshire.
He descended from a long line of yeoman farmer. His first ten years
Read spent on the farm. After his father died, he was sent to a school
for orphans in Halifax. At the age of sixteen, he started to work as a
clerk in the Leeds Savings Bank. Through evening study, he was able to
enter the University of Leeds, where he studied from 1911 to 1914. </p>
<p>As a poet Read made his debut with <i>Songs of Chaos</i> (1915). It connected him with  the 
<a href="epound.htm">Imagists</a>, who believed that a hard, clear image was essential to verse. However, Read's 
poems were seldom typical for the movement, and his early career was cut short by the First World War. He served 
three years in the army, fighting in France and Belgium. In 1917 he was promoted to captain and in 1918 he 
received the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order. During the war, Read founded with Frank 
Rutter the journal <i>Arts and Letters</i>,  which attacked conservative values and published texts by such writers 
as Wyndham Lewis and T.S. Eliot. After demobilization, Read worked as an assistant principal of the Treasury, 
London. From 1922 to 1931 he was the assistant keeper of ceramics and stained glass at Victoria and Albert 
Museum. In London literary life, Read become a close friend of T.S. Eliot; they had first met in 1917. He   
contributed to the <i>Criterion </i>(1922-39) and he was many years a regular art critic for the <i>Listener</i>. 
He also edited various anthologies and works by T.E. Hulme, A.R. Orage, Kropotkin, 
and <a href="cjung.htm">C.G.Jung</a> &#8211; the psychoanalytical theories of Freud he rejected. </p>
<p>Read's first major work of literary criticism was <i>Reason and Romanticism</i> (1926), in which he started 
his lifelong wrestling between the antiromantic 'reason' and 'classicism' and the claims of 'emotion'. He  was 
the editor of the <i>Burlington Magazine </i>(1933-39), succeeding Fry, and from 1940 an editor of English 
Master Painters series. From the 1930s Read held various academic and also devoted much of his time to public 
affairs and art administration. In 1933 he helped organize the Unit 1 exhibition of contemporary art and the 
surrealist exhibition of 1936. Read frequently championed new artistic movements, earning an international 
reputation as a defender of modern art. Especially his writings about the sculptor Henry Moore had a great 
influence upon Anglo-American taste. </p>
<p>Read was a professor of fine art at Edinburgh University from 1931 to 1933, a lecturer in art at the 
University of Liverpool (1935-36), Leon Fellow at University of London (1940-42), and Charles Eliot Norton 
Professor of Poetry at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (1953-54). During World War II 
Read was responsive to the ideology of the 'people's war', which Evelyn 
Waugh saw as an effort to "direct the struggle for national survival into proletarian 
revolution". However, in accordance  with his anarchist political 
beliefs, Read argued in 
<i>To Hell with Culture</i> (1941)  
that "cultural institutions imposed on the masses are so much dead weight&#8212;to hell with such culture." 
After the war Read  cofounded with Roland Penrose and Eduardo Paolozzi the Institute for 
Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. Its aim was to down barriers between different artistic disciplines,  
to  serve as "an adult play-centre" and "a source of vitality and daring experiment". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The modern work of art, as I have said, is a symbol. The symbol, by 
its nature, is only intelligible to the initiated (though it may still appeal mysteriously to the 
uninitiated, so long as they allow it to enter their unconscious). The people can only understand 
the image, and even this they distrust in its eidetic purity, for even their vision is conventional. 
It does not seem that the contradiction which exists between the aristocratic function of art and the 
democratic structure of modern society can ever be resolved. But both may wear the cloak of humanism, 
the one for shelter, the other for display. The sensitive artist knows that a bitter wind is 
blowing."</b> (from <i>The Philosophy of Modern Art</i>, 1952) </font></blockquote>
<p>In a series of books, such as <i>The Meaning of Art</i> (1930), <i>Art Now </i>(1933), and 
<i>Art and Society</i> (1937) Read argued for 'organic form'  and the need for art in education. 
Read had adopted ideas from Freud, Jung, Hegel, Schiller, and Marx. He had developed disgust 
for the ugliness of industrialism, and denied that there is a "<i>necessary </i>connection 
between beauty and function". <i>English Prose Style </i>(1928) reflected his disillusionment 
with the post-war era and its false splendors. Read praised the the virtues of simplicity, even if 
it was often dry and flat &#8212; at least it conveyed a feeling of truthfulness. </p>
<p>In <i>Poetry and Anarchism </i>(1938) Read abandoned his earlier adherence to Marxist socialism, 
which was a disappointment for his leftist friends. Read was one of the earliest to practice 
psychoanalytical criticism. In <i>Collected Essays in Literary Criticism </i>(1938) he saw depth 
psychology necessary for understanding literary creation.  "I would say myself that there is 
no real contradiction between art, conceived as design, and the unconscious. The unconscious does, 
in fact, reveal design. Not only is the dream, when understood. a dramatic unity, but even in its 
plastic manifestations the unconscious possesses a principle of organization." Although Read 
wrote his essays  in an accessible, often didactic style, his poetry was deemed inaccessible 
by some critics. Read used striking images and complicated patterns of thought, the tone is 
editative or dramatic. Among his best works are 'The Analysis of Love' (1923), 'The End of a War' (1933), and  
'A World within a War' (1943).  His <i>Collected Poems</i> (1946) influenced the 'New Apocalypse' 
poets of the 1940s. Read's allegorical, fantastic novel  <i>The Green Child</i> (1935), about a 
journey through the self, is considered his most notable prose piece. In the story the hero rescues 
a green-skinned woman from her sadistic husband. She leads him back to her world via the millstream 
from wich she emerged. </p>
<p>His last years Read lived at Stonegrave house, Yorkshire, near to
where he had been born. He was knighted in 1953 by Winston Churchill
"for services to literature." His willingness to accept a knighthood
was a shock to other anarchists. He once remarked that "it is perfectly
possible, even normal, to live a life of contradictions." Read received
several awards, including Erasmus Prize (1966) for contributions to
European culture. He was president of the Institute of Contemporary
Arts, president of the British Society of Aesthetics, and trustee of
the Tate Gallery, among other positions. Read died on June 12, 1968. He
was married two times, first with Evelyn Roff; they had one son. After
divorce Read married in 1936 the musician Margaret Ludwig; they had
four children, one of whom is the well known novelist Piers Paul Read.
For years the Institute of Contemporary Arts held an annual Herbert
Read Lecture. Salman Rushdie, who had been "sentenced to death" by
Ayatollah Khomeini, was asked to deliver the 1990 lecture. Because he
was living with the threat of murder, the lecture,entitled 'Is Nothing Sacred,' 
was read by Harold Pinter. Rushdie argued that in an open society no
ideas, texts, even people could be ring-fenced and&nbsp; given the
immunity from challenges of all sorts. &nbsp; </p>
