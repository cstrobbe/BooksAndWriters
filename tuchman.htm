<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American writer, noted for her popular histories. Tuchman was praised for her lucid style, narrative power,
 and portrayal of the protagonists in world dramas as believable human beings.  
Meaning, in Tuchman's view, emerges not from preconceived design but from the 
aggregation of details and events that fall into a pattern. Tuchman was a two-time winner 
of the Pulitzer Prize. Her subjects varied from the Trojan War to the Vietnam War, 
from description of medieval daily life to the portraits of world leaders of the First 
World War. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A phenomenon noticeable throughout
history regardless of place or period is the pursuit of governments of
policies to their own interests. Mankind, it seems, makes a poorer
performance of government than of almost any human activity. In this
sphere, wisdom, which may be defended as the exercise of judgment
acting on experience, common sense and available information, is less
operative and more frustrated than it should be. Why does holders of
high office so often contrary to the way reason points and enlightened
self-interest suggest? Why does intelligent mental process seem so
often not to function?" </b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam</font></i><font size="2">, 1984) </font>

</blockquote>
<p>Barbara Tuchman was born in New York City. Her  grandfather, Henry Morgenthau Sr., 
was Woodrow Wilson's Ambassador to Turkey and her father, Maurice Wertheim, was a 
banker, who bought <i>The Nation</i> magazine from the Villards when it was on 
the verge of bankruptcy. 
Alma (Morgenthau) Wertheim (1887&#8211;1953), her mother, was a an accomplished 
vocalist and a music patron, who founded the Cos Cob Press to  
issue new scores; it later became Arrow Music Press. 
Aaron Copland dedicated the score of his Piano Concerto (1926) to 
her. 
Tuchman was educated at Radcliffe College and Cambridge, 
Mass. Her education at Radcliffe was in literature and 
history primarily, a combination which she later learned to be 
mutually benefical. From 1934 to 1935 she worked as a research assistant at the Institute of 
Pacific Relations in New York and Tokyo, and then started  her career as a journalist 
contributing to several magazines. Tuchman was the editorial assistant of 
<i>The Nation</i>, a staff writer of <i>War in Spain</i>, and an American 
correspondent of <i>New Statesman</i> in London (1939). In 1943, she 
began working for the Office of War Information in New York. </p>
<p>Tuchman's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lost British Policy</span>, came out in 1938, after 
the Loyalist had lost the Spanish Civil war, which she saw as the end of 
the liberal world. In 1939 she married Lester R. Tuchman, a physician; they had three 
children. Tuchman was a trustee at Radcliffe College (1960-72), a lecturer 
at Harvard University, University of California, U.S. Naval War College, 
and other institutions. In 1979 she was appointed the chairperson of 
American Academy of Arts and Letters. She also received  a number 
honorary degrees. Tuchman died on February 6, 1989. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Dead battles, like dead generals, 
hold the military mind in their dead grip and Germans, no less than 
other peoples, prepare for the last war."</b></font><font size="2"> 
(from <i>August 1914</i>) </font><i> </i></blockquote>
<p>Tuchman did not agree, that it is a great disadvantage of 
not having been trained as a historian. Labelled as a popular historian, she 
received both popular and critical acclaim for her style and vision 
&#8211; "I have always <i>felt</i> like an artist when I work on a book," she 
once said, "I see no reason why the word should always be confined to 
writers of fiction and poetry". Tuchman 
became first known in the 1960s with the publication 
of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Guns of August</span> (1962), a study of events leading up to 
World War I. It is generally considered  to be her best work, 
although many historians have contested her thesis  &#8211; 
that the outcome of the war was decided during the first month. 
"No more distressing moment can ever face a British government 
than that which requires it to come to a hard, fast and specific 
decision." <i>The Guns of August</i> traced the actions 
of statesmen and patriots alike in Berlin, London, St. Petersburg 
and Paris. "For one August in its history Paris was French &#8211; 
and silent."<font size="2"> 
(from </font><i><font size="2">August 1914</font></i><font size="2">, 1962) 
</font>The story of the first 30 days of the first global war won 
The Pulitzer Prize.  The most famous reader of Tuchman's work was 
President John F. Kennedy, an amateur historian himself. Also member of 
his administation had read it just before the outbreak of the 
1962 Cuban Missile 
Crisis. Copies of the book were placed in officers' day rooms 
around the world. Kennedy had telephoned Secretary of the Army Elvis Stahr Jr., 
saying, "I want you to read this. And I want every officer in the 
Army to read it." In Roger Donaldson's film <i>Thirteen Days</i> (2000), a truthful 
dramatization of crisis, Kennedy mentions Tuchmans' work, and 
compares the situation with the chain of misjudgments, 
that had led to tragedy nearly 50 years earlier. </p> 

<p>Tuchman was also a keen observer of contemporary political life. Shortly after 
Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic senatorial
nomination in New York, Tuchman joined "a Democrats for Keating Committee", along 
with  <a href="jbaldwin.htm">James Baldwin</a>, Richard Hofstadter, 
Joseph Mankiewicz, Paul Newman and other 
prominent liberals.  In the 1968 Presidential race, Tuchman supported 
Eugene McCarthy, who casted her in his presidential cabinet as 
secretary of state, because a historian would give better advice 
that lawyers. In the late 1960s, Tuchman and her friend 
Henry Steele Commanger were 
active in the National Committee for an Effective Congress. She 
did not like President Richard Nixon, as the revelations of the Watergate scandal began to accumulate, 
she first called for his voluntary resignation, but then supported 
Commanger's position, that Nixon should be dismissed from his 
office; it was up to Congress not to set "a precedent of 
acquiescence" that could destroy the political system. 
Immediately after the Six-Day War, Tuchman visited Israel for the second time. 
Her experiences and impressions she later collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Practicing History</span>  
(1981). Tuchman summarized in 'Israel's Swift Sword', 

an article written for <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> (September 1967), 
that "essentially the war was a conflict of societies."</p>



<p>Tuchman's second Pulitzer Prize came from the biography of U.S. 
General Joseph Stilwell (1971), in which she explored the United States' 
relationship with 20th-century China as epitomized in the wartime experiences 
of General Stilwell. With regard to U.S. foreign policy in China it questions 
"how could America act so confidently when it knew it was wrong?" 
</p>
<p>Among her other works are <span style="font-style: italic;">A Distant Mirror</span> (1978), which presented a 
vivid picture of the life in 14th-century France, paralleling its natural 
and man-made disasters to our own century. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The March of Folly </span>(1984) 
Tuchman examined four conflicts and turning points in history: The Trojan 
War, The Protestant Secession, The American Revolution and The American 
War in Vietnam. "Character is fate," is one of Tuchman central 
themes &#8211; of course the Trojans suspected that the famous horse was full 
of Greeks or a cunning threat, but they did what their enemies wanted 
them to do. The Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon  and men who 
surrounded were competent and did not lose the Vietnam War through 
ignorance, which is for Tuchman another example how fatally flawed 
is the psychology of a governing class. "The power to command 
frequently causes failure to think," concludes the author who 
sees that folly is a child of power. Later, in her essay 'Learning 
from History,' she stated that  young people opposed to war shouldn't 
to turn their backs on military service and other Vietnams can be 
prevented only by the presence of the college-educated in the Army. 
</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">The First Salute</span> (1988) Tuchman analyzed the American Revolution. 
She placed the war in the historical context of centuries-long conflicts 
between England and both France and Holland, and painted a vivid portrait 
of General George Washington. The title of the book refers to a salute of 
gunfire on November 16, 1776, when St. Eustatius, a small island in the West 
Indies, acknowledged a ship flying the flag the red-and-white flag of the 
Continental Congress, recognizing American sovereignty. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Practicing History</span> was a collection of essays, in which Tuchman presented the historian 
as a storyteller, who discovers a thesis only after the material is thoroughly 
studied and understood. Historians must know when to stop research and start 
writing it. ''It is laborious, slow, often painful, sometimes agony. 
It means rearrangement, revision, adding, cutting, rewriting. But it 
brings a sense of excitement, almost of rapture; a moment on Olympus. 
In short, it is an act of creation.'' </p>
