<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American mystery writer, one of the modern
masters of the genre. Ellin won three Edgar Allan Poe Awards and the
Mystery Writers of America's prestigious Grand Master Award for
lifetime achievement. Despite his critical acclaim as a novelist, Ellin
is best-known for his short stories, beginning with the 'The Specialty
of the House'
(1948). The story about a New York restaurant with a special treat for
gourmets, was an immediate sensation. It was later dramatized on the
television series <a href="hitch.htm">'Alfred Hitchcock</a>
Presents' as many other Ellin's tales. Often Ellin's short stories deal
with ethical problems, as in the 'Question'. The narrator is an
executioner or 'electrocutioner,' as he likes to be called, and takes a
pride in what he is doing for the state. </p>
<blockquote><font color="White">-<b>-</b></font><b><font size="2">"Well,
you ought to make up your mind one way or the other,' I told him. 'I'd
hate to think you were like every other hypocrite around who says it's
all right to condemn a man to the electric chair and all wrong to pull
the switch.' </font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">'Do I have to be to one to pull it?' he said. 'Do you?' </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'The Question', in <i>The Blessington Method and Other Strange Tales</i>, 1965) </font></blockquote>
<p>Stanley Ellin was born in Brooklyn, New York, where he grew up and lived most of his life. In his childhood his father read 
him Beatrix Potter's tale <i>Peter Rabbit </i>on
his demand over and over again. On the family bookshelves he discovered
the works of Mark Twain, Kipling, Poe, Stevenson, and Maupassant. After
studies at Brooklyn College, Ellin received his B.A. in 1936. Next year
he married Jeanne Michael, an editor; they had one daughter. To support
his family, Ellin abandoned his literary ambitions for a period and
worked as a dairy farmer, "pusher" for a newspaper distributor,
teacher, and steelworker. From 1944 to 1945 he served in the United
States Army. In 1946, encouraged by his wife, Ellin became a full-time
writer. 'The Specialty of the House' won the Best First Story Award in
the <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</i>
contest of 1948. In the story Laffler, a gourmet, goes with his
assistant for a dinner at a exclusive restaurant. The kitchen is what
Laffler wants to see &#127;&#8211; which is a great mistake. </p>
<p> Ellin received Edgar Allan Poe Award in 1954 from the Mystery
Writers of America for the short story 'The House Party', a suburban
story with an element of fantasy. Two years later he was awarded for
the short story 'The Blessington Method', a comment on the social
rights of the elderly, and in 1958 for novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Eight Circle</span>,
which was an attempt at a long, serious novel about a modern private
detective, a man-about-Manhattan, who drives a Cadillac. The title was
derived from Dante's <i>Inferno</i>, in which a circle of dark-colored
stone is divided into ten individual pockets of punishment. Dante sees
there barrators, sowers of discord, counterfeiters, misusers of public
funds, and simoniac popes. When Kirk enters the eight circle, there is
a surprise waiting for him and his client. However, Ellin left the
protagonist, Murray Kirk, and concentrated on short stories. <br>
</p>
      <p>Ellin's exploration of macho self-hatred and violence, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirror, Mirror on the Wall</span>,  won in 1975 Le Grand Prix de Littérature Policière<i>. </i>H.R.F.
Keating selected it in 1987 for his list of the one hundred best crime
novels. The murder mystery revolves round the hero's sexual background.<font size="2"> </font>"Ellin
uses all the words, the words that are likely to offend and are
generally labelled 'dirty', but held in place as they are in the web of
the whole they are no longer 'dirty'. They are no longer words used for
their titillating or shocking effect, as in so many cheaper crime
novels, and cheaper novels of all sorts."<font size="2"> (Keating in <i>Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</i>, 1987)</font></p>

<p>Ellin made his debut as a novelist with <span style="font-style: italic;">Dreadful Summit</span>
(1948). It dealt with father-son relationship, when a sixteen-year-old
boy obtains a gun and sets out to avenge his father's beating and
humiliation. The action is squeezed into twenty-four hours. Following
the tradition of John O'Hara, many of Ellin's stories have a surprise
ending or a twist in the plot, which have made them attractive to film
makers. Clive Donner's film <i>Nothing but the Best</i> (1964) was based on Ellin's  black comedy  'The Best of Everything' (<i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</i>,
November 1952). Alan Bates is an ambitious clerk, Jimmy Brewster, who
marries his boss's daughter (Ann Horton), and kills his former helper
(Denholm Elliot) on his way to the top. <br>
</p>
      <p>In Joseph Losey's film <i>Big Night</i>, made from Ellin's <i>Dreadful Summit</i>
(1951), the author served as a front for two blacklisted writers, Hugo
Butler and Ring Lardner Jr. Losey barely finished this film noir
melodrama before he left Hollywood. The third wave of Hollywood HUAC
hearings had began in 1951, and Losey had been named by two people. His
lawyer invited him to testify secretly. "I simply said 'I'll have to
think it over', and in three days I was on my way to Europe." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Joseph Losey</font></i><font size="2"> by Colin Gardner, 2004)</font><i> Sunburn</i> (1979), starring Farah Fawcett, was very loosely based on the novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Bind</span> (1970). Again the hero  appears to be a sharp, cold-blooded investigator, but has also his soft, knightly side. </p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Mystery Stories</span> (1956) was
hailed by Julian Symons as "the finest collection of stories in the
crime form published in the past half century." It included such works
as 'The Cat's Paw', 'Broker's Special', and 'The Moment of Decision',
in which a dispute between neighbors leads to a fatal decision. <br>
</p>
      <p>In <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> TV series (1955-1965) one of the episodes from 1956, 'Help Wanted', was adapted from Ellin's original 
story.  During the years also 'The Specialty of the House', 'The Blessington Method' and <font size="2"><font size="2"> </font></font>'The
Orderly World of Mr. Appleby', about an antique dealer, who do not want
to sell his precious items, were seen in the series. Broadcast first on
CBS, the programmes opened with a line drawing of Hitchcock's profile,
accompanied by the theme tune, Charles Gounod's <i>Funeral March of the Marionette</i>.
Hitchcock's introductions were written by Jimmy Allardice. 'The Moment
of Decision' was adapted to s sixty-minute television show on <i>The U.S. Steel Hour</i>
(1961). Fred Astaire, famous for his singing and dancing roles, was the
host and played the narrator of the story, the brother-in-law of Hugh
Lozier, "the exception to the rule that people who are completely sure
of themselves cannot be likable." </p>


<p>Ellin's Edgar-winning short story 'The Blessington Method' gave the title for the second book. After his third collection, <span style="font-style: italic;">Kindly Dig Your Grave</span>
(1975), Ellin published in 1979 his complete mystery tales 1948-1978.
Ellin's last story was 'Unacceptable Procedures' (1985), which
questioned the morals of economic development. Ellin died of a heart
attack on July 31, 1986 in Brooklyn. Ellin was a member of Mystery
Writers of America and its past president. His works were a long time
out of print, until Foul Play Press reprinted two of his novels in
1996. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Luxemburg Run</span> (1977) told of identity changes of David Shaw, a young American  man in Europe. 
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Stronghold</span> (1975) Ellin explored his own religious background and portrayed a family of nonviolent Quakers 
at the mercy of single-minded, murderous criminals. The story is 
narrated from the point of view of Marcus Hayworth, a leading member of a Quaker community in upstate New York, 
and the psychotic James Flood, the town's troublemaker in his youth. 

John Milano, Ellin's third PI character was introduced in <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Light, Star Bright</span> (1979), in which Milano tried to prevent the murder of a 
renowned mystic guru, who begins to receive threatening letters.</p>

<p>The second John Milano book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dark Fantastic</span>
(1983), was rejected by Random House because of its insufficient
political correctness in dealing with racial problems and attitudes in
New York. For most of the readers it was clear, that the author did not
share the racist, hate-filled opinions of his character, Professor
Charles Witter Kirwan, who plans to blow up his one of his own
apartment buildings. Kirwan and Milano alternately narrate the story. <br>
</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">House of Cards</span> (1963)
was a a Hitchcockian psychological thriller with international
intrigue. "Ellin is not just a chessboard plotter, he is a plotter on
the move, one of the greatest scenery-shifters since Helen MacInnes &#8211;
an almost cinematic director of rhythms," wrote Melvin Maddosks in his
review in<i> Life</i> <font size="2">(10 February, 1967)</font>. The
film version of the book, starring George Peppard and Inger Stevens,
was made in 1969. George Peppard played Reno Davis, a former American
prizefighter, who lives in France. He has been trying to become a
writer but takes a job as tutor of young Paul de Villemont, son of an
aristocratic family. In the barred de Villemont mansion Reno becomes
involved with Paul's beautiful, neurotic mother, Anne de Villemont
(Inger Stevens). A fascist group with connections to the family plans a
coup d'état, and pursues Anne and Reno throughout Europe. Orson Welles,
in one of his most forgettable roles, was a menacing conspirator, named
Leschenhaut. </p>
