<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> Prolific American short-story writer, a
master of surprise endings, whose narratives were typically set in
Texas or New York City. O. Henry combined humor and pathos with an
ironic twist of plot. Although some critics were not so enthusiastic
about his formulatic way of writing, the public loved his entertaining
tales and uncomplicated characters.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He wrote love stories, a thing I have
always kept free from, holding the belief that the well-known and
popular sentiment is not properly matter for publication, but something
to be privately handled by the alienist and the florist." </b></font><font size="2">(from 'The Plutonian Fire', in <i>The Voice of the City</i>, 1908) </font></blockquote>

<p>O. Henry was born William Sydney Porter in Greenboro, North
Carolina, where he lived nearly half of his life. His father, Algernon
Sidney Porter, was a physician. When William was three, his mother
died, and he was raised by his parental grandmother and paternal aunt.
William was an avid reader, but at the age of fifteen he left school,
and then worked in a drug store and on a Texas ranch. He continued to
Houston, where he had a number of jobs, including that of bank clerk.
After moving in 1882 to Texas, he worked on a ranch in LaSalle County
for two years. In 1887 he married Athol Estes Roach; they had one
daughter and one son. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are."</b> (from 'The Octopus Marooned', in<i> The Gentle Grafter</i>, 1908) </font></blockquote>

<p>In 1894 Porter started a humorous weekly <i>The Rolling Stone</i>. It was at this time that he began  heavy drinking. When 
the weekly failed, he joined the <i>Houston Post</i>
as a reporter and columnist. In 1894 cash was found to have gone
missing from the First National Bank in Austin, where Porter had worked
as a bank teller. When he was called back to Austin to stand trial,
Porter fled to Honduras to avoid trial. Little is known about Porter's
stay in Central America. It is said, that he met one Al Jennings, and
rambled in South America and Mexico on the proceeds of Jenning's
robbery. After hearing news that his wife was dying, he returned in
1897 to Austin. In 1897 he was convicted of embezzling money, although
there has been much debate over his actual guilt. Porter entered in
1898 a penitentiary at Columbus, Ohio. </p>
<p>While in prison, Porter started to write short stories to earn money
to support his daughter Margaret. His first work, 'Whistling Dick's
Christmas Stocking' (1899), appeared in <i>McClure's Magazine</i>. The
stories of adventure in the U.S. Southwest and in Central America
gained an immediately success among readers. After doing three years of
the five years sentence, Porter emerged from the prison in 1901 and
changed his name to O. Henry to hide his past. Throughout his whole
career he gave only few interviews. According to some sources, he
acquired the pseudonym from a warder called Orrin Henry. It also could
be an abbreviation of the name of a French pharmacist, Eteinne-Ossian
Henry, found in the U.S. Dispensatory, a reference work Porter used
when he was in the prison pharmacy. The art of storytelling he learned
from his reading of Harte, Kipling, and Maupassant, but his humorous,
energetic style also shows the influence of Mark Twain and Ambrose
Bierce. </p>


<p>O. Henry moved to New York City in 1902. From December 1903 to January 1906 he wrote a story a week for the New York <i>World</i>, also publishing  in such magazines as <i>Everybody's Magazine</i>, <i>Munsey's</i>, <i>McClure's</i>, and others. O. Henry's first collections, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cabbages and Kings</span> (1904) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Four Million&nbsp;</span>
(1906), made him a household name. The latter included 'The Gift of the
Magi', about a poor couple and their Christmas gifts, and 'The
Furnished Room'. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Trimmed Lamp</span>
(1907) explored the lives of New Yorkers; the city itself O. Henry
liked to call "Bagdad-on the-Subway". In 'The Last Leaf', a sentimental
piece about two women artists and their failed artist friend, the theme
is selfishness, as in 'The Gift of the Magi', but there is also a
lesbian undercurrent, which separates it from O. Henry's
run-of-the-mill works. </p>
<p>'One Dollar's Worth' criticized the merciless judicial system. Judge
Derwent receives a letter from an ex-convict, in which the writer,
'Rattlesnake' threatens his daughter and the district attorney,
Littlefield. A young Mexican, Rafael Ortiz, is accused of passing a
counterfeit silver dollar, made principally of lead. Rafael's girl,
Joya Treviñas, tells Littlefield that he is innocent &#8211; she was sick,
and needed medicine, and that was the reason why Rafael used the
dollar. Littlefield refuses to help, and Joya says that "it the life of
the girl you love is ever in danger, remember Rafael Ortiz." When he
drives out of the town with Nancy Derwent, they meet Mexico Sam, the
writer of the letter. He starts to shoot them from distance with his
rifle. Littlefield can't hurt him with his own gun which has only tiny
pellets. Then he remembers Joya's words, and manages hit Mexico Sam,
who falls from his horse dead as a rattlesnake. Next morning in the
court he tells:<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"'I shot him,' said the
district attorney, 'with Exhibit A of your counterfeiting case. Lucky
thing for me &#8211; and somebody else &#8211; that it was as bad money as it was!
It sliced up into slugs very nicely. Say, Kil, can't you go down to the
jacals and find where that Mexican girl lives? Miss Derwent wants to
know.'" </p>
<p>O. Henry's most anthologized work is perhaps 'The Ransom 
of Red Chief' (see <a href="hhawks.htm">Howard Hawks</a> and  <a href="nunnally.htm">Nunnally Johnson</a>),  first collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Whirligigs</span>
(1910). The story tells about two kidnappers, who make off with the
young son of a prominent man. They find out that the child is a real
nuisance &#8211; <i>Home Alone</i> movies owe a debt to the story. At the end they agree to pay the boy's father to take him back. <b>&#8211; </b>"Sam,"
says Bill, "I suppose you'll think I'm a renegade. but I couldn't help
it. I'm a grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of
self-defense, but there is a time when all systems of egotism and
predominance fail. The boy is gone. I sent him home. All is off. There
was martyrs in old times," goes on Bill, "that suffered death rather
than give up the particular graft they enjoyed. None of 'em ever was
subjugated to such supernatural tortures as I have been. I tried to be
faithful to our articles of depredation; but there came a limit." </p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Heart of the West</span> (1907)
presented western stories, of which 'The Last of the Troubadours' J.
Frank Dobie named "the best range story in American fiction." 'The
Caballero's Way' featured as a character the Cisco Kid. During his life
time, O. Henry published 10 collections and over 600 short stories. His
last years were shadowed by alcoholism, ill health, and financial
problems. He was a fast writer, like the Russian Anton Checkhov
(1860-1904), but drinking on average two quarts of whiskey daily, did
not improve the quality of his work. Usually he went to his regular bar
at about 10 o'clock. </p>
<p>In 1907 O. Henry married Sara Lindsay Coleman, his childhood friend
born in Greensboro. The marriage was not happy, and they separated a
year later. O. Henry died of cirrhosis of the liver on June 5, 1910, in
New York. At the time of his death, he was deeply in dept. O. Henry's
funeral ceremony at the Little Church Around the Corner was brief.
Three more collections, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sixes and Sevens </span>(1911), <span style="font-style: italic;">Rolling Stones</span> (1912) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Waifs and Strays </span>(1917),
came out posthumously.
In 1918 the O. Henry Memorial Awards were established to be given
annually to the best magazine stories, the winners and leading
contenders to be published in an annual volume. </p>
