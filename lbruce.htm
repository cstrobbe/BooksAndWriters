<p>American stand-up comedian and brilliant satirist, who created much
controversy in his time due to his use of so-called '"dirty words" in
his nightclub comedy act. The black humor of Bruce's largely improvised
shows often overstepped the bounds of what was considered in the 1950s
and 1960s respectable. Bruce's performances, his fresh and daring way
of breaking rules, influenced such comedians as George Carlin, Richard
Pryor, and Robin Williams. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Children ought to watch pornographic movies : it's healthier than learning about sex from Hollywood.</b></font><b><font size="2">" </font></b><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">How to Talk Dirty and Influence People</font></i><font size="2">, 1965) </font></blockquote>

<p>Leonard Alfred Schneider (Lenny Bruce) was born in New York, the son of Mickey (Myron) Schneider, a podiatrist<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;and
Sally Marr (née Kitchenberg),&nbsp;a stage performer. "To me, if you
live in New York or any other big city, you are Jewish, he once said. "
It doesn't matter even if you're Catholic; if you live in New York
you're Jewish. If you live in Butte, Montana, you are going to be
goyish if you're Jewish." Bruce's&nbsp;mother had tricked his
father&nbsp;into marrying her by pretending to be pregnant. They
divorced when Bruce was five and he was brought up by relatives. </p><p>During
World War II&nbsp;Bruce served in the Navy on the U. S. S. Brooklyn, a
light cruiser. He&nbsp;saw action in Anzio, Salerno, Sicily, and the
Southern France&nbsp;and was discharged from the Navy for wearing
women's clothing. After spending some time in odd jobs, he&nbsp;went
to&nbsp;California&nbsp;to study acting. Because "Leonard Alfred
Schneider sounded too Hollywood",&nbsp;he changed his name in 1947 to
Bruce. To pursue his career closer at home, Bruce moved back to New
York. At Hanson's, a hang-out for comics, he&nbsp;met Joe Ancis, famous
for his very "sick" comic. Under his influence Bruce began to
incorporate taboo subjects into his routines. </p><p>The fifties was the breakthrough decade for Bruce and such
comedians as Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Mort Sahl, who were all Jewish,
with their own vision of ethnicity. Their humor evoked a response among
young Bohemians and college-educated people. However, though Bruce's
monologues were flavoured with Yiddishisms, his unleashed, manic style
and raw courage did not draw from the traditions of Yiddish humor,
characterized by subtlety, self-mockery, and wryness. He had more in
common with Jazz musicians: "Dig: I'm Jewish. Count Basie's Jewish. Ray
Charles is Jewish." <font size="2">(from <em>The Essential Lenny Bruce</em>, 1970) &nbsp;</font></p><p>Bruce
worked as a night-club performer in Brooklyn and Baltimore, where he
met a striptease dancer, known as Hot Honey Harlowe. Born Harriett
Jolliff in 1927,&nbsp;she&nbsp;had ran away from home in her teens.
At&nbsp;some point of her life she had been sentenced to jail. "Honey
and I just stared at each other and got hot," Bruce later said. They
married in 1951 and had one daughter.&nbsp;On Bruce's insistence, Honey
had several abortions, and the marriage ended in divorce&nbsp;in 1957.
Honey, who later published a book of memoir, <i>Honey: The Life and Loves of Lenny's Shady Lady</i> (1976), died in 2005 in Honolulu. She was cast&nbsp;in two films, <i>Dance Hall Racket</i> (1953), written by Lenny Bruce and directed by Phil Tucker, and&nbsp;<i>Princess of the Nile</i> (1954), starring Debra Paget, Jeffrey Hunter and Michael Rennie.</p>
<p>Bruce appeared on the Arthur Godfrey Show and drew national
attention with his daring style of satire, in which he probed taboo
subjects such as racial fears, sexual fantasies, Jewish-Christian
tensions, and presidents. "I really dig what they do with a homosexual
in this country. They put him into a prison with a lot of other men.
That's a really good punishment."<font size="2"> (Dustin Hoffman in </font><i><font size="2">Lenny</font></i><font size="2">)</font></p>
<p>Bruce imagined Hitler in show business and stewardesses jettisoning
infants from overloaded airliners, betraying at the same time a
schooling in the Catskills resorts. The black sheep among young comics,
such as Joe E. Lewis, Buddy Hackett, Alan King, Bruce played to
intellectuals. His wit and inimitable frankness made his act celebrated
in liberal literary circles, with some notable exeptions, such as Jack
Kerouac who said, "I hate him! He hates everything, he hates life!" </p>

<p>In Hollywood Bruce worked at night-clubs and on a local television
show. The 20th Century Fox&nbsp;assigned him to strenghten comic
sequences of <em>The Rocket Man</em> (1954), starring Charles Coburn,
Spring Byington and Anne Francis, who said in an interview: "I was most
fond of Lenny. He was a real pussycat, and wanted me to go out with
him. I told him I would be terrified to do so, and that was that!" From
1953 to 1956 Bruce worked Southern California's strip-joint circuit.
Once he&nbsp;entered the stage wearing nothing but back socks and
shoes. </p>
<p>Bruce's&nbsp;divorce from Honey was followed by<strong> </strong>a
burst of creativity and legal battles.&nbsp;Steve Allen had Bruce on
his show in April 1959. While in New York City, he appeared at the Den
in the Duane, a small club on Madison Avenue, where Dick Cavett and
Milt Kamen did comedy, too. In 1961 Bruce was imprisoned on obscenity
charges.&nbsp;After Peter Cook had&nbsp;opened The Establishment Club
in Soho, London, he performed there in 1962,&nbsp;but in the next
year&nbsp;he was refused permission to enter Britain. "The comic, Lenny
Bruce, was booed offstage in England," claimed the controversial radio
journalist Walter Winchell. Eventually Bruce's show was banned both in
England and Australia. </p><p>When
a number of nightclub owners refused to take Bruce's show, assuming
that it would only lead to police arrest, he was unable to perform his
material. In 1962 the United States District Court in San Francisco, in
support of a bankruptcy action, declared him a pauper. In spite of
pressures, Bruce refused to clean up his language. "All my humour is
based on destruction and despair," he said. "If the whole world were
tranquil, I'd be standing in the breadline, right back of J. Edgar
Hoover." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Essential Lenny Bruce</font></i><font size="2">, 1970) </font>In 1964 Bruce was convicted of giving obscene performances at the Cafe au Go Go in Greenwich Village. </p><p>The idea for Bruce's autobiography, <em>How to Talk Dirty and Influence People</em>, was suggested by Hugh Hefner in 1963. It&nbsp;was published&nbsp;in <i>Playboy</i>
over the next two years and in book form in 1965.&nbsp; When&nbsp;Bruce
was arrested by the police in April 1964, Norman Mailer, James Jones,
&nbsp;James Baldwin, Henry Miller, and other prominent writers and
intellectuals defended him as a social satirist "in the tradition of
Swift, Rabelais and Twain."&nbsp;Bruce himself thought that the
petition was ridiculous. During his later years Bruce&nbsp;was addicted
to heroin. In 1963 he was found guilty of illegal possession of drugs.
Lenny Bruce died of an overdose on August 3, 1966, in his home on
Hollywood Boulevard. He was 40 years old. </p>
<p>Bruce's life inspired Julian Barry's 1971 play <i>Lenny </i>and Bob Fosse's film <i>Lenny</i>
(1974), which portrayed him as a martyr of freedom of speech. Marvin
Worth, Bruce's longtime friend, had tried to produce a screen biography
of him since 1968. Fosse considered Dustin Hoffman the best candidate
for the title role&nbsp;&#8211; the actor even looked like Lenny. Actress
Valerie Perrine, who played his wife, Honey, had been a Las Vegas
stripper. In the nightclub scenes Hoffman performed many of Bruce's
most remembered monologues, with a live audience looking on. "I'm
totally corrupted. I mean, really. My whole act, my whole economic
success, whatever that is, is based solely on the existence of
segregation, violence, despair, disease and injustice. And if by some
miracle, the whole world would suddenly tranquilize, be pured, I would
be standing in an unemployment line somewhere. So you see, I'm not a
moralist."<font size="2"> (Dustin Hoffman in Lenny) </font></p>
<p>Hoffman had prepared himself well for the role&nbsp;&#8211; he listened to
records, watched films, and read books on the comedian. He also had his
own view of the Lenny myth: "I don't believe Lenny used drugs just to
get wasted. Instead, I thought he used them to keep himself going for
four days, since he was under enormous pressure from performing in
clubs, writing new material, recording new record albums, and planning
concerts."<font size="2"> (in <i>Dustin Hoffman, Hollywood's Antihero</i> by Jeff Lenburg, 1983) </font></p>

<p>Lenny Bruce expanded dramatically the style and subject matter of
stand-up-comedy. His style has left impact on many performers. Years
later Eddie Murphy was using language and material that would have made
Bruce seem inhibited. Woody Allen, who had became a respected comedy
writer in the late 1950s, appealed to a similar audience, but when
Bruce satirized middle-class values, Allen satirized his own
idiosyncrasies. </p>



<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time. </font><br>
<font size="2">I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half, </font><br>
<font size="2">Seemed like it took a couple of months. </font><br>
<font size="2">Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
