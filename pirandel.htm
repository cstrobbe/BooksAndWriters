<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Italian author, who was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1934 for his "bold and brilliant renovation of
the drama and the stage." Pirandello's works include novels, hundreds
of short stories, and c. 40 plays, some of which are written in
Sicilian dialect. Typical for Pirandello is to show how art or illusion
mixes with reality and how people see things in very different way <font face="Symbol">-</font>
words are unrealiable and reality is at the same time true and false.
Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners for theatre of
the absurd. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A man will die, a writer, the instrument
of creation: but what he has created will never die! And to be able to
to live for ever you don't need to have extraordinary gifts or be able
to do miracles. Who was Sancho Panza? Who was Prospero? But they will
live for ever because &#8211; living seeds &#8211; they had the luck to find a
fruitful soil, an imagination which knew how to grow them and feed
them, so that they will live for ever."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Six Characters in Search of an Author</font></i><font size="2">, 1921) </font></blockquote>


<p>Luigi Pirandello was born in Caos, near Girgenti, on the island of
Sicily, which was to be the inspiration of his writings. "I am a child
of Chaos and not only allegorically," he said in his biographical
sketch; his family spent vacations at a house called Chaos.
Pirandello's father, Stefano Ricci-Gramitto, who had fought with
Garibaldi, owned a prosperous sulfur mine. </p>
<p>His childhood Pirandello spent in modest weath in Girgenti (today
called Agrigento) and Palermo, surrounded by nurses and servants, and
enjoying the adoration of his mother. From his teens Pirandello showed
literary talents, but he first studied law. His father intended his son
to become a businessman. In 1887 Pirandello entered the University of
Rome, from where he was expelled for offending a Latin professor, and
then transferred to the University of Bonn, Germany, receiving his
doctoral degree in Roman philology in 1891. Pirandello's dissertation,
written in Germany, dealt with the dialect of his native region. </p>
<p>After having a liaison with his cousin Linuccia, which his father
did not approve, Pirandello started his career as a writer. "Blessed is
he who can stop halfway and before old age comes on can marry illusion
and preserve it lovingly," Pirandello wrote in 1887 in a letter of his
future plans. In Rome, where he had settled with a montly allowance
from his father, Pirandello translated Goethe's <i>Roman Elegies</i>, wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">Elegie Renane</span> (1895), and published two collections of poetry, and a collection of short stories, <span style="font-style: italic;">Amori senza amore</span> (1894). In 1898 he became a professor of Italian literature at a teacher's college for women, and  worked there for 24 years. <span style="font-style: italic;">L'esclusa</span>
(1901) was Pirandello's first full-length novel. In the ironical story
the protagonist suspects that his wife is unfaithful and takes her back
after the adultery has actually occurred. </p>
<p>Pirandello had married in 1894 Antonietta Portulano, a fellow
Sicilian and the daughter of his father's business associate. She
suffered mental breakdown in 1904. When her condition steadily worsened
<font face="Symbol">-</font> she became insane with a jealous paranoia <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the illness deeply influenced Pirandello's writing. During World War I,
both of Pirandello's sons were captured as prisoners of war. After his
wife's illness got worse, Pirandello was forced to place her in 1919 in
a mental institution. </p>
<p>When the collapse of the sulfur mines destroyed the family business,
Pirandello had to turn his writing into a financially profitable
activity. In 1904 Pirandello gained his first literary success with the
novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> Il fu Mattia Pascal</span>. Its
antihero, Mattia Pascal, is mistakenly declared dead. Offered an
opportunity to start life over again, he escapes from his family. In
Monte Carlo Mattia wins a fortune, but his newly found freedom turns
sour and he must return to his hometown, to his past he had hoped to
leave behind. "I can't really say that I'm myself," he thinks. "I don't
know who I am. . . . I am the late Mattia Pascal." In the following
decades the questions "who am I?" and "what is real?" became central in
Pirandello's fiction. <span style="font-style: italic;">Uno, nessuno e centomila</span>
(1925-26, One, None, and Hundred-Thousand), a story about husband's
descend into madness, owed more to Freud than Gogol. His despair starts
when his wife comments a slight defect on his nose <font face="Symbol">-</font> it tilts to the right. </p>
<p>Pirandello started to write plays as early as in the 1880s, but he
first considered the stage insensitive medium compared to the novel.
After 1915, Pirandello concentrated on the theater and wrote until 1921
sixteen dramas. <span style="font-style: italic;">La ragione degli altri</span>
(1915) was Pirandello's first three-act play. It did not gain much
understanding, but through the performances of the actor Angelo Musco
(1892-1937) his work started to attract attention. His ideal female
lead Pirandello found in Marta Abba, for whom he wrote several plays,
among them <span style="font-style: italic;">Diana e la Tuda</span>&nbsp; (1926, Diana and Tuda), <span style="font-style: italic;">L'amica delle mogli</span>&nbsp; (1927, The Wives's Friend), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Come tu mi vuoi</span>
(1930, As You Desire Me). Pirandello also engaged her for his own
company, the Teatro d'Arte di Roma, and formed a relationship with her,
documented in <i>Pirandello's Love Letters to Martha Abba </i>(1994). </p>
<p>Cosi è (se vi pare) (Right You Are - If You Think You
Are), published in 1918, marked Pirandello's interest in the
examination of the relativity of truth. The story was about a woman
whose identity remains hidden and who could be one of the two very
different people. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore</span>&nbsp;
(1921, Six Chracters in Search
of An Author) asked the question, can fictional characters be more
authentic than real persons, and what is the relationship between
imaginary characters and the writer, who has created them. </p>
<p><i>Six Characters in Search of an Author</i><b> </b>consists of
roles-within-roles. In rehearsal preparations of a theatrical company
are interrupted by the Father and his family who explain that they are
characters from an unfinished dramatic works. They want to interpret
again crucial moments of their lives, claiming that they are "truer"
than the "real" characters. "How can we understand each other if the
words I use have the sense and the value I expect them to have, but
whoever is listening to me inevitably thinks that those same words have
a different sense and value, because of the private world he has inside
himself too. We think we understand each other: but we never do," says
the Father. He tells that he has helped his wife to start a new life
with her lover and the three illegitimate children born to them. The
Wife claims that he forced her into the arms of another man. The
Stepdaughter accuses the Father for her shame &#8211; they met before in Mme
Pace's infamous house, and he did not recognize her. She was forced to
turn to prostitution to support the family. The Son refuses to
acknowledge his family and runs into the garden. He shots himself and
the actors argue about whether the boy is dead or not. The Father
insists that the events are real. The Producer says: "Make-believe?!
Reality?! Oh, go to hell the lot of you! Lights! Lights! Lights!" and
The Stepdaughter escapes into the audience laughing maniacally.</p>
<p><i>Six Chracters in Search
of An Author</i> created a scandal when
it was first performed in Rome, but it was hailed as a masterpiece in
Paris, innovatively produced by Georges Pitoëff. G.B. Shaw praised it
as the most original play ever.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Enrio IV</span>
(1922, Henry IV, known in the United States as The Living Mask),
premiered in Milan, received much better reception. The play told about
a man who has fallen from his horse during a masquerade and starts to
believe he is the German emperor Henry IV. To accommodate his illness
his wealthy sister has placed him in a medieval castle surrounded by
actors dressed as eleventh-century courtiers. The nameless hero regains
his sanity after twelve years, but decides to pretend he is mad. </p>
<p>With the trilogy  <i>Six Characters in Search
of An Author</i>, in which the characters of the title are called into existence by a writer,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ciascuno&nbsp; suo modo</span> (1924) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Questa sera si recita soggetto</span> (1930), Pirandello revolutionized the modern theatrical techniques. A second trilogy, <span style="font-style: italic;">La nuova colonia</span> (1928),<span style="font-style: italic;"> Lazzarro</span> (1929), and <span style="font-style: italic;">I giganti della montagna</span> (1934, The Mountain Giants) moved from the limits of truth-telling to the reality outside of art. <i>The Mountain Giants </i>was
left unfinished. It portrayed a magician, who lives in an abandoned
villa. A theatrical company decides to perform at a celebration given
by the 'Giants of the Mountain.' The barbaric audience tears two of the
actors to pieces and kills one of the directors of the company. </p>
<p> Pirandello once said: "I hate symbolic art in which the
presentation loses all spontaneous movement in order to become a
machine, an allegory <font face="Symbol">-</font> a vain and
misconceived effort because the very fact of giving an allegorical
sense to a presentation clearly shows that we have to do with a fable
which by itself has no truth either fantastic or direct; it was made
for the demonstration of some moral truth."<font size="2"> (from <i>Playwrights on Playwriting</i>, ed. by Toby Cole, 1961) </font>Pirandello's central themes, the problem of identity, the ambiguity of truth and reality, has been compared to explorations of <a href="ibsen.htm">Henrik Ibsen </a>and <a href="strindbe.htm">August Strindberg</a>,
but he also anticipated Beckett and Ionesco. One of the earliest
formulations of his relativist position Pirandello presented in the
essay 'Art and Consciousness Today' (1893), in which he argued that the
old norms have crumbled and the idea of relativity deprives "almost
altogether of the faculty for judgment." A central concepts in his work
is "naked mask," referring our social roles and on the stage the
dialectic relationship between the actor and the character portrayed. In<i> Six Characters</i>
the father points out, that a fictional figure has a permanence that
comes from an unchanging text, but a real-life person may well be "a
nobody." Pirandello did not only restrict his ideas to theatre acting,
but noted in his novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> Si gira</span> (1915), that the film actor "feels as if in exile <font face="Symbol">-</font> exiled not only from the stage, but also from himself."</p>
<p>In 1923 Pirandello requested membership in the Fascist party and
obtained Mussolini's support in founding the National Art Theatre of
Rome (Teatro d'Arte di Roma). However, the company was closed in 1928
on grounds of financial problems. In 1934 Pirandello's libretto for
Gian Francesco Malipiero's opera <i>The Fable of the Changeling</i>
was criticized by the Fascist authorities. Pirandello had first seen in
Mussolini a man committed to the facts rather than theory, but later he
described Mussolini as "as top hat, and empty top hat that by itself
cannot stand upright." Remaining critical towards the regime, he did
not support the Ethiopian invasion by Italy. Pirandello died in Rome on
December 10, 1936. </p>
<p>Pirandello's influence can be seen  on such European and American writers as <a href="anouilh.htm">Jean Anouilh</a>,<a href="sartre.htm"> Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, <a href="beckett.htm">Samuel Beckett</a>, Eugène Ionesco,  Jean Genet, <a href="oneill.htm">Eugene O'Neill</a>,
and Edward Albee. In Latin America, Jorge Luis Borges's questioning of
the nature of identity have much in common with Pirandellian themes.
Several of Pirandello's works have been adapted to screen, including <i>As You Desire Me</i> (1932), starring Greta Garbo, <i>L'homme de nulle part </i>(1937), based on the novel <i>The Late Mathias Pascal</i> and directed by and Pierre Chenal. <i>Kaos</i>, directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani (1984), was based on the author's four Sicilian stories. </p>
