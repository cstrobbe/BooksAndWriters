<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Scottish essayist, poet, and author of
fiction
and travel books, known especially for his novels of adventure.
Stevenson's characters often prefer unknown hazards to everyday life of
the Victorian society. His most famous examination of the split
personality is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde </span>(1886).
Many of Stevenson's stories are set in colorful locations, they have
also horror and supernatural elements. Arguing against realism,
Stevenson underlined the "nameless longings of the reader", the desire
for experience. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But we are so fond of life that we have
no leisure to entertain the terror of death. It is a honeymoon with us
all through, and none of the longest. Small blame to us if we give our
whole hearts to this glowing bride of ours, to the appetities, to
honour, to the hungry curiosity of the mind, to the pleasure of the
eyes in nature, and the pride of our own nimble bodies."</b> (from 'Aes Triplex')</font></blockquote>

<p>Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson was born in Edinburgh. He was the
only son of Thomas Stevenson, a prosperous joint-engineer to the Board
of Northern Lighthouses, and Margaret Balfour, daughter of a Scottish
clergyman. Thomas Stevenson invented, among others, the marine
dynamometer, which measures the force of waves. Thomas's grandfather
was Britain's greatest builder of lighthouses. </p>
<p>Stevenson was largely raised by his nanny, Alison Cunningham, whom he devoted <span style="font-style: italic;">A Child's Garden of Verses</span>
(1885). Cunningham had strong Calvinist convictions and praying became
part of Stevenson's early life, and later reflected in such pieces like
the poem 'A Thought': "It is very nice to think / The world is full of
meat and drink, / With little children saying grace / In every
Christian kind of place." </p>
 


<p>Since his childhood, Stevenson suffered from tuberculosis. During
his early years, he spent much of his time in bed, composing stories
before he had learned to read. At the age of sixteen, he produced a
short historical tale. As an adult, there were times when Stevenson
could not wear a jacket for fear of bringing on a haemorrhage of the
lung. In 1867, he entered Edinburgh University to study engineering.
Due to his ill health, he had to abandon his plans to follow in his
father's footsteps. Stevenson changed to law and in 1875 he was called
to the Scottish bar. By then he had already started to write travel
sketches, essays, and short stories for magazines. His first articles
were published in <i>The Edinburgh University Magazine </i>(1871) and <i>The Portofolio</i> (1873). </p>
<p>In a attempt to improve his health, Stevenson travelled on the
Continent and in the Scottish Highland. These trips provided him with
many insights and inspiration for his writing, although sometimes could
take a long time before Stevenson edited for publication his notes and
sketches. </p>
<p>Stevenson's tone in his travelogues is often jovial or satirical, but he also had a sharp eye for social detail.
However, constant voyaging due to his poor health was not always easy for him. In a letter,
written on his journey across the Atlantic in 1879, he complained: "I
have a strange, rather horrible, sense of the sea before me, and can
see no further into future. I can say honestly I have at this moment
neither a regret, a hope, a fear or an inclination; except a mild one
for a bottle of good wine which I resist". <span style="font-style: italic;">The Amateur Emigrant</span>,
an account of this voyage, was not published until 1895. Stevenson
bought a second class ticket, which&nbsp; helped him to observe the
distinction between first-class passengers and others on board. Much of
his time Stevenson spent with the steerage passengers. He was surprised
how the mere presence of first class persons could have a freezing
effect below the decks. "They seemed to throw their clothes in our
faces. Their eyes searched us all over for tatters and incongruities. A
laugh was ready at their lips; but they were too well-mannered to
indulge it in our hearing. Wait a bit, till they were all back in the
saloon, and then hear how wittily they would depict the manners of the
steerage." <br>
 </p>

<p>Stevenson's own early favorite books, which influenced his imagination and thinking, included Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, Dumas's adventure tale of the elderly D'Artagan, <i>Vicomte de Bragelone</i>,  and Walt Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,
"a book which tumbled the world upside down for me, blew into space a
thousand cobwebs of genteel and ethical illusion, and having thus
shaken my tabernacle of lies, set me back again upon a strong
foundation of all the original and manly virtues."<font size="2"> (from <i>Reading in Bed</i>, ed. by Steven Gilbar, 1995) </font>Also Montaigne's<i> Essais</i> and the Gospel according to St. Matthew were very important for him. <font size="2"></font> </p>
 
<p>An account of Stevenson's canoe tour of France and Belgium was published in 1878 as <span style="font-style: italic;">An Inland Voyage</span>. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes</span>,
based on his walking trip in France, during which he learned to control
himself as well as his stubborn donkey. "I travel for travel's sake,"
Stevenson wrote. "The great affair is to move." With his friend William
Ernest Henley he wrote several plays. While in France Stevenson met
Fanny Vandegrift Osbourne, a married woman with two children, Belle and
Lloyd. Fanny was 10 years older than Stevenson, who viewed her as an
"exotic goddess". She returned to the United States to get a divorce.
In 1879 Stevenson followed her to California, where they married in
1880. After a brief stay at Calistoga,
which was recorded in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Silverado Squatters&nbsp;</span> (1883), they returned to  Scotland, and then moved often in search of better climates.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Wealth I ask not, hope nor love, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Nor a friend to know me; </font><br>
<font size="2">All I ask, the heaven above </font><br>
<font size="2">And the road below me. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Songs of Travel</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Stevenson gained first fame with the romantic adventure story  <span style="font-style: italic;">Treasure Island</span>, a combination of travel adventure and romance. This work appeared first  serialized  in <i>Young Folks</i>
1881-82. Before its publication in book form Stevenson revised the
text. The central character is Jim Hawkins, whose mother keeps an inn
near the coast in the West Country. Jim meets an old pirate, Billy
Bones, who has in his possession a map showing the location of Captain
Flint's treasure. Bones dies after a second visit of his enemies. Jim,
his mother, and a blind man named Pew, open Bones's sea chest and finds
an oilskin packet containing the map. Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey,
Jim, and a small crew with Captain Smollett sail for Treasure Island.
Jim discovers that the crew of the <i>Hispaniola</i>
includes pirates, led by a personable one-legged man named Long John
Silver, the cook of the ship. On a journey to the island interior, Jim
encounters Ben Gunn, former shipmate of the pirates. After several
adventures the pirates are defeated, Jim befriends with Long John, and
the treasure is found. Jim and his friends sail back to England. Long
John Silver manages to escape, taking as much gold as he can carry. The
famous poem from the novel<i> </i>("Fifteen men on the dead man's chest
/ Yo-ho-ho, and the bottle of rum!/ Drink and the devil had done for
the rest &#8211; Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!) could have originally been
"Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest... referring to a Caribbean Island
Dead Chest. According to a tale, the notorious pirate Edward Teach left
fifteen men on the island of Dead Man's Chest, with a bottle of rum and
a sword. </p>
<p><i>A Child's Garden of Verses  </i>was a success &#8211; its poems have also become popular as songs. Stevenson's other major works from the 1880s are  <span style="font-style: italic;">Kidnapped</span> (1886), the story of David Balfour, his distant ancestor, <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>,  based on a dream and written and printed in 10 weeks, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Black Arrow</span> (1888),  set in the era of the War of the Roses, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Master of Ballantrae</span> (1889). He also contributed to various periodicals, including <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i> and <i> Longman's Magazine</i>,
where his best-known article 'A Humble Remonstrance' was published in
1884. This replay to Henry James's 'The Art of Fiction' launched a
lifelong friendship between the two authors. Stevenson saw that the
novel is a selection of and reorganization of certain aspects of life &#8211;
"life is monstrous, infinite, illogical, abrupt and poignant; a work of
art, in comparison, is neat, finite, self-contained, rational, flowing
and emasculate." </p>
<p><i>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>, published in
January of 1886, sold 40,000 copies in six months in Britain. Stevenson
once said, that its plot was revealed to him in a dream. The mystery
of Jekyll and Hyde is gradually revealed through the narratives of Mr
Enfield, Mr Utterson, Dr Lanyon, and Jekyll's butler Poole. Utterson,
Jekyll's lawyer, discovers that the nasty Mr. Edward Hyde is the heir
of Dr. Jekyll's fortune. Hyde is suspected of a murder. Utterson and
Poole break into Jekyll's laboratory and find the lifeless Hyde. Two
documents explain the mystery: Jekyll's old friend, the late Dr.
Lanyon, tells that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. In his own
account Jekyll tells that to separate the good and evil aspects of his
nature, he invented a transforming drug. His evil self takes the form
of the repulsive Mr Hyde. Jekyll's supplies of drugs run out and he
finds himself slipping involuntarily into being Hyde. Jekyll kills
himself, but the last words of the confession are written by his alter
ego:<b> </b>"Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Dr. Jekyll to an end." </p>
<p>The story has been considered an criticism of Victorian double
morality, but it can be read as a comment on Charles Darwin's book <i>The Origin of Species</i>
&#8211; Dr. Jekyll turns in his experiment the evolution backwards and
reveals the primitive background of a cultured human being. Henry James
admired Stevenson's "genuine feeling for the perpetual moral question,
a fresh sense of the difficulty of being good and the brutishness of
being bad". <font size="2"> ('Robert Louis Stevenson' by Henry James in </font><i><font size="2">Century Magazine</font></i><font size="2"> 35, April 1888)</font>
Modern readers have set the story against Freudian sexual theories and
the split in man's psyche between ego and instinct, although the
"split" takes the form of a physical change, rather than inner
dissociation. And it has been argued, that the conflict between Jekyll
and Hyde reveals era's class phobias. <i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde </i>has
taken a place as an icon of popular culture and adapted among others
into screen over 20 times. The tale of double personality and
metamorphosis appealed strongly to Victorian readers. The novel was
partly based on Stevenson's and W.E. Henley's play <span style="font-style: italic;">Deacon Brodia</span>
(1880), where an Edinburgh councilor is publicly respectable person,
but privately a thief and rakehell. The basic theme of true identity
has inspired such writers as <a href="mshelley.htm">Mary Shelley</a> (<i>Frankenstein</i>, 1818),  <a href="hcanders.htm">Hans Christian Andersen</a> ('The Ugly Duckling',  1845), <a href="fdosto.htm">Fyodor Dostoyevsky </a>(<i>Crime and Punishment</i>,  1866), Bram Stoker (<i>Dracula</i>, 1897), <a href="kafka.htm">Franz Kafka</a>  ('Metamorphosis', 1915).</p>

<p>Stevenson's father died in 1887. From the late 1880s, Stevenson
lived with his family in the South Seas, where he had purchased an
estate in Vailima, Samoa. During this period of his life, Stevenson
enjoyed a comparative
good health. With his stepson Lloyd Osbourne he wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wrong Box</span>
(1889) and other works. He had nearly 20 servants and was known as
'Tusitala' or 'Teller of the Tales'. The writer himself translated it
'Chief White Information.' Fanny was called 'Flying Cloud' &#8211; perhaps
referring to her restlessness. She had also suffered a mental breakdown
in 1893. </p>
<p>In his short story 'The Bottle Imp', set on the island of Hawaii,
Stevenson asked the question, does a sudden luck of fortune wipe out
one's problems. Keawe, a poor man, buy's a bottle, tempered in the
flames of hell. An imp lives inside it and is at the buyer's command
fulfilling all desires. "'Here am I now upon my high place,' he said to
himself. 'Life may be no better; this is the mountain top; and all
shelves about me toward the worse. For the first time I will light up
the chambers, and bathe in my fine bath with the hot water and the
cold, and sleep above in the bed of my bridal chamber.'" Fascinated by the Polynesian culture, Stevenson
wrote several letters to <i>The Times</i> on the islanders' behalf and
published novels <span style="font-style: italic;">Island Nights' Entertainments</span>&nbsp; (1893), which contains his famous story 'The Beach of Falesá', and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ebb-Tide</span> (1894),
which condemned the European colonial exploitation. </p>

<p>Stevenson died of a brain haemorrhage on December 3, 1894, in
Vailima. Fanny Stevenson died in 1914 in California. Her ashes were
taken to Samoa and buried alonside her husband, on the summit of Mount
Vaea. Stevenson's last work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Weir of Hermiston</span> (1896), was left unfinished, but  is considered his masterpiece. His best-known work of horror, <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>, has since his death prompted several sequels by other hands, including <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Holmes</i> by Loren D. Estelman (1979), <i>Jekyll, Alias Hyde: A Variation</i> by Donald Thomas (1988), <i>The Jekyll Legacy</i> by Robert Bloch and Andre Norton (1990) and <i>Mary Reilly</i> by Valrie Matin (1990). </p>
