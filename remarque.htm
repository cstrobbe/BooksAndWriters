<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->German writer, who became famous with 
his novel <span class="st"><em>Im Westen nichts Neues</em></span>
(tr. All Quiet on the Western Front, 1929), which depicted the horrors
of war from the point of view of the ordinary soldiers. In
his&nbsp;books Remarque focused largely on the collapse of the old
European world and values. Although his later works also were
successful, Remarque lived in the shadow of his "big" first book. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is just as much a matter of chance
that I am still alive as that I might have been hit. In a bomb-proof
dug-out I may be smashed to atoms and in the open may survive ten
hour's bombardment unscratched. No soldier outlives a thousand chances.
But every soldier believes in Chance and trusts his luck."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">All Quiet on the Western Front</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>


<p>Erich Maria Remarque was born in Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, into
modest circumstances. His ancestors were French, the family name was
'Germanized' early in the nineteeth century. Peter Franz Remark,
Remarque's father, was a poorly paid bookbinder. Although Franz Remark
did not show much interest in intellectual activities, except his
interest in the occult, the family had a piano, and at one point in his
life Remarque planned a musical career. Once he played the organ in an
insane asylum. </p><p>In 1904, at the age of six, Remarque entered the
Domschule (cathedral school), and four years later he moved to the
Johannisschle. Remarque was "always the best in class", as one of his
closest school friends later recalled. For a time Remarque studied at
the University of Münster, but had to enlist in the German army at the
age of 18. He was trained in Osnabrück and at a camp on the Lüneburg
Heath, and then sent to&nbsp;the Western Front. In Flanders he
witnessed the start of the offensive known as Third Ypres battle; the
German losses are&nbsp;generally estimated at between 500,000 and
660,000. Remarque was wounded by British forces at Dixmunde and the
rest of the war he spent virtually in a milirary hospital in Duisburg.
After his discharge Remarque took a teacher's course offered to
veterans by the government. He taught for a year in a school, and tried
also his hand as a stonecutter and a test-cardriver for a Berlin tire
company. </p>
<p>Remarque began his writing career as a sporting journalist, eventually becoming the assistant editor of <i>Sportbild</i>.
During this period he developed a lifelong&nbsp;passion for racing
cars, especially he loved Italian Lancias. Among his friends was Leni
Riefenstahl, who later made the Nazi propaganda film <i>Triumph of the Will</i> (1935), and the two-part <i>Olympia </i>(1938),
about the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. In 1925 Remarque married&nbsp;
Jutta Ilse Ingeborg Ellen Zambona, "tall, slender as a fashion model,
and strikingly dressed", as Riefenstahl described Jutta in her book of
memoir. From the beginning, their&nbsp;marriage was stormy, both had
extra-marital activities, too.&nbsp;After divorce in 1930&nbsp;Remarque
remarried her in 1938; this time to help her to&nbsp;move from Germany
to Switzwerland. Officially they divorced in 1957. </p><p>His longest,
intercontinental affair Remarque had with Dietrich; they met&nbsp;at
the Venice Lido in the late 1930s. For some reason, Remarque told her
that he was&nbsp; impotent.&nbsp; "Oh, how wonderful!" Dietrich said
and followed him to Paris. She&nbsp;was married to Rudi Sieber, an
assistant director. Rudi's presence did not bother Remarque, but
when&nbsp;Dietrich&nbsp;entered into a liaison with Marion Carstairs, a
tattoed, rich heiress, he began to drink heavily. "I always thought he
had the look of a debonair fox, like an illustration of the Fables of
La Fontaine, even the tops of his ears pointed slightly",&nbsp;recalled
Dietrich's daughter in her biography of her mother. </p><p><em>All Quiet on the Westerns Front</em>
touched a nerve of the time, and sparkled off a storm of political
controversy. The book, which first had been rejected by one publisher,
sold 1.2 million copies in its first year. H.L. Mencken called it
"unquestionably the best story of the World War." Its sequel, <span class="st"><em>Der Weg zurück</em> </span>(The
Way Back),&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1931. It dealt with the collapse of
the German Army after the war, and the fate of the surviving heroes,
Ernst and his friends. </p>
<blockquote><i>All Quiet on the Western Front </i>is<b> </b>the most
famous novel dealing with World War I. The book starts in 1917 after a
battle, in which half of Paul Bäumer's company has been killed. Bäumer
is mostly the narrator and Remarque goes through his life in
flashbacks. Paul and his classmates have been encouraged by their
teacher, Kantorek, to enlist the German army. Bäumer's group includes
some school fellows, and Katczinsky, an older man. <b></b>The
group goes through basic training and go to the front. Bäumer tries to
understand what is going on. He realizes that back home "no one had the
vaguest idea what we were in for. The wisest were just the poor and
simple people. They knew the war to be a misfortune, whereas those who
were better off, and should have been able to see more clearly what the
consequences&nbsp;would be, were beside themselves with joy." Paul
visits home on leave, returns to the trenches, is wounded and sent to a
military hospital. In the summer of 1918 German front is pushed back,
and the soldiers are waiting for the end of the war. In October, when
there is nothing much to report on the western front, Paul is killed, a
week or so before the armistice.&nbsp; The story is narrated in first
person in a cool style, a contrast to patriotic rhetoric. Remarque
records the daily horrors in the trenches, where machine guns killed
millions, in laconic understatement. "At the next war let all the
Kaisers, Presidents and Generals and diplomats go into a big field and
fight it out first among themselves. That will satisfy us and keep us
home." (Katzinsky) Lewis Milestone's&nbsp;adaptation from the novel, is
a landmark of American cinema of the 1930s. One of the best scenes is
when Paul (Lew Ayres) returns to his school and tells new students the
truth. "When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die
at all." The film was denounced by Goebbels as anti-German, but the
Poles banned it for being pro-German. Particularly effective were the
tracking shots of soldiers attacking enemy lines. In France it was
prohibited until 1962. The close-up of Paul's hand reaching for the
butterfly at the end, is actually the hand of the director Milestone. A
sequel, <i>The Road Back</i>, was made in 1937. <font size="2">
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>With <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> Remarque became a
spokesman of "a generation that was destroyed by war, even though it
might have escaped its shells," as he said himself. The German defeat
inspired two major war films of the year 1930&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; G.W. Pabst's
<i>Westfront 1918</i>, adapted from a novel by Ernest Johannsen and
Lewis Milestone's film based on Remarque's novel. Milestone was unhappy
with the original script&nbsp;&#8211; he saw it changed the point of the
book, and he hired his friend Del Andrews and George Abbott, a stage
director, the shape the final script. The producer Carl Laemmle Junior
and Milestone both hated the original ending of the book, in which Paul
Baumer dies heroically. Karl Freund, the cameraman, put forward the
idea of the hand stretching out toward the butterfly. </p>
<p>In the 1930s Remarque's books were banned in Germany by the government. <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> and <i>The Road Back</i>
were among the works consigned to be publicly burnt in 1933. Stores
were ordered to stop selling his works. The film's premiere was
disrupted by Nazi gangs; Remarque was accused of pacifism and
slandering the German soldier. It was not until the 1950s the film was
shown again in West Germany. The Nazis tortured and guillotined&nbsp;
Remarque's sister, Elfriede Scholz, in 1943. The judge reputedly
commenting that if the brother could not be caught, the sister would
stand in his place. </p><p>Remarque lost his citizenship in 1938, but
he had moved to Switzerland in 1932 and in 1939, following Marlene
Dietrich,&nbsp;he emigrated to the United States. In
Hollywood,&nbsp;Remarque had close relationships with such stars<strong> </strong>as
Dolores del Rio, Maureen O'Sullivan, and Paulette Goddard (1911-1990),
whom he married in 1958; she had been Charlie Chaplin's third
wife.&nbsp;Soon after moving to New York, Remarque had a romance with
Greta Garbo. On their first recorded date they went to the movies to
see <em>That Hamilton Woman</em>, a love story starring Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. While watching the film, they munched popcorn. </p><p>Remarque's
favorite&nbsp;night clubs&nbsp;in New York were the Stork Club, Ciro's,
and 21. After the war&nbsp;he settled eventually back in Switzerland,
where he made his residence at Porto Ronco on the Swiss shore of Lake
Maggiore.&nbsp;Remarque spent also much time in Italy. His play,&nbsp;<em>Die letzte Station</em>,
about the fall of the Third Reich, was produced in Berlin in 1956. When
the&nbsp;city of Osnabrück decided to award&nbsp;Remarque the
Julius&nbsp;Möser Medal, &nbsp;he did not answer to this call to visit
his birthplace. Eventually the&nbsp;authorities traveled to Porto
Ronco. "Touching and boring," Remarque noted, though as a perfect host,
he had a special cake made for the delegation, decorated with the
city's coat of arms and the titles of all of his novels in marzipan. In
1967&nbsp;he received the Grosses Verdienstkreuz of the Federal
Republic of Germany. Remarque died at the Sant Agnese clinic at
Locarno, on September 25, 1970. He had suffered for months from
aneurysm. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"If things went according to the
death notices, man would be absolutely perfect. There you find only
first-class fathers, immaculate husbands, model children, unselfish,
self-sacrificing mothers, grandparents mourned by all, businessmen in
contrast with whom Francis of Assisi would seem an infinite egoist,
generals dripping with kindness, humane prosecuting attorneys, almost
holy munitions makers&nbsp;</strong></font><font size="2">&#8211;<strong> in short, the earth seems to have been populated by a horde of wingless angels without one's having been aware of it." </strong>(in <i>The Black Obelisk</i>, 1956) </font></blockquote>

<p>Remarque's later works, depicting the political upheavals of Europe
from the 1920s to the cold war, did not achieve the critical acclaim of
his first novel. However, his skill to create interesting characters,
fascinating plots, and balancing between realistic and sentimental
scenes made him a highly popular writer. <em>Drei Kameraden</em>
(1937) received good reviews and was made into a film in 1938, directed
by Frank Borzage. The screenplay was written by Edward A. Paramore and <a href="fsfitzg.htm">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>,
who was determined to do a good job. Fitzgerald kept completely sober,
for a while. However, his contract with M-G-M was not renewed. The
final scene in which the two friends of the story are joined by their
ghostly comrade, has still a strong emotional charge.&nbsp;</p><p>Several of Remarque's later novels dealt with people struggling under Nazi rule.&nbsp; <em>Arc de Triomphe</em> (Arch of Triumph<em>,</em>
1946)&nbsp;was about a German refugee physician and an actress, Joan
Madou, who was&nbsp;modelled after Marlene Dietrich: "He saw a pale
face, high cheek-bones and wide-set eyes. The face was rigid and
masklike . . . a face whose openness was its secret. It neither hid nor
revealed anything. It promised nothing and thereby everything." The
story was adapted into screen in 1947, starring Charles Boyer and
Ingrid Bergman. Remarque himself played the schoolmaster Pohlmann in <i>A Time to Love and a Time to Die</i> (1958), based on his novel&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben</em></span>
(1954). In the story a German soldier, Ernst Graeber, on furlough from
the Russian front, falls in love with his childhood friend, Elisabeth.
But he must return to the trenches. The German edition was censored for
its "unnational" passages. Douglas Sirk's film version, beautifully
photographed in CinemaScope, ends dramatically in Graeber's death. </p>

<p><i>Spark of Life </i>(1952) was a fictional documentary about life in Nazi concentration camps.<i> The Black Obelisk</i> (1956) was a tragi-comedy, in which Remarque explored the chaotic Germany of in the 1920s. Remarque's screenplay <i>The Last 10 Days</i> for G.W. Pabst's film from 1956, was based Judge Michael A. Musmanno's book <i>10 Days to Die</i>, a study of the death of Hitler in a Berlin bunker. <em>Die Nacht von Lissabon</em> (1962, The Night in Lisbon), in which two refugees from Nazism flee in Portugal, and <em>Schatten im Paradies</em>, depicting refugees in the United Sates, were published posthumously in English in 1971. </p>
