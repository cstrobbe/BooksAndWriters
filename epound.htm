<p>
<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American poet and critic, often
called "the
poet's poet" because his profound influence on 20th century writing
in English. Pound believed that poetry is the highest of arts. A rebel
par excellence, he challenged many of the common views of his time and
spent 12 years in an American mental hospital. Pound's major work was
the <i>Cantos</i>, which was published in ten sections between 1925 and 1969, and then as a one-volume collected edition, <em>The Cantos of Ezra Pound I-CXVII</em> (1970). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The Proper METHOD for studying poetry
and good letters is the method of contemporary biologists, that is
careful first-hand examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON
of one 'slide' or specimen with another."</b></font><font size="2"></font>

<font size="2">(in <i>ABC of Reading</i>, 1934</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Ezra Pound was born in Hailey, Idaho, but he was brought up in
Wyncote, Philadelphia. His father, Homer Loomis Pound, worked as an
assistant assayer at the US Mint.&nbsp;
At the age of twelve Pound entered Cheltenham, a military school, where
he was introduced to Greek and Latin. He then studied languages at the
University of Pennsylvania, and befriended there the young William
Carlos Williams (1883-1963), who gained later fame as a poet in New
York's avant-garde circles. From 1903 to 1906 Pound studied Anglo-Saxon
and Romance languages at Hamilton College. In 1907 his teaching career
was cut short at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, when he had
entertained an actress in his room.</p>

<p>In 1908 Pound travelled widely in Europe, working as a journalist. His first book of poems, <em>A Lume Spento</em>&nbsp;(1908),
was privately printed by A. Antonini in Venice. Inspired by the work of
Yeats, he went to London because he thought "Yeats knew more about
poetry than anybody else": He founded with Richard Aldington
(1892-1962) and others the literary 'Imagism', and edited its first
anthology, <i>Des Imagistes</i> (1914). The movement was influenced by thoughts of Rémy de Gourmont whose book, <i>The Natural Philosophy of Love</i>
(1904), Pound translated later, and T.E. Hulme (1883-1917), who
stressed the importance of fresh language and true perception on
nature. In his cautions, published in <i>Poetry</i> in 1913, Pound wrote: "Don't use such an expression as 'dim lands of <i>peace</i>'.
It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes
from the writer's not realizing that the natural object is always the <i>adequate</i> symbol." </p>
<p>In their manifesto the Imagists promised: "1. Direct treatment of
the 'thing' whether subject or objective. 2. To use absolutely no word
that does not contribute to the presentation. 3. As regarding rhythm:
to compose in the sequence of musical phrase, not in sequence of a
metronome." Pound's short "one-image poem" 'In a Station of the Metro'
is among the most celebrated Imagist works: "The apparition of these
faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough." Pound had seen a
succession of beautiful faces one day on the Paris Metro, and in the
evening he found suddenly the expression for his sudden emotion. </p>
<p>Pound soon lost interest in Imagism <font face="Symbol">-</font> he did not abandon totally formulaic verse <font face="Symbol">-</font>
and after disputing with the poet Amy Lowell, Pound called the movement
"Amygism." With Wyndham Lewis and the sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska,
who was killed in 1915, he founded 'Vorticism', which produced a
magazine, <i>Blast</i>. He helped Wyndham Lewis, <a href="tseliot.htm">T.S. Eliot</a> and <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a> to publish their works in the magazines <i>Egoist</i> and <i>Poetry</i>.
When he worked in 1913-14 as W.B. Yeats's secretary, he started a
correspondence with Joyce. After their first meeting the Irish poet had
said that Pound "can't sing as he has no voice", but later called him a
solitary volcano; Wyndham Lewis said he was the Trotsky of literature.
Pound wrote on Joyce on various magazines, collected money for him, and
even sent spare clothes for him. Pound also played crucial role in the
cutting of Eliot's<i> The Waste Land</i>. Eliot dedicated the work to him, as <i>il miglior fabbro</i>
(the better maker). In 1914 Pound married the artist Dorothy
Shakespear, "surely the most charming woman in London," as Pound
described her to his mother. After a vacation in Egypt, Dorothy
conceived in 1926 a child, Omar. <br>
</p>
      <p>Disenchanted with English life and culture, Pound created an
alter ego, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, through whose voice Arnold Bennett
says, "No one knows, at sight a masterpiece. / And give up verse, my
boy, / There's nothing in it." Moreover, he had lost his close friends,
the sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and T.E. Hulme to the war. In 1922
Pound started his relationship
with the violinist Olga Rudge, with whom he had a daughter, born five
months before Omar. From this period date one of Pound's most widely
read poems,<em> Homage to Sextus Propertius</em> (1919). </p>

<p>Pound has been called the "inventor" of Chinese poetry for our time.
Beginning in 1913 with the notebooks of the Orientalist Ernest
Fenollosa, he pursued a lifelong study of ancient Chinese texts, and
translated among others the writings of Confucius. Pound's translations
based on Fenollosa's notes, collected in <em>Cathay</em> (1915), are
considered among the most beautiful of his writings. Dante and Homer
became other sources for inspiration, and especially Dante's journey
through the realms have parallels with his examination of individual
experiences in the<i> Cantos</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>And round about there is a rabble </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Of the filthy, study, unkillable infants of the very poor. </font><br>
<font size="2">They shall inherit the earth. </font></b><font size="2"></font><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'The Garden', 1913, 1916) </font></blockquote>



<p>In 1920 Pound moved to Paris <font face="Symbol">-</font> Britain
had become him "an old bitch, gone in the teeth." Four years later her
settled in Italy, where he lived over 20 years, comfortable with his
role as an outsider. He met Mussolini in 1933 and saw in him the
long-needed economic and social reformer. In his anti-Semitic
statements Pound agreed with those who believed that the economic
system was being exploited by Jewish financiers. Banknotes were for him
a symbol of&nbsp; phoniness. The Fascists dismissed Pound's Utopia as
"the botched plan of a nebulous mind devoid of any sense of reality". <br>
 </p><p>During World War II&nbsp;Pound made in Rome a series of
hysterical and bitter radio broadcasts, that were openly fascist. In
one of his radio talks he suggested that "if some man had a stroke of
genius, and could start a pogrom against Jews... there might de
something to say for it." One of his ideas was that the USA should cede
Guam to the Japanese in exchange for 300 film reels of Noh drama. In
1945 he was arrested by the U.S. forces and put in a six foot by six
foot "gorilla cage" <font face="Symbol">-</font> he was still an American citizen. Surrounded by barbed wire and exposed to the sun, Pound assembled his <span style="font-style: italic;">Cantos</span> for that period. <br>
</p>
      <p>Labelled as paranoid by the examining psychiatrists in a
trial, Pound spent 12 years in Washington, D.C., in a hospital for the
criminally insane. The poet Diane di Prima, who corresponded with
Pound, visited him at the hospital and spent time with him there. She
later befriended Allen Ginsberg and&nbsp;Jack Kerouac and described a
Beat orgy with them in her erotic autobiography<em> Memoirs of a Beatnik</em> (1969). </p>
<p>It has been suggested that Pound was feigning insanity to escape the
death penalty, but the treason indictment did not drastically affect
his ability to write and translate poetry. During this period he
received the 1949 Bollingen Prize for his<i> Pisan Cantos</i>, which
concerned his imprisonment at the camp near Pisa. After Pound was
released from St. Elizabeth's hospital due to the actions and efforts
of his last living protégé, Eustace Mullins, he returned to Italy,
where he spent his remaining years. <br>
</p>
      <p>Pound died on November 1, 1972, in Venice. According to
Katherine Anne Porter, "Pound was one of the most opinionated and
unselfish men who ever lived, and he made friends and enemies
everywhere by the simple exercise of the classic American
constitutional right of free speech."<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">The Letters of E.P., 1907-1941</font></i><font size="2">, review in</font><i><font size="2"> New York Times Book Review</font></i><font size="2">, 29 Oct. 1950)
</font><font size="2">
</font>
      </p>


<p>Pound published over 70 books and translated Japanese plays and
Chinese poetry. The <i>Cantos</i>, a series of poems which he wrote from 1920s
throughout his life, are considered among his best achievements. Its last volume was&nbsp;<em>Drafts and Fragments of Cantos CX- CXVII</em> (1968). Arthur Miller denounced his work as "sheer obscenity". <br>
</p>
      <p>In the<i> Cantos </i>Pound recorded the poet's spiritual quest
for transcendence, and intellectual search for worldly wisdom. However,
he did not try to imitate classical epic, but had several heroes
instead of one, and projected his own self into his characters. His
models were Dante's <i>La divina commedia</i> (c. 1320) and <a href="browning.htm">Robert Browning</a>'s confessional poem <i>Sordello</i> (1840). Pound's Hell is typified with liberalism, capitalism, and cultural degeneration. Just as Beatrice guided <a href="dante.htm">Dante</a>'s pilgrim, so also classical goddesses appear in the<i> Cantos</i>.
In addition, through mythical, historical, and contemporary figures
Pound mirrored the poetry and ideas of the past and present. Canto
LXXII and Canto LXXIII were not published in the early collections due
to their controversial&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> fascist&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> thoughts. </p>



<p>Pound's style was clear, economical and concrete. "Great literature
is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree,"
he once said. As an essayist Pound wrote mostly about poetry. From the
mid-1920s
he examined the ways economic systems promote or debase culture. "Why
the hell don't the schools give a little rudimentary education in
economics, the history of economics, and in the use of language," he
wrote in 1933 in a letter to the Idaho senator William Borah, trying to
recruit him in the mainly one-sided correspondence as an advocate of
his radical political and economic theories. Pound hoped, that fascism
could establish the sort of society in which the arts could flourish.
He also argued that poetry is not "entertainment", and as an elitist he
did not appreciate the common reader. </p>
<p>Pound considered American culture isolated from the traditions that
make the arts possible, and depicted Walt Whitman as "exceedingly
nauseating pill". Pound's most influential publications on aesthetics
are <em>ABC of Reading </em>(1934), which summarized his aesthetic theory and is said to have 
established the modernist poetic technique, and <em>The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry</em> (pub. 1936), 
compiled from the notes of Ernest Fenollosa.</p>

 <b>Imagism: </b>a
short-lived movement of American and English poets, whose verse was
characterized by concrete language and figures of speech, modern
subject matter, freedom in the use of meter, and avoidance of mystical
themes. Members of the movement included Hilda Doolittle, Richard
Aldington, F.S. Flint, T.E. Hulme, John Gould Fletcher, Harriet Monroe,
Amy Lowell, whom Pound did not consider an imagist, but called her
attempts "Amygism".&nbsp;Imagism also influenced </font><a href="caiken.htm"><font size="2">Conrad Aiken</font></a><font size="2">, Marianne Moore, </font><a href="wsteven.htm"><font size="2">Wallace Stevens</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="dhlawren.htm"><font size="2">D.H.
