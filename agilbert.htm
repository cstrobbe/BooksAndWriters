<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific British mystery writer, a woman
writing under a man's name, whose most
famous creation is lawyer-detective Arthur G. Crook. For many years,
Gilbert's identity was kept secret; readers assumed that the author was
a man. Distinctive for Gilbert's novels is skillful plotting, lively
supporting characters, entertaining dialogue, and clever action without
exaggerating violence. She wrote straight fiction &#8211; mostly with a
Victorian flavor &#8211; under the pseudonym of Anne Meredith. </p>
<blockquote><font color="White">-<b>-</b></font><b><font size="2">'"Mrs.
Warren said speculatively, "I wonder why it is people always regard
marriage as something comic &#8211; unmarried people, I mean. Married ones
don't." </font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">Her husband opened one eye to murmur, "Of course not." </font> </b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Body on the Beam</font></i><font size="2">, 1932) </font></blockquote>
<p>Anthony Gilbert was born Lucy Beatrice Malleson in Upper Norwood,
London; the city remained her home for the rest of her life. Malleson
was educated at St. Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith. Her mother hoped
that she would become a teacher. After her father, who was a
stockbroker, was thrown out of work in 1914, Malleson took a course in
shorthand and typing to earn living for the family. She worked as a
secretary for the Red Cross, Ministry of Food, and Coal Association.
Ignoring her mother's plans to make her a schoolteacher, she fulfilled
her own ambition as a writer. At the age of seventeen, Malleson had
published poems in <i>Punch </i>and literary weeklies. In 1925, she published her first book,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Man Who Was London</span>, under the name J. Kilmeny Keith. </p>
<p>After seeing John Willards' play <i>The Cat and the Canary,</i> Malleson decided to try her skills at the thriller genre.  These early efforts were a failure. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Tragedy at Freyne</span>
(1927), written under the pseudonym Anthony Gilbert, was well reviewed.
The story introduced Scott Egerton, a rising young British political
leader, who then solved crimes in some ten novels. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Body on the Beam</span>
(1932) Egerton examined the death of a young woman of dubious
reputation, whose body is found hanging in a third-rate lodging-house.
A young man is arrested, but Egerton approaches the problem from a
different angle and builds up an equally strong case against another
man from the woman's past, and traps the real criminal. </p>

<p>Malleson's first Arthur G. Crook novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">Murder by Experts</span> (1936). 
It gained an enormous success and Malleson dropped Egerton. During the years 
G. Crook developed from rather unattractive Cockney character into a strong and popular 
personality, although he is not generally the protagonist of the story. Crook 
featured in some 50 novels. Frequently he comes to help when a woman or 
a children is in peril, as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Missing from Her Home</span> (1969), 
where a nine-year-old girl vanishes while on a trip to the supermarket.  
In <span style="font-style: italic;">And Death Came Too</span> (1956) Crook helps Ruth Appleyard, who is involved 
in several questionable death cases. <span style="font-style: italic;">A Question of Murder</span> (1955) was a 
about a young woman who is suspected of murdering a boarder. 
As in the television series Columbo, starring Peter Falk, Crook 
is badly dressed and murders usually are unaware that they are soon 
in a trap. But when Columbo intuition always guides him to the right 
suspect, Crook thinks beforehand thant his clients cannot be guilty. He is 
the Criminals' Hope and the Judges Despair," as he calls himself. </p>

<p>Malleson was also an avid theater-goer. She wrote more than 25 radio plays, 
broadcasted in Great Britain and overseas. On the radio, she often associated with 
John Dickson Clark. Malleson's thriller, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Woman in Red</span> (1941), about a secretary, 
whose employer drugs her and tries to drive her mad to cover a murder, was broadcast 
in the United States by CBS and made into a film under the title <i>My Name is Julia 
Ross</i>
(1945), directed by Joseph H. Lewis, starring Nina Foch. "A likeable,
unpretentious, generally successful attempt to turn good trash into
decently artful entertainment," said James Agee of the film. Between
the years 1934 and 1962, Malleson published 20 straight novels and one
mystery, <span style="font-style: italic;">Portrait of a Murderer</span> (1934) under the name Anne Meredith. 
This work was an "inverted mystery", which had been invented by R. 
Austin Freeman (1862-1943); the identity of the murderer or criminal is given 
away at the beginning. </p>

<p>Malleson's autobiography,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Three-a-Penny</span> (1940), was  published under the name Anne 
Meredith. It dealt with her childhood, struggle with poverty, development of her literary interests, 
women's rights, and her life as a popular writer. "I like being a writer," she once said 
in an interview, "which is just as well, as I clearly could not be anything else." 

Malleson's  short stories were published 
from the 1940s in several anthologies, and such periodicals as <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery 
Magazine</i> and <i>The Saint</i>. Among these was 'The Mills of God', a poignant and 
heartbreaking crime story about abortion <i><font size="2">(EQMM</font></i><font size="2">, 
April 1969)</font>. Also the short story 'Fifty Years After', written under the name of Anthony 
Gilbert, dealt with the theme. "Salts of lemon was a common way out of trouble for girls 
who'd fallen into it. Easy to come by &#8211; you said you wanted it to clean a straw hat &#8211; 
a penn'orth or two-penn'orth over the counter and no questions asked." 
<font size="2">(from <i>Ellery Queen's Murdercade</i>, 1976) </font>One of her stories, 
'A True Account', was adapted for <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> in 1959 and another, 
'You'll Be the Death of Me'  for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1963. </p>
<p>Malleson's short story 'You Can't Hang Twice' received a Queens award 
in 1946. 'Door to a Different World', published in <i>EQMM</i>,
was an Edgar Award nominee in 1971. Malleson was a founding member of
the British Detection Club, she also served as its General Secretary.
Malleson never married. She died on December 9, 1973. Her cousin was
the actor, playwright and scriptwriter Miles Malleson, who appeared in
such films as <i>Kind Hearts and Coronets</i> (1949), <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> (1952), and <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> (1959) </p>
