      <p>Czech novelist, short-story writer, political thinker,
playwright, and teacher. Karel &#268;apek's play <i>R.U.R.: Rossum's
Universal Robots</i> (1920) added to <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>
a new word, "robot." It was derived from the Czech "robota", meaning
someting like "work" or "serf", "forced labor", referring originally to
dull work. &#268;apek's robots were not mechanical but humanlike beings of
flesh and blood &#8211; now they would be called androids. Later the term was
applied to machines. Along with Kafka and Jaroslav Hasek, the author of
      <i>The Good Soldier Svejk</i>, &#268;apek is among the great figures
of modern Czech literature. </p>
      <blockquote><b>"<font size="2">Young Rossum invented a worker
with the minimum amount of requirements. He had to simplify him. He
rejected everything that did not contribute directly to the progress of
work. He rejected everything that makes man more expensive. In fact, he
rejected man and made the Robot. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not
people. Mechanically they are more perfect than we are, they have an
enormously developed intelligence, but they have no soul. Have you ever
seen what a Robot looks like inside?"</font></b><font size="2"> (in <i>R.U.R</i>.,
1920, translated by Paul Selver)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Karel
&#268;apek was born in Malé Svatonovice, Bohemia,
Austria-Hungary (now in Czech Republic). His father, Antonín &#268;apek, a
country doctor, was a voracious reader whose own library was filled
with books of history, philosophy, general&nbsp; culture, world
literature, and also fairy tales. The children were encouraged to use
it. &#268;apek's mother Bo&#382;ena Capková pampered her son in his
otherwise normal, happy childhood. Josef (1887-1945), &#268;apek's elder
brother, became known as a painter, novelist, and dramatist who
occasionally collaborated with his younger brother. Their sister,
Helena (1886-1969), wrote a few novels. </p>
      <p>While
still at
a grammar school in Hradec Králové, &#268;apek started to write poetry and
short stories. To his first love, the beautiful "Anielka," the daughter
of the local organist and music teacher, he wrote letters. She later
married his school mate. Some of&#268;apek's poems were published in a
student magazine. In 1909 he entered Charles University in Prague,
where
he studied philosophy, and then continued his studies in Berlin at the
Frederick William University (now the <span class="st">Humboldt
University of Berlin<strong>)</strong></span>, and at the Sorbonne in
Paris, receiving his doctorate in 1915. His thesis on "Objective
Methods in Aesthetics, with Reference to Creative Art" (Objektivní
metoda v estetice se zrením k vytvarnému umení)&nbsp;was extremely well
received by his professors. &#268;apek's first book, <i>Zárivé hlubiny</i>,
written with Josef,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1916. It was followed by <i>Bo&#382;i
muka</i> (1917, Wayside Crosses), a collection of gloomy stories. Josef
illustrated many of the books, including <i>Zahradníkuv rok </i>(1929,
The Gardener's Year), a several times reprinted collection of gardening
pieces. </p>
      <p>During World War I &#268;apek worked temporarily as a librarian at the Museum of the Bohemian Kingdom in Prague and
as a tutor in &#381;lutice to the son of Count Vladimir La&#382;anský, an outspoken
nationalist who ordered only Czech to be spoken in his household. Due to his physical disabilities,<em></em>
delicate constitution and spondyloarthritis of the vertebral column, he
was found unfit for military service. In 1917 &#268;apek setted in Prague,
where joined the editorial board of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Národ </span>weekly and became editor of the newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">Národní listy</span>. When his brother was dismissed from the paper as a result o his political views, &#268;apek left as well. He then began to
contribute to the, <i>Lidové Noviny</i>, Brno's liberal and popular daily paper, where he stayed until his death. <br>
</p>
      <p>In his columns
&#268;apek's often wrote in a familiar tone about such issues as frost
flowers forming on a windowpane, or how humankind would move more
efficiently if people had wheels instead of legs. A majority of his
essays were playful or humorous, but he also dealt with politics,
mysteries, and aesthetic life. &#268;apek's satirical view in the story,
'War With the Newts,' was praised by Thomas Mann. Articles on Nazism
and racism, and crisis of democracy in Europe, have not lost their
topicality. </p>

      
      <p>&#268;apek's work show the influence of William James, and the
philosophers Ortega y Gasset and Henri Bergson. He was also interested
in the works of <a href="../../../hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>,
who
depicted future world, and Bernard Shaw, who examined in his plays
social and philosophical problems. In the 1920s &#268;apek's translation of
French symbolist poets influence deeply Czech poetry. A reader of
mystery novels, he visited Baker Street and Dartmoor on his 1924 trip
to England. While&nbsp; in London, &#268;apek delivered a speech at the
International PEN Club, and met H.G. Wells, G.K. Chesterton, and G.B.
Shaw. Upon his initiative, the Prague branch of the PEN was established
in 1925. &#268;apek was elected as its President. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1920 &#268;apek  met a young actress, Olga
Scheinpflugová, who had the central role in his play <i>Loupe&#382;ník</i>.
During the following fifteen years, she was the object of his
passionate love and adoration. &#268;apek wrote her many letters, and
eventually they married in 1935. Enchanted by the beauty of V&#283;ra
Hr&#367;zová, the daughter of a professor, he also corresponded with her for
almost eleven years. She inspired the heroine of<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>the novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> Krakatit</span> (1924).&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>As a playwright &#268;apek collaborated with his brother in several productions. One of their mutual acquaintances was the composer Leo&#353; Janá&#269;ek. Josef designed the sets for Janá&#269;ek's Prague 1925 production of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cunning Little Vixen</span>, his seventh opera, and Karel's <span style="font-style: italic;">V&#283;c Makropulos</span> (1924) provided the basis for Janá&#269;ek's next opera. After <i>Adam stvoritel</i> 
(pub.1927), another collaboration, he wrote no more plays until 1937. His 
first stage work, <i>The Fateful Game of Love</i>,
was written in 1910 and produced in 1930. &#268;apek worked also as the art
director of the National Art Theater and was closely associated with
the Vinohrady Theatre. In 1922, mentally and physically exhausted, he
gave up his post at the Vinohrady Theatre, and left for Italy. &#268;apek's travel sketches were collected in  <span style="font-style: italic;">Italské listy</span> (1923, Letters from Italy).&nbsp; </p>

      <p>&#268;apek often focused on large, philosophical themes. Like his
contemporary expressionist playwrights and filmmakers, he employed
elements from science fiction and fantasy and was not particularly
interested in portraying everyday life. In the three-act symbolic
fantasy <i>R.U.R</i>.
Dr. Gall, who works in the off-shore Rossum's Universal Robots company,
has created robots which can feel
pain; in this they differ from their predecessors, the Jewish Golem and
the alchemical homunculus. The factory's manager, Domin, believes that
robots can liberate humans from labour. A robot revolt breaks out, and
the formula is burned. All but one human is killed. At the end, the
robots discover love, making the discovery of new formula unnecessary.
&#268;apek's play was an immediate success. In 1923 a public discussion
about his robots was held in London featuring luminaries like G.B. Shaw
and G.K. Chesterton. The French writer and Nobel laureate Romain Rolland came to Prague to see R.U.R. in 1924. <br>
</p>
      <p>The film which popularized the idea of robots was Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis</i>
(1926). <a href="../../../asimov.htm">Isaac Asimov</a>'s stories,
collected in<i> I, Robot</i> (1950) made known the celebrated three
laws of robotics. The word ''robot'' was coined by &#268;apek's brother
Josef. <i>The Absolute at Large</i> (1922), &#268;apek's first novel, took
up the theme of the end of the world. In the story a scientist invenst
the Karburator, which product free energy but at the same time
unleashes a destructive otherworldly force with the power to destroy
the whole civilization. </p>

      <p>The satiric comedy <i>Ze Zivota hmyzy </i>(1921, The Insect
Play), written with Josef, was produced in 1922. &#268;apek depicted human
vices through the dreams of a drunken tramp. A female butterflies flirt
with males and kill one, a beetle steals a store of dung, and ants
struggle for power. At the end a number of the flying and dancing
insects die. The tramp, who wrestles with death, too,
eventually&nbsp;faces a new day, saying: "Look--look at the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Look at how much there is to do." An
eyewitness to the Prague production complained, that&nbsp;the constant
"buzzing" of the actors made them all exhausted and sweaty. </p>
      <p>&#268;apek's last drama, <i>Matka</i> (1938) was about a mother,
whose husband and sons are killed fighting for their ideals. She
refuses to allow her youngest son to go against an approaching army
reported to be killing women and children. Finally she gives him a
rifle so that he may join the struggle for humanity. Most of the story
was presented in the form of a dialogue between the mother and the
ghosts of her dead family members.</p>
      <p>In <em>The Insect Play,</em> first performed at the National
Theatre in Brno in&nbsp;1922,&nbsp;and <i>Power and Glory </i>(1937),
which was staged in Prague and Brno, &#268;apek examined how too much
power can corrupt a political leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a friend and
biographer of the first president of Czechoslovak Republic, Tomá&#353;
Masaryk, working with him to unify the country, and recording Masaryk's
political ideas in <i>Hovory s T.G. Masarykem</i>, published in three
volumes between 1928 and 1935. </p>
      <p>&#268;apek's philosophical novel trilogy, <i>Hordubal </i>(1934),<i>
Povetron</i> (1934), and <i>Obycejný &#382;ivot</i> (1934) tries to tell
the same story from a different point of view, centering round problems
of truth and reality. <i>Hordubal</i> was on its surface a story of
crime. In<i> Povetron</i> &#268;apek<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
studied how a few facts about an
unknown man gives room to different interpretations, and in the last
part of the trilogy an ordinary person discovers a complex combination
of different personalities hidden in his own mind. <i>Válka s mloky</i>
(1936) was again a satire on modern science and international politics.
In the story nonhumans again adopt human traits, which lead to
catastrophe &#8211; this time a sea-dwelling race of "newts" are discovered
in the South Pacific and enslaved by human entrepreneurs. With their
new führer the newts start a war agaainst their masters. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Capek's greatness as a writer
often depends not on the success of his conscious intention, but on
what has slipped in, almost in spite of the author.</b></font><b><i><font size="2"> In spite of </font></i><font size="2">his experimentalism,
his use of scientific or philosophic themes, traditional literary
values abound in his works. In spite of his determined effort to come
to grips with life, and unconscious terror of life returns returns
again and again in his work. Though he tried not to admit it, Capek
kept stumbling over the tragedy of life. All his work after Wayside
Crosses is in a sense a defense against the metaphysical horror which
he perceived in that book." </font></b><font size="2">(William E.
Harkins in</font><i><font size="2"> Karel Capek</font></i><font size="2">,
1962) </font></blockquote>
      <p>The
settlement at Munich of September, 1938, by the Western
nations, in which Czechoslovakia was allowed to be overrun by Germany,
was a severe blow to &#268;apek, an ardent spokesman for democracy who had
strongly condemned war and Nazism. On 30 September, 1938, he signed the
writer's declaration 'To the Conscience of the World'. Louis Aragon and
other French writers nominated him for the Nobel Prize. At that time
&#268;apek's health had rapidly deteriorated
&#8211; partly perhaps weakened by his feverish writing and exhaustion.
Suffering from fascist harassment, he took a refuge in Str&#382;, where
worked on his last novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">&#381;ivot a dílo skladatele Foltýna</span> (1939). <br>
</p>
      <p>&#268;apek died of
pneumonia on December 25, 1938, in Prague. After the invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1939 his works were blacklisted by the Nazis. &#268;apek's
brother Joseph was sent in 1939 to a German concentration camp and he
died at Bergen-Belsen in April 1945. During the Communist reign &#268;apek's
work did not gain a full favor of the government and he was considered
having been too international. After S. V. Nikolskij's <span style="font-style: italic;">Karel &#268;apek</span>
(1952) the unofficial ban was lifted, but certain parts of his work
were could not be mentioned. Among his most famous suppressed texts
was 'Why I Am Not a Communist,' published in 1924. <br>
