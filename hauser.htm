<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Hungarian-born British writer on
the history of art and film. Hauser's magnum opus was&nbsp;<i>The
Social History of Art. </i>When the work appeared in English in the
1950s, well before the emergence of the New Left,<strong> </strong>it
stirred up great controversy because of its ideological orientation. It
was not until the 1960s and 1970s that a Marxist approach was accepted
as a natural or fashionable part of academic research in Western
Europe. However, Marxism started to lose its attraction among
intellectuals before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Postmodernist
art historians have rarely made references to Hauser's fundamental
study. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Genuine, progressive art can only
mean a complicated art today. It will never be possible for everyone to
enjoy and appreciate it in equal measure, but the share of the broader
masses in it can be increased and deepened, The preconditions of a
slackening of the cultural monopoly are above all economic and social.
We can do no other than fight for the creation of these preconditions."</b>
(from </font><i><font size="2">Social History of Art</font></i><font size="2">, vol. 4) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Arnold Hauser was born in Temesvar (now Timisoara, Romania),
to a family of assimilated Jews. He studied history of art and
literature at the universities of Budapest, Vienna, Berlin, and Paris.
In Paris his teacher was Henri Bergson who influenced him deeply. To
earn extra income he reported on art, literature and cultural events
for the <i>Temesvári Hírlap</i> (Temesvár News). For a period he was a
teacher at a Budapest Gymnasium. </p>
      <p>In 1916 Hauser became a member of the Budapest Sunday Circle,
which was formed around the critic and philosopher György Lukács. The
group included Karl Mannheim, a sociologist, the writers Béla Balázs,
and the musicians Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály. Mannheim, who had at
first rejected the idea that sociology could be useful in the
understanding of thought, soon became convinced of its utility. Also
Frigyes Antal (1887-1954) applied the sociological method to art. </p>
      <p>During Bela Kun's short-lived Communist dictatorship
in&nbsp;1919, Hauser was in charge of the reform of art education.
After Kun's overthrow, Hauser spent with his bride two years in Italy
doing research work on the history of classical and Italian art and
earned his Ph.D. in Budapest. His dissertation dealt with the problem
of aesthetic systematization. In 1921 he moved to Berlin, where he
studied economics and sociology. By that time he had developed his view
that the problems of art and literature are fundamentally sociological
problems. Three years later, when his wife declared that she wanted to
live closer to Hungary, the couple settled down in Vienna, where Hauser
supported himself as a freelance writer and as publicity agent&nbsp;of
a film company.&nbsp;In between&nbsp;he&nbsp;worked on an unfinished
book, entitled <i>Dramaturgie und Soziologie des Films</i>. Later he
said, that "For me this was the period of collecting data and
experiences which I used much later in the course of my writing my
works on the sociology of art." </p>
      <p>Fleeing the Nazis after the Anschluss in Austria, Hauser
emigrated with his wife to Great Britain; she died of influenze shortly
upon their arrival. Alone and without any regular income, Hauser was
first helped by his old friend Mannheim, who was editing a book series
for Routledge and Kegan Paul. When&nbsp;plans for their work on the
sociology of art were abandoned,&nbsp;he then began to research for <em>The
Social History of Art</em>. It took ten years to finish the Marxist
survey. His magnum opus of more than a thousand pages and 500,000 words
in lenght came out&nbsp;when he was 59. Still following what is going
on in the film world, Hauser also wrote a number of essays about films
for <i>Life and Letters Today</i> and <i>Sight and Sound</i>. From
1951 he was a lecturer on the history of art at the University of
Leeds, and in the late 1950s a visiting professor at Brandeis
University in the United States. While teaching in Leeds, Hauser's
friend <a href="adorno.htm">Theodor Adorno</a>&nbsp;tried to find an
appropiate position for him at a German university. In 1959&nbsp;Hauser
became a teacher at Hornsey College of Art in London. He worked again
in the United States in 1963-65 and then returned to London. </p>
      <p>When Hungarian Radio aired a Budapest-London conversation
between Hauser and Lukács in July 1969, Hauser confessed: "I am not an
orthodox Marxist. My life is devoted to scholarship, not politics. My
task, I feel, is not political." In 1977 Hauser moved to Hungary, where
he became an honorary member of the Academy of Science. He died in
Budapest on January 28, 1978, at the age of 86. </p>
      <p>Hauser's last book, <i>Soziologie der Kunst</i> (1974,
Sociology of Art), which he wrote racing against time and declining
health, investigated the social and economic determinants of art. In
this pessimistic work&nbsp;he distanced himself from Marxism and
historical determinism. "The foreseeable future," he said, "lies in the
shadow of the atom bomb, of political dictatorship, of unbridled
violence and cynical nihilism. Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin left, as a
permanent testament, a feeling of fear and apprehension&nbsp; which
cannot be mastered." Hauser's suggestion that art does not merely
reflect but interacts with society is a widely accepted premise. He
also saw the art establishment and art reviewers as servers of
commercial interests. As in his <i>Social History of Art</i>, Hauser's
approach was Euro-centered and did not pay much attention to
non-Western art.</p>
      <p><i>The Social History of Art </i>was the result of thirty
years of scholarly labour. It traced the production of art from Lascaux
to the Film Age in the framework of changing socio-historical forces.
Adorno's&nbsp;comments on the German version of the book&nbsp;were
praising: "I was completely immersed in your book . . . I felt so
enthusiastic that I can scarcely find words for it, and I shall try to
express that fact. That such a book is still possible in the present
situation is almost miraculous and you have set a standard here that no
responsible thinker with a respect for truth will be able to ignore." </p>
      <p>Hauser opens&nbsp;the work with an attack on the neo-romantic
doctrine of the religious origin of art, stating that "the monuments of
primitive art . . . clearly suggest . . . that naturalism has the prior
claim, so that it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain the
theory of the primacy of an art remote from life and nature." Theodor
Adorno noted in his <i>Aesthetic Theory</i> (1997) that "the most
archaic artistic manifestations are so diffuse that it is as difficult
as it is vain to try to decide what once did and did not count as art."
Hauser divided magic from religion, and assumed that "the Palaeolithic
hunter and painter thought he was in possession of the thing itself in
the picture, thought he had won power over the portrayed by the
portrayal." </p>
      <p>Hauser's thesis was that form and content develop in direct
relation both to concrete material conditions and to cultural
development. Inevitable the process harboured contradictions &#8211; a style
could be "classicist and anti-classicist at the same time". In <i>Mannerism:
The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origin of Modern Art</i> (1965)
Hauser associated mannerism with spiritual crisis; mannerist art was an
expression of the "alienation" of Renaissance man. </p>
      <p>Hauser's Marxist-oriented approach was rejected by critics on
the right, among them the English art historian <a href="gombric.htm">E.H.
Gombrich</a>, whose one-volume <em>The Story of Art</em> (1950),
originally&nbsp; intended for teen-agers,&nbsp;had been published just
before Hauser's study. Gombrich's crushing review of the book was
published originally in <i>The Art Bulletin</i>, March 1953, and later
in <i>Meditations on a Hobby Horse </i>(1963), a collection of
essays. It was a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;academic arrogance
and&nbsp;cheap shots: "If Mr. Hauser finds that he is concerned with
entities in history which constantly elude his grasp, if he finds that
the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy, rationalism and subjectivism
constantly seem to change places in his field of vision, he should ask
himself whether he is looking though a telescope or a
kaleidoscope."&nbsp;Though Gombrich's views reflected the general cold
war attitudes to Marxism, they were also peppered with his own
hostility to generalizations and "historicism". In this he followed the
thoughts of his friend, the philosopher Karl Popper, whose <i>Open
Society and its Enemies </i>(1945) attacked totalitarian ideas from
Plato to Hegel and Marx. Gombrich rejected "dialectical materialism"
and its doctrine of contradictions: "To us non-Hegelians, the term
'contradiction' describes the relations of two 'dictions' or statements
such that they cannot both be true . . ." In his own iconological
studies Gombrich interpreted Renaissance paintings using forgotten
texts, poems, philosophical papers, and letters. This method, developed
by Erwin Panofsky, was characterized by the French sociologist and
philosopher Pierre Bourdieu as "a sort of symbolic gymnastics, like the
rite or the dance . . ." </p>
      <p>However, Hauser's aesthetic judgments were not so radical. He
did not regard the relation between a work of art and social forces as
a simple one-to-one correspondence, nor did he think that artistic
expression could be guided by political doctrines &#8211; "But if even in the
field of economics and politics planning cannot always be solved by
imposing rules of conduct, it is all the less possible in art . . ." A
politically conservative artist can break reactionary conventions and
dogmas. According to Hauser, "every honest artist who describes reality
faithfully and sincerely has an enlightening and emancipating influence
on his age." In this Hauser refers to Engel's analysis of Balzac's <i>Comédie
humaine</i>. But Dickens is another case: ". . . all the characters of
this naturalist are caricatures, all the features of real life are
exaggerated . . . everything is transformed into the stylized,
simplified and stereotyped relationships and situations of the
melodrama." </p>
      <p>According to Hauser, the separation of sacred and profane art
took place in the Neolithic age. Profane art, which was restricted to
craft, probably lay entirely in the hands of women. Heroic and Homeric
ages meant a decisive turn towards the social system of monarchy
relying on the personal loyalty of vassals to their lord. A new type of
man appeared on the scene &#8211; the artist with a markedly individual
personality, but economic independence was out of the question. In the
Middle Ages the emphasis was not on the personal genius of the artist
but on the craftsmanship. The impersonal commodity-production dominated
the whole of art. </p>
      <p>The increased demand for works of art in the Renaissance led
to the ascent of the artist from the level of the petty bourgeois
artisan to that of the free intellectual worker. The concept of genius
appears. Shakespeare looked down on the broad masses of the people with
a feeling of superiority and made clear in his dramas the struggle
between the Crown, the middle class and the aristocracy. Gradually the
bourgeoisie took possession of all the instruments of culture. Rousseau
was the first to speak as one of the common people himself. He turned
against reason because he saw in the process of intellectualization
also that of social segregation. </p>
      <p>After the French Revolution artists and writers created their
own standards, and their work brought them into a constant state of
tension and opposition towards the public. Through Byron restlessness
and aimlessness became a plague. The theory of 'l'art pour l'art' gave
expression to romantic opposition to the bourgeois world; that is
before Flaubert and Baudelaire shut themselves in their ivory towers,
and the theory started to reflect a conservative attitude. The
estrangement of the intellectuals from practical affairs was seen as
the belief in the absoluteness of truth and beauty. Bohemians emerged
as caricatures of the intelligentsia. In Russia the intellectual
leadership passed into the hands of the cultural elite and remained
there up to the Bolshevist revolution. Film signifies the attempt to
produce art for the masses and give fulfilment to social romanticism. </p>
