<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most talented postromantic Swedish speaking writer in Finland, whose best-known work is the tragedy <em>Daniel Hjort.</em> 
Wecksell broke down at the age of 24, and lived the rest of his 
life, 45 years, at a mental institution in Lapinlahti. He published only one collection of 
poems before his illness.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Att våga eller icke är det första, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Att lyckas eller inte är det andra, </font><br>
<font size="2">Och deremellan ligger handlingen.</font></b><font size="2">" </font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Almqvist')</font>
</blockquote>
<p>Josef Julius Wecksell was born in Turku, the son of Johan Wecksell,
a hat maker, and Sofia Ulrika Björkelund. His parents were culturally
active &#8211; they spoke French, had a piano, and were interested in
theatre. There was no permanent theatre in Turku, but touring groups
vivited the city. At the age of 12 Wecksell had made his own theatre of
paper dolls. A litte later, he began to try his hand at writing poems,
some of which were religious or had anecdotal or erotic character, and
collected them in booklets. "Vita häften" (White booklet), dated from
1853, was titled <i>Julles Pojkar verser af J.J. Vecksell</i>. He also had black, green and other booklets. When he was sixteen, his play <em>Tre friare</em>
(Three suitors), was performed in Turku and then in Helsinki, and later
in Stockholm. A hundred years later it was adapted into a radio play. </p>
<p>In his youth, Wecksell contributed to<i> Åbo Underrättelser</i> and <i>Åbo Tidningar</i>. He had his own period of Wertherism before concentrating on the history and fate of his own country. Wecksell's early patriotic poems followed the models set by <a href="runeberg.htm">J.L. Runeberg</a>. 
During his 'Sturm-und-Drang' period he read Heine and Schiller, and also wrote a poem to his memory. 
Wecksell's first love was his 12-year old cousin, Ida Fock, who died in 1855. Wecksell devoted to 
her the poem 'Barnet bland grafvarna.' Inspired by Byron, he wrote 'Don Juans avsked från lived', 
in which the hero bids his farewell to the world. His love poems composed for "Helmi" (The pearl) were 
inspired by the beautiful Constance Wilhelmina Lundström, 
who married in 1863 Robert Montgomery.</p>
<p>After graduating from Åbo gynmnasium, Wecksell entered the University of Helsinki in 1858. <a href="akivi.htm">Aleksis Kivi</a>
studied there, too, but Wecksell joined the circle around Walfrid
Alftan, and associated more with artists than writers. His first major
play was <em>Två studenter på runosamling</em> (1859). Before writing<span style="font-style: italic;"> Daniel Hjort</span>, he had finished a tragedy entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Skuggornas hämnd</span> in 1861, but he was not satisfied with it. <br>
</p>
      <p>Although the Russian officials had forbidden student
organizations &#8211; they were considered potentially subversive &#8211; Wecksell
participated in underground meetings. He admired the Italian freedom
fighter Garibaldi, whom he saw as a symbol of constitutional ideals.
Wecksell's poem 'Italienaren' was dedicated to Garibaldi, whose
portrait decorated students' assembly room. Another hero was the
explorer G.A. Wallin, for whom Wecksell wrote a poem starting with the
words: "På öknens slätter i natten / en beduin framfar, / kamelen
vaggar sakta / och himmeln tindrar klar." Shakespeare's works
influenced deeply Wecksell's writing &#8211; he read them in Swedish
translation, published in 1847-1851. </p>

<p>Wecksell's first collection of verse, <em>Valda ungdomsdikter</em> (1860, Selected youthful poems), was unfortunately published in the same year 
as the second part of J.L. Runeberg's highly popular <i>Fänrik Ståls sägner</i>
(1848-1860). However, later the composer Jean Sibelius used Wecksell's
lyrics in several of his songs, among them 'Demanten på marssnön' (The
diamond on the snow in March). When&nbsp;Wecksell had earlier composed
his verses freely, enjoying rhyming, his attitude toward writing became
more serious and professional.&nbsp; From this period came Wecksell's
poem 'Svenskan och Finskan' (Swedish and Finnish), one of the first
texts dealing with language question: the educated elite was Swedish
speaking, whereas the majority of the population spoke Finnish as
their&nbsp;native tongue. </p><p>After
being treated for a veneral disease, Wecksell was declared to be cured,
but his mental strength was fading fast. He worked feverishly with his
most famous drama <i>Daniel Hjort</i>, about good intentions and
dreams crushed by reality. It was first time performed in November 1862
at the New Theatre in Helsinki and published next year with an
introduction by Uno Cygnaeus. In 1864 it was performed in Sweden. Since
then the play had maintained its status as a living classic and the
most significant Finnish drama written in Swedish before Aleksis Kivi's
works paved way for the Finnish-language theatre. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b><font size="2">"Mikään terveysnäytelmä
tämä ei ole. Henkilöiden housuissa on kamala olla. Voidakseen toimia he
tarvitsevat velvoituksen, tiedostetun taustan, aikaisemmin kärsityn
häpeän tai yleensä edesmenneen nöyrytyksen, nykyisten mittapuiden
mukaan melko abstraktin velvotteen, joka antaa heille sysäyksen toimia.
Ja toimintana voi olla yleensä vain kosto tai pako."</font></b><font size="2"> (the director Jouko Turkka on <i>Danel Hjort</i>, 1981) </font></font></blockquote>
<p>The story is set in the Turku Castle in 1599, after the period when
the peasant rebellion in Ostrobothnia, known as the War of the Maces,
was mercilessly stopped by Klaus Fleming. The main characters are
Sigismund, King of Poland, his opponent and nephew Charles, who became
King Charles IX, Admiral Klaus Fleming, supporter of Sigismund, and the
young Daniel Hjort, who must choose his side in the battle of power.
Hjort is a tormented character like Hamlet, his father was beheaded on
Fleming's order but he was brought up in Fleming's family. And like
Hamlet he has spent much of his life in study, but he is a man of
action too. Wecksell depicted him as a representantive of the people &#8211;
against historical knowledge. For love and idealistic reasons, Hjort
becomes the traitor of the sieged castle of Turku. He concludes that
the real moral challenge is to resist oppression, not in slavish
following of power. And as in Shakespeare's plays, most of the central
characters are killed at the end. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">"<b>Have you the courage to venture your heart-strings and blood, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Your joy and your welfare on earth, </font><br>
<font size="2">For truth and for right? Then, laddie good, </font><br>
<font size="2">Step into our circle, with mirth.</font></b><font size="2">" </font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Daniel Hjort</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>After having finished<i> Daniel Hjort</i>, Wecksell was completely
exhausted; he saw hallucinations and he realized how fragile his mental
balance was. However, he was present at the first performance of his
tragedy, where he supposedly said: "It sounds so familiar, but I don't
recall where I read it." For a period he spent in the Endenich asylum
near Cologne. The treatments were unsuccessful. On September 28, 1865,
he entered Lapinlahti mental hospital, on the seashore of Helsinki,
without never returning. One of his fellow patients in 1872 was Aleksis
Kivi. Mental instability ran in&nbsp;Wecksell's family: his two
brothers went insane, one&nbsp;descended into alcoholism, and one was
considered as "extremely peculiar." </p>
<p>Wecksell's other noteworthy writings include poems, which were
composed&nbsp;during the early stage of his illness. In 'Jag midnattens
barn' (1862), included in the collected poems from 1868,&nbsp;the poet
calls himself as the child of the midnight. Some of the fragmentary
texts reflect his agony and fears, when he is facing the approaching
mental collapse. In a poem, probably written in Bonn, he confessed: "On
a cloud you are standing!" But the euphoria of thoughts reaching the
height of God soon disappears and the poet&nbsp;realizes that the cloud
has vanished. Wecksell struggle with schizophrenia took over 40 years.
He died on August 9, 1907, in Helsinki. His&nbsp;work inspired Arvid
Mörne, who published&nbsp;his biography in 1909 and his poetry and
other material in <em>Nya Wecksell-studier</em> (1920).
