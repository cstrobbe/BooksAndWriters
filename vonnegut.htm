<p>
American author noted for his pessimistic and satirical novels. Kurt
Vonnegut Jr.'s best known work is <span class="st"><em>Slaughterhouse-Five,
or The Children's Crusade</em> </span>(1969),
which was based on his experiences in Dresden, Germany, where he was a
prisoner-of-war at the destruction of the town in 1945. Vonnegut used
fantasy and science fiction to examine the horrors and absurdities of
20th century civilization. His constant concern about the effects of
technology on humanity led some critics to consider him a science
fiction writer, but the author himself rejected this label.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>'"You know - we've had to
imagine
the war here, and we have imagined that it was being fought by aging
men like ourselves. We had forgotten that the wars were fought by
babies. When I saw those freshly shaved faces, it was a shock. "My God,
my God&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> " I said to myself, "it's the Children's
Crusade."'</strong> (in <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. was born in Indianapolis. His father, Kurt
Sr., was a architect. In <em>Galápagos</em>
(1985) Vonnegut wrote: "When I got to be sixteen, though, I myself had
arrived at the conclusion my mother and the neighbors had reached so
long ago: that my father was a repellent failure, his work appearing
only in the most disreputable publications, which paid him almost
nothing. He was an insult to life itself, I thought, when he went on
doing nothing with it but writing and smoking all the time&nbsp;&#8211; and I
mean all the time." Vonnegut's mother, Edith Lieber, heiress to a
brewery fortune based on Lieber Lager Beer and the Gold Medal Beer,
committed suicide in 1944. <br>
</p>
<p>For the ten years before World War II Vonnegut's father was
almost constantly unemployed, and anti-German feelings and cultural
prejudices were later seen in Vonnegut's novel <span class="st"><em>Slapstick,
or Lonesome No More!</em> </span>(1976).
Vonnegut himself was proud of his German heritage. When Charles
Lindbergh caused a controversy with his claim, that three groups
are&nbsp;pressing&nbsp;the U.S. toward war, the British, the Jewish and
the Roosevelt Administration, Vonnegut defended him in 1941 in a
column: "The mud-slingers are good. They'd have to be good to get
people hating a loyal and sincere patriot. On second thought, Lindbergh
is no patriot&nbsp;&#8211; to hell with the word, it lost it's [<em>sic</em>]
meaning after the Revolutionary War." <font size="2">(<em>The Cornell
Daily Sun</em>, October 13, 1941) </font></p>
<p>In 1940 Vonnegut started to study biochemistry at Cornell; his
father, who funded his education, had recommend that he should study
chemistry rather that the humanities. Arts were discouraged in the
family. However, Vonnegut also wrote satirical anti-war articles for
the student newspaper <i>Cornell Sun</i>. When Japan attacked Pearl
Harbor, Vonnegut volunteered in 1943 for military service. "Good! They
will teach you to be neat!" his father said. </p>
<p>Vonnegut was sent to Europe, serving there as a battalion
scout with
the 106th Infantry Division. He was taken as a prisoner in the Battle
of the Bulge in December 1944. After being transported to Dresden, an
old cultural town, he worked there making a diet supplement for
pregnant women. Between February 13 and 14 the Royal Air Force and
United States Air Force made heavy raids on Dresden. At that time
Vonnegut was a prisoner in a meat-locker under a slaughterhouse, and
was among the few people to survive the total destruction of the city.
Later he was employed by the Germans to dig out corpses. Dresden was
occupied in 1945 by Soviet troops and Vonnegut was repatriated to the
United States.</p>
<p>After the war Vonnegut studied anthropology at Chicago
University
from 1944 to 1947, but his M.A. thesis 'Fluctuations Between Good and
Evil in Simple Tales' was rejected. However, in 1971 the
anthropological department accepted his novel<em> Cat's Cradle</em>
(1963) in lieu of a thesis and Vonnegut war awarded the degree. In the
book Vonnegut explores destructive rationality of Western science and
the turn towards mysticism, which was just then beginning to take hold
among students in the USA and Europe. In 1945 Vonnegut married a
childhood friend. They had two daughters and a son, and also adopted
the three children of Vonnegut's sister, who died of cancer in 1958. </p>
<p>Vonnegut worked for over three years as a public relations man
for
General Electric's research laboratory. His first science fiction
story, 'Report on the Barnhouse Effect' was published in<i> Collier's
Weekly</i>
in September 1950. After selling also other stories, Vonnegut quit his
"goddam nightmare job", as he described it in a letter to his father,
and moved with his family to Cape Cod (the Cape), Massachusetts.
Between 1950 and 1963 Vonnegut published 45 stories, which appeared in
such publications as <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, <i>Cosmopolitan</i>,
<i>Esquire</i>, and the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>.
"During most of my freelancing," Vonnegut recalled in 1969 in an
interview, "I made what I would have made in charge of the cafeteria at
a pretty good junior-high school." Actually the magazines paid well
for&nbsp;short fiction in the 1950s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vonnegut's stories has
been collected in <span class="st"><em>Canary in a Cathouse</em> </span>(1961),&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Welcome to the Monkey House</em></span> (1968),&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Bagombo Snuff Box</em> </span>(1999), and <em>While
Mortals Sleep</em> (2011). <br>
</p>
<p>While teaching at the Iowa Writers' Workshop between 1965 and
1967, Vonnegut struggled to write about his wartime experiences. His
students included John Casey, James Crumley, John Irving, Suzanne
McConnell, and Jonathan Penner. "Your first job is to hook the reader,"
he emphasized. "Your second is to keep your reader to reading."
Vonnegut helped Irving to finish his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Setting Free the Bears</span> (1968). In
1967, Vonnegut was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship to travel to
Dresden, but the Germans were not eager to recall the war years. </p>
<p>Vonnegut's first novel, <em>Player Piano</em>&nbsp;(1952),
was a
tale of black humour. The story is set in the future, where scientists
and engineers of vast corporations attempt to automate everything. As a
result, the functions of human beings are gradually taken over by
machines. Noteworthy, Vonnegut also prophesied the collapse of the
Soviet Union under the impact of American know-how. This work labelled
Vonnegut as a sciece-fiction writer, although the author himself though
that he had written a novel about people and machines. Noteworthy,<em>
Mother Night</em>,
originally published in paperback in 1961, and republished in 1965 in
hardcover, was a non-sf novel about the "true" identity of a double
agent. </p>
<p>Before his breakthrough novel <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>,
Vonnegut wrote&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>The Sirens of Titan</em></span>
(1959). It featured a character for whom the events of history take
place simultaneously. <i>Cat's Craddle</i>,
his fourth novel, which also gained attention among the broad
readership, was about a scientist, a Nobel laureate named Felix
Hoenikker,&nbsp;who has created&nbsp;a chemical, Ice-Nine, that turns
all water into ice. Absentmindedly he is responsible for the end of the
world. The English writer Douglas Adams, a fan of Vonnegut,&nbsp;took
the comedy of apocalypse a few steps further in <em>The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy</em> (1979), in which Earth is demolished to make
way for a&nbsp;hyperspace&nbsp;bypass.</p>
<p><i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>
combined historical facts and science fiction. At the time of its
publication, and even to this day, it is a rare American novel, that
presented Germans as victims of war. Vonnegut also placed the atrocity
in the larger context of human history. "Thank God I was in Dresden
when it was burned down," Vonnegut once said, meaning he had something
to write about that he had experienced himself. Vonnegut depicts the
Allied firebombing of Dresden, seen through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim,
a kind of descendant of <a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a>'s
Candide.
Billy finds peace of mind after being kidnapped by Tralfamadorians. He
learns that time is not necessarily moving in a liner fashion and that
the secret of life is to live only in the happy moments. Billy lives on
Earth and on the distant planet Tralfamadore, responding to events with
the resignated slogan "So it goes". Paul Kantner and Grace Slick,
members of the rock band Jefferson Airplane, were great fans of the
book. They invited Vonnegut in 1971 to San Francisco, but cooperation
plans were dropped. "The vibrations were just awful, I wanted out as
fast as possible," Vonnegut said later. <br>
 </p>
<p>For roughly twenty years, from 1950 to 1970, Vonnegut led,
much as
his fictional alter ego Kilgore Trout, the anonymous life of a
drugstore-rack writer, who is said to have been modelled on the science
fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon. A novel attributed to Kilgore Trout,
written by Philip José Farmer, was published in 1975 under the title <i>Venus
on the Half-Shell. </i>In 1979 Vonnegut divorced his first wife and
married the photographer Jill Krementz. An innate pessimism, central to
Vonnegut's <i>oeuvre</i>,&nbsp;did
not make the author's later years any easier. In 1984 he made a suicide
attempt. Vonnegut did not specify the culprit responsible for the ills
of the world,&nbsp;but viewed misfortunes as a part of our common
nature or coming by chance. </p>
<p><em>Happy Birthday, Wanda June</em> (1971) was loosely based
on the last book of Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>.&nbsp;The novel
&nbsp;grew from a play, entitled<em> Penelope</em>,
in which Harold Ryan, a big game hunter and male chauvinist, the
"Odysseus", was modelled&nbsp;after Ernest Hemingway.&nbsp;Since&nbsp; <span class="st"><em>Breakfast of Champions, or Goodbye Blue Monday</em></span>
(1973) Vonnegut used self-consciously and mockingly his public
personality as the author-narrator. Robert Altman planned to film the
book in the mid-1950s, Alan Rudolph wrote the script for him, but they
never got it made and lost the right. Eventually Rudolp's adaptation,
in which Bruce Willis played the suicidal Pontiac dealer Dwayne Hoover
and Albert Finney was Kilgore Trout, was released in 1999. The film
failed both critically and commercially. </p>
<p>In <em>Jailbird</em> (1979) and <span class="st"><em>Deadeye
Dick </em></span>(1983)
Vonnegut explored idealized Mid-western middle-class values and the
social and political course of American history in this century.
Vonnegut's commandments for a better world&nbsp;were deceitfully
simple: honor the Sermon of the Mount, stop exploiting and killing
people, be kind to everyone. Sometimes Vonnegut turned against his
radical&nbsp;reputation and&nbsp;made chauvinist statements: "Educating
a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch:
everything stops."&nbsp; </p>
<p>Vonnegut's&nbsp;later novels received mixed reviews and he was
accused of recycling essentially the same ideas. "And what is
literature, Rabo," he argued on the art of writing in&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Bluebeard</em></span>
(1987), "but an insider's newsletters about affairs relating to
molecules, of no importance to anything in the Universe but a few
molecules who have the disease called 'thought.'" <em>Hocus Pocus</em>
(1990), the author's thirteenth novel, was set in the years following
the defeat of the Vietnam war. With&nbsp;<em><span class="st">Timequake</span>
</em>(1997)
Vonnegut struggled for ten years. Instead of throwing it away, the
author published it with fragments of autobiography. The novel was
again about Kilgore Trout, thrown into a world set back ten years, from
February 13, 2001 to February 17, 1991. Inside the story Vonnegut makes
comments on all kinds of matters between heaven and earth. </p>
<p>Vonnegut's other works include plays, essays, critics, and TV
plays. Although Vonnegut announced that <i>Timequake</i> would be his
last book, he started again another novel, <em>If God Were Alive Today</em>,
about a stand-up comedian. His essays, written after <i>Timequake</i>,
Vonnegut collected in&nbsp;<em>A Man Without a Country</em>&nbsp;
(2005). On January 2000 Vonnegut was hospitalized for smoke inhalation
after a fire at his home. Vonnegut had tried to extinguish the flames
with a blanket. The fire broke out on the top floor of his townhouse at
East 48th Street where he reportedly had been watching the Super Bowl
in his study. Kurt Vonnegut died on April 11, 2007, in Manhattan, New
York, after suffering irreversible brain injuries as a result of a fall
at his home. </p>
