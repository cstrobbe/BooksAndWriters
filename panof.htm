      <p>German-American art historian and essayist, whose famous books
include <i>The Life and Art of Albrecht Dürer</i> (1943) and <i>Studies
in Iconology </i>(1939). Panofsky defined an artist as "one who is
full of images." He was especially concerned with the iconography of
the various periods he studied and interpreted works through the
themes, symbols, and ideas inherent in the history of art.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As I have said before, no one can
be blamed for enjoying works of art "naïvely"&nbsp;&#8211; &nbsp;for
appraising and interpreting them according to his lights and not caring
any further. But the humanist will look with suspicion upon what might
be called "appreciationism." He who teaches innocent people to
understand art without bothering about classical languages, boresome
historical methods and dusty old documents, deprives naïveté of its
charm without correcting its errors."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Meaning in the Visual Arts</font></i><font size="2">, 1955) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Erwin Panofsky was born in Hanover, the son of Arnold
Panofsky, a successful businessman, and Caecilie (Solling) Panofsky. He
studied at the universities of Berlin, Munich, and Freiburg/Breslau,
receiving his Ph.D. in 1914 from the University of Freiburg. In 1916 he
married his fellow student Dora Mosse. They first met at an art history
seminar conducted in Berlin by Professor Adolph Goldschmidt.&nbsp; Dora
was the daughter of the prominent Prussian jurist Albert Mosse, who had
reached the highest level of judical seniority possible for a Jew at
the time. </p>
      <p>The Panofskys traveled a great deal and took their two sons to
long museum tours, hoping to spark also their interest in art. "There
is probably no surer way to divert your children's interest from art to
"plumbing"", recalled Panofsky's son Wolfgang, who later became
Professor of Physics at Stanford. In <em>Panofsky on Physics,
Politics, and Peace</em> (2007), he gives a loving portrait of his
father, who taught his son to play chess at the age of four, and ceased
playing when he started winning. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Panofsky was employed by the Warburg Library before the famed
collections were moved to London. In 1924 appeared his early major
work, <i>"Idea": Ein Beitrag zur Begriffsgeschichte der älteren
Kunstheorie</i>, which dealt with the history of the neoplatonic theory
of art. Panofsky's career in art history took him to the universities
of Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg, where he taught from 1920 to 1933. He
also was involved in arranging chamber music concerts. During this
period Panofsky began to develop the "iconological" approach to art
history in his lectures and publications &#8211; iconography meant for him
the mere identification of subject matter in art. His colleague at both
the University of Hamburg and the Warburg Instiute was <a href="cassir.htm">Ernst Cassirer</a>, a neo-Kantian like Panofsky
himself. Panofsky attended his fellow professor's lectures frequently
over the years. </p>
      <p>What was new in Panofsky's approach was his concern with
content when the discipline of art history was dominated by
preoccupation with form and stylistic analysis. <a href="wolfflin.htm">Heinrich
Wölfflin</a> and Alois Riegl were two notable exponents of this method.
From early on, Panofsky criticized Wölfflin's separation of form and
content. The usefulness of Wölfflin's famous five categories of visual
representation he did not doubt, though it was Riegl's terminology that
he favored in&nbsp;his own work. His own five pairs of oppositions
Panofsky gave in the article 'Über das Verhältnis der Kunstgeschichte
zur Kunsttheorie' (On the relationship between art history and art
theory), published in <em>Zeitschrift für Ästetik und allgemeine
Kunstwissenschaft</em> (1924-25). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2">Panofsky's iconological interpretation
is not far from <a href="rbarthes.htm">Roland Barthes</a>'s later
semiological system, in which the basic terms are sign, signifier, and
signified. "And here is now another example: I am at the barber's, and
a copy of <i>Paris-Match</i> is offered to me. On the cover, a young
Negro in a French uniform is saluting, with his eyes uplifted, probably
fixed on a fold of the tricolour. All this is the <i>meaning</i> of
the picture. But, whether naively or not, I see very well what it
signifies to me: that France is a great Empire, that all her sons,
without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag... I
am therefore again faced with a greater semiological system: there is a
signifier, itself already formed with a previous system (<i>a black
soldier is giving the French salute</i>); there is a signified (it is
here purposeful mixture of Frenchness and militariness); finally, there
is a presence of the signified through the signifier." (from </font><i><font size="2">Mythologies</font></i><font size="2">, 1973) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Panofsky first visited the United States in 1931 upon the
invitation of New York University. He was permitted to spend alternate
terms in Hamburg and New York, but after the Nazis came to power and
ousted all Jewish officials, he was forced to leave Germany. Hamburg
was one of the last German cities to yield to the Nazi demands. The
faculty of the university, which was compelled to vote for his
dismissal, expressed regrets in private. The wind section of the
Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra held a&nbsp;goodbye performance in their
house. During WWII, the city was practically destroyed by Allied
bombings. </p>
      <p>Panofsky held for a year concurrent lectureships at New York
and Princeton universities, and in 1935 he was invited to join the
newly constituted humanistic faculty of the Institute for Advanced
Study, Princeton. When the German German philologist and literary
historian <a href="auerb.htm">Erich Auerbach</a> had to leave
Pennsylvania State University due to insurance problems, Panofsky
helped him to find a temporary refuge in Princeton. After Dora's death
in 1965, Panofsky married Gerda Soergel. Panofsky taught at Princeton
till his death on March 14, 1968. He was a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, the British Academy, and a number of
other foreign academies. In 1962 he received the Haskins Medal of the
Mediaeval Academy of America. </p>
      <p>Most of Panofsky's later books were written in English. <i>Studies
in Iconology</i> was based on the Mary Flexner Lectures at Bryn Mawr
College. The Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard were published as
      <i>Early Netherlandish Painting</i> (1953). Among his other major
contributions to art history are <i>Pandora's Box</i><i> </i>(1956),
written with his first wife Dora Mosse Panofsky, and<i> </i><i>Renaissance
and Renascences in Western Art</i> (1960). <i>Abbot Suger on the Abbey
Church of St. Denis and Its Art Treasures </i>(1946) made available
Abbot Suger's account of his rebuilding of the royal abbey outside
Paris. </p>
      <p>Panofsky's&nbsp;<em>Hercules am Scheidewege und andere antike
Bildstoffe in der neueren Kunst</em> (1930) first&nbsp;presented his
iconological&nbsp;approach, but as a method it was not systematized
until 1939.&nbsp;<i>Studies in Iconology</i> drew the basic distinction
between iconography, which concerns itself with the subject matter or
meaning of works of art, and the study of their intrinsic meanings,
iconology. To clarify his idea Panofsky gave an example: when an
acquaintance greets one on the street by lifting his hat, from a formal
point of view there is nothing but color, lines and volumes in sight.
The world of pure forms carries primary or natural meanings, artistic
motifs. </p>
      <p>But the lifting of the hat forms a salute peculiar to the
Western world, dating back to mediaeval times. One interprets the
gesture as a polite greeting. Iconographical analysis deals with the
manner in which, under varying historical conditions, specific themes
of concepts are expressed by objects and events. In iconological
analysis the equipment for interpretation is synthetic intuition,
familiarity with the essential tendencies of the human mind,
conditioned by personal psychology and world view. Thus a simple,
polite greeting can reveal an experienced observer straits of
personality, national, social and educational background, an individual
manner of reacting to the world. This intrinsic meaning or content "is
apprehended by ascertaining those underlying principles which reveal
the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or
philosophical persuasion &#8211; qualified by one personality and condensed
into one work." </p>
      <p>The French sociologist and philosopher Pierre Bourdieu has
criticized Panofsky's method to write on Suger and the "invention" of
Gothic architecture almost only from the point of view of the
interpreter: "To treat a work of plastic as as a discourse intended to
be interpreted, decoded, by reference to a transcendent code analogous
to the Saussarian "<i>langue</i>" is to forget that artistic production
is always <i>also </i>&#8211; to different degrees depending on the art and
on the historically variable styles of practicing it &#8211; the product of
an "art", "pure practice without theory", as Durkheim says, or to put
it another way, a <i>mimesis</i>, a sort of symbolic gymnastics, like
the rite or the dance; and is also to forget that the work of art
always contains something ineffable, not by excess, as hagiography
would have it, but by default, something which communicates, so to
speak, from body to body, i.c. on the hither side of words or concepts,
and which pleases (or displeases) without concepts." <font size="2">(<a href="bourd.htm">Pierre Bourdieu</a> in </font><i><font size="2">Outline
of a Theory of Practice</font></i><font size="2">, 1972) </font></p>
      <p><i>Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism</i> (1951) were based
on Panofsky's 1948 Wimmer lecture. He tried to show convincingly, how
architectural style and structure provided visible and tangible
equivalents to the scholastic definitions of the order and form of
thought. Thomas Aquinas's <i>Summa Theologiae</i> and other great
treatises were organized so that the reader is led, step by step, from
one proposition to the other and is always kept informed as to the
progress of this process. But also the composition of a High Gothic
portal tended to be subjected to a strict and fairly standardized
scheme which simultaneously clarifies the narrative content. Panofsky
notes that the Scholastics and builders of the cathedrals respected and
accepted authorities. "Of two apparently contradictory motifs, both of
them sanctioned by authority, one could not simply be rejected in favor
of the other. They had to be worked through to the limit and they had
to be reconciled in the end: much as a saying of St. Augustine had
ultimately to be reconciled with one of St. Ambrose." </p>
      <p>Besides art history Panofsky wrote on Mozart, the history of
detective novel, and the cinema. His essay on the style and medium in
the motion pictures, which originally appeared in <i>Bulletin of the
Department of Art and Archaeology </i>(1934), is considered among the
most influential examinations of the subject. Panofsky saw his first
films in the silent era when often a pianist accompanied the events on
the screen with music. "It was not an artistic urge that gave rise to
the discovery and gradual perfection of a new technique; it was a
technical invention that gave rise to the discovery and gradual
perfection of a new art." These early experiences perhaps explain his
view that "a moving picture, even when it has learned to talk, remains
a picture that moves..." Due to this special nature of the film art,
Shavian witty dialogue can sometimes fall, according to Panofsky, a
little flat. A sensitive spectator can find even Groucho Marx's
wise-cracks out of place, when they lose contact with the "visible
moment." Panofsky compares the making of a film to the building of a
cathedral &#8211; they both are collective efforts. The role of the director
corresponds to that of the architect in chief; and the contributions of
actors, cameramen, sound men, the whole technical staff, can be
compared to that of sculptors, glass painters, carpenters and so forth.
