      <p>Playwright, poet, master of the classical French tragedy in
the times of<a href="moliere.htm"> Moliére</a>
and Corneille. Racine took his subjects from antiquity or mythology and
became very popular with his plays on blind, passionate love. His
dramas followed the neoclassical tragic form; they had five acts and
the dramatic time of the action did not exceed one day. Usually the
action was restricted to one place. In a number of political or
aesthetic debates, Racine has been praised over Shakespeare. <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Great crimes grow out of small
ones. If
today / A man first oversteps the bounds, he may / Abuse in time all
laws and sanctities: / For crime, like virtue, ripens by degrees; / but
when has one seen innocence, in a trice, / So change as to embrace the
ways of vice? "</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Phèdre</font></i><font size="2">, 1677) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Jean Racine was born in La Ferté-Milon, a small town near
Soissons.
His family belonged to the upper bourgeoisie. After the death of his
mother and father, he was raised by his grandparents. They were
converted to Jansenists, a sect that emphasized severely controlled
conduct, denied free will and stressed the necessity of grace for
salvation. Pope Urban VIII condemned the movement in the 1641 Papal
Bull. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Racine was educated at the Catholic school at Port-Royal, a
centre
of religious thought and learning, where his grandmother had retired.
At the age of 19, he entered the Collège de Harcourtin in Paris. During
this period he became friends with Moliére, the fabulist La Fontaine,
and the poet-critic Boileau. Racine's lost first play,&nbsp;<em>Amasie</em>
(1660), was accepted by the Marais Theatre but never performed. Because
theatre was considered at that time immoral, Racine found himself in
conflict with his family. He was forced to leave Paris, and his family
tried to get him interested in the career of a priest. However, after a
period of seclusion in Provence, he returned to Paris and the theatre
world. Racine's early tragedy<i> Les Amours d'Ovide</i> (1661) has been
lost.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><i>The Thebans, or The Enemy Brothers</i>
(1664) was staged by Moliére's company. The word "blood", mostly on a
metaphoric level,&nbsp;appears more frequently than any other word
in&nbsp;any of his other plays. "Let the mob love or loathe us at their
choice; Blood sets us on the throne, not their blind voice," says
Polynices, one of the characters. "Bloodf will exercise its wonted
sway,"&nbsp;prophecies Creon. Racine's first chef-d'oeuvre, <i>Alexander
the Great </i>(1665),
was performed by the rival company at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. This work
alienated him from Moliére, who never spoke to him again, but marked
the beginning of his ruthless
promoting of his own career and his artistic triumphs. Moliére never
spoke to him again. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Following the success of his dramas, Racine
challenged Corneille's position as the leading tragedian of the age. He
sniped at Corneille in the prefaces to the printed editions of his
plays, referring to "a certain malicious old poet".
During the production of <em>Andromaque</em> (1667) for Moliére's
theatre, the star actress Mlle. Duparc chose Racine and became his
mistress. She died in 1688. In the 1680s Racine's mistress was the
actress La Champmeslé, who was his leading lady from Berenice. </p>
      <p>In the mid-1660's Racine made his break with the Jansenists.
Among his following plays were <em>Les Plaideurs</em> (1668, The
Litigants), <em>Bérénice</em> (1670), <em>Bajazet</em> (1672),&nbsp;<em>Mithridate</em>
(1673, Mithridates), <em>Iphigénie</em> (1674, Iphigenia), and&nbsp;<em>Phèdre</em>
(1677, Phaedra), the last two being inspired by Euripides, whom Racine
most admired. Of Racine's tragedies, only <i>Bajazet</i> had a
contemporary setting; <i>The Litigants</i>, a comedy partly based on
Aristophanes' <i>Sphekes</i> (The Wasps), was set in the 17th century.
      <i>Phaedra</i>,
Racine's masterpiece, was his last for the professional theatre.
Unfortunately, Cardinal Mazarin's niece Nicolas Pradon had written a
play of the same nime, and it was praised by critics. Racine was a
master of Alexandrine verse, but he sketched his plays first in prose
and then turned it into verse, using conventional vocabulary, less than
2000 words. </p>
      <p>The chief source for <i>Andromaque</i> was a passage from the
third book of the <i>Aeneid</i>,
but Racine made many changes. Andromache is the widow of Hector.
Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, has brought her captive from Troy. Another
great woman character is Hermione, who has come to the court of Epirus
to marry Pyrrhus. In one of the great scenes of the play, the desperate
Hermione says to the king, who loves the unresponsive Andromaque: "I
loved you faithless; had you been faithful, how much more could I have
loved you? Even now, Hearing you speak the calm, cold words which kill
my hopes, it may be that I love you still." </p>
      <p><i>Phaedra</i> was partly based on Euripides' <i>Hippolytys</i>.
Phaedra loves her stepson, Hippolytys, and confesses her love to him
when she wrongly assumes that her husband Theseus, the heroic King of
Athens, is dead. "Shall Theseus' widow dare to love his son? No, such a
monster is too vile to spare. Here is my heart. Your blade must pierce
me there." Theseus returns home and hears from his wife's nurse that
Hippolytus has attempted to seduce Phaedra. Hippolytus wants to seek
his own heroism, telling his father: "Let me at long last show my
courage." He loves the princess Aricia and protects her step-mother's
honor. Theseus curses his son who is killed by Neptune's power. Phaedra
confesses all and poisons herself <font face="Symbol">-</font> "Death
dims my eyes, which soiled what they could see, Restoring to the light
its purity." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"THÉSÉE: Ah! qu'est-ce que
j'entends? Un traître, un téméraire</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Préparait cet outrage á l'honneur de son père, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Avec quelle rigueur, destin, tu me poursuis: </font><br>
        <font size="2">Je ne sais où je vais, je ne sais où je suis. </font><br>
        <font size="2">O tendresse! ô bonte trop mal récompensée! </font><br>
        <font size="2">Projets audacieux! détestable pensée! </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Phèdre</font></i><font size="2">, 1677) </font></blockquote>
      <p>At the age of thirty-three, Racine was elected to the Académie
Française. After <i>Phaedra </i>was
ridiculed in a sonnet, Racine decided to change his life. Never happy
at the distress that his career caused his family, Racine cut all links
with the commercial stage, and reconciled with the Jansenists at
Port-Royal. He married a pious young woman, Catherine de Romanet; they
had two sons and five daughters. Most of the children became nuns or
priests. Racine's wife never went to theatre. It has been claimed that
she never even read any of Racine's plays. </p>
      <p>Racine remained in the country but also made short trips to
Paris.
He was appointed Royal Historiographer with Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux
(1636-1711), a writer and critic. As royal historian, Racine
accompanied the King on his military campaigns and recorded his
exploits. He received a salary of 145,000 francs over a period of ten
years. However, the King was not aware about the artistic significance
of his favorite. When Boileau once remarked that Moliére was the
greatest writer of the century, he replied: "But I never knew that." <br>
      </p>
      <p>Racine's last plays,&nbsp;<em>Esther </em>(1689), first
performed by pupils of St. Cyr, and&nbsp;<em>Athalie</em> (1691), were
commissioned by King Louis XIV's wife, Mme de Maintenon.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Athalie</span>, in which the heretical
queen Athaliah is crushed by the unrelenting God of Israel, was imbued
with Jansenist theology. To the end, Athaliah remains unrepentant and
wins the sympathy of the audience. Voltaire called the tragedy "the
work which closest approaches perfection by a mortal man". <i>Esther</i>
was a great success but eventually Mme. de Maintenon banished plays
from St. Cyr, her charitable foundation for young ladies. Racine died
on April 21, 1699 from cancer of the liver, and was buried at
Port-Royal. Later his remains were transferred to Saint-Étienne-du-Mont
in Paris and reburied next to Pascal. </p>
