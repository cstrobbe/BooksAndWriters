<P>Poet, translator, essayist, and lecturer, influenced by French <A href="abreton.htm">Surrealism </A>and <A href="mallarme.htm">Symbolism</A>. Celan was born in Romania, he lived in France, and wrote in German. His parents were killed in the Holocaust; the author himself escaped death by working in a Nazi labor camp. "Death is a Master from Germany", Celan's most quoted words, translated into English in different ways, are from the poem 'Todesfuge' (Death Fugue). </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT size=2>"A poem, as a manifestation of language and thus essentially dialogue, can be a message in a bottle, sent out in the – not always greatly hopeful – belief that somewhere and sometime it could was up on land, on heartland perhaps. Poems in this sense, too, are under way: they are making toward something." </FONT></B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Paul Celan was born Paul Antschel, the only child of German-speaking Jewish parents in Cernauti, in Bukovina, a part of northern Romania 
(earlier Czernowitz in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now Chernovtsy, Ukraine). 
Bukovina held speakers of Ukrainian, Romanian, German, Swabian, and Yiddish. It was relatively free from religious discrimination; nearly half of the inhabitants of Czernowitz were Jews – the city was called "Little Vienna." Celan's parents spoke German at home and with his mother, Fritzi, Celan shared a passion for German poetry; especially the influence of the Romantic tradition from Novalis to Rilke is seen in his early verse. At the age of six, Celan entered a liberal, German-language elementary school and he was then sent to a Hebrew school, the Safah Ivriah. After his bar mitzvah in 1933, Celan joined an anti-Fascist youth group, which published a mimeographed Marxist magazine called <I>Red Student</I>. </P>
<P>Celan studied medicine in Paris in 1938 and then Romance 
philology at the University of Czernowitz. The Russians invaded Bukovina in 1940 and two years later the Nazis started to deport Jews to labor camps. His parents refused to go into hiding and they were taken to
death camps, where they died afterward. According to some sources, 
Celan's father died of typhus and his mother was killed by a shot in the 
back of the neck. During World War II Celan, 
a Jew, was sent to a forced-labour camp, where he worked until heavy snow
forced it to close. Celan managed to survive the Holocaust, although he was imprisoned 
until 1943. </P>

<P>When the Russian Army reinvaded his homeland in 1944, Celan went
to Bucharest, where he continued reading such great German lyric poets
as Georg Trakl and Rainer Maria Rilke. A year after receiving the news of his parent's deaths, Celan wrote: ''And can you bear, Mother, as once on a time, / the gentle, the German, the pain-laden rhyme?'' Celan had lost his mother, and his German mother tongue, the <I>Muttersprache</I>, reminded him of the loss constantly. Like many Central European Jews, Celan had viewed Germany as a nation of writers and thinkers. </P>
<P>Celan changed his name to Paul Aurel, 
then to Paul Ancel, and finally to Paul Celan. In Bucharest he worked as a translators 
and editor at an publishing company. In 1947 he went to Vienna and 
immigrated next year to Paris, where he became a teacher of German language 
at the Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. In 1952 Celan married 
the graphic artist Gis&egrave;le Lestrange, a non-Jew. They had met in Paris in 1951 and during the following 
19 years they wrote over 700 letters. The correspondence, edited by their son Eric Celan, was published in 
2002. Celan's and <A href="ibach.htm">Ingeborg Bachmann</A>'s&nbsp;<EM>Poetische Korrespondenzen&nbsp;</EM>came out&nbsp;in 1997. Gis&egrave;le 
Celan-Lestrange knew about their love affair, but although it caused her much pain, she eventually accepted it. Celan's Vienna poems mostly address Bachmann. At that time she was writing a dissertation on Heidegger. <SPAN class=st><SPAN class=ft>Throughout her life,&nbsp;Bachmann evoked&nbsp; the&nbsp;figure of Celan, in both her fiction and non-fiction. </SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P>Celan established his reputation first in West Germany. His first 
poems started to appear in the periodicals in the late 1940s. His second 
book, <EM>Mohn und Ged&auml;chtnis </EM>(1952, Poppy and Memories), which included <I>Todesfugue</I>, gained wide acclaim and made 
the author as an important poet of the Holocaust. </P>
<P><I>Todesfugue</I>, Celan's most famous poem, describes with nightmarish, surrealistic images the Jewish 
experience under Nazism. It begins with the lines (tr. by Jerome Rothenberg) ''Black milk of morning we drink at you at dusktime / we drink you at noontime and dawntime we drink you at night / we drink and drink / we scoop out a grave in the sky where it's roomy to lie /' (Schwarze Milch der Fr&uuml;he wir trinken sie abends / wir trinken sie mittags und morgens wir trinken sic nachts...) </P>

(from 'A Death Fugue') </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Celan's friends Ren&eacute; Char, <A href="nsachs.htm">Nelly Sachs</A>, and 
other poets felt the restrictions placed on them by their identity, the "death-bringing speech", and 
by the history that the Holocaust represented. As Celan 
once said, language must be 
set free from the history. "I went with my very being toward language," he once said. In the 1950s Celan's work was becoming known for its broken syntax
and radical minimalism, expressing his perception of the shattered world in
which he lived. Celan concentrated on transformg silence into words, or circumscribe its boundaries. When he received the Bremen Prize for German literature he explained: "Only one thing remained reachable, close and secure amid all losses: language. Yes, language. In spite of everything, it remained secure against loss. But it had to go through its own lack of answers, through terrifying silence, through the thousand darknesses of murderous speech. It went through."<B><FONT size=2></FONT></B><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;<EM>Die Niemandsrose</EM> (1963) marked Celan's return to the theme of the meaningless of human suffering, in which the "clubfoot of the gods" stumbles over mountains of corpses. <I><FONT size=2></FONT></I></P>

<P>When Claire Goll, whom was married to the poet Yvan
Goll's, accused Celan of plagiarizing some of his husband's work,
Celan suffered a nervous breakdown. He had translated some of Goll's poems but the accusations lived from the 1950s to 1960s. He had also translated 
works from such writers as <A href="cocteau.htm">Cocteau</A>, Michaux, 
<A href="mandelst.htm">Mandelstam</A>, Ungaretti, Pessoa, Rimbaud, 
Val&eacute;ry, Char, du Bouchet, and Dupin. In 1960 Celan received Georg B&uuml;chner Prize. He suffered from bouts of
depression throughout the 1960s. "Celan is sick – hopelessly," said the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, who met the poet in 1967. Heidegger had joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and after the war he was forbidden to teach for some years. He never openly apologized his past. Celan had studied thoroughly Heidegger's major work, <I>Being and Time</I> (1927) and in 1957 he had wanted to send him the poem 'Schlieren'. Heidegger had followed Celan's work since the 1950s and had long wished to meet him. After reading at Freiburg University Celan visited Heidegger's famous cabin in Todtnauberg, but what they talked about is unknown. Celan's entry in the logbook was ambiguous: "Into the cabin logbook, with a view toward the Brunnenstern, with hope of a coming word in the heart." However, Celan left Freiburg in high spirits, and wrote the poem 'Todtnauberg' with the lines: "a hope, today, / of a thinking man's / coming (un- / tarryingly coming) / word / in the heart." </P>
<P>Celan's relation to Judaism was complicated. He drew from the heritage of European Symbolism, but his work was rooted in the Jewish-Hasidic tradition, he often brought Jewish themes into his work, and he wrote also in Hebrew some ''pained scrawlings'', apparently during a month-long psychiatric stay in 1965. A year before his death, Celan visited Israel, where he met Ilana Shmueli, his childhood friend and last great love. Celan died by his own hand: he drowned himself in Seine 
on May 1, in 1970, at the age of 49. In his pocket calendar he had written: "Depart Paul." Before his death Heidegger had planned to guide him through the H&ouml;lderlin landscape of the Upper Danube. The three books Celan left unfinished at his death appeared in 1986 under the title <I>Last Poems </I></P>
