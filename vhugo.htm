<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Novelist, poet, and
dramatist, the
most important
of French Romantic writers. Victor Hugo developed his own version of
the historical novel, combining concrete, historical details with
vivid, melodramatic, even feverish imagination. His best-known works
include <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame </i>(1831) and <i>Les
Misérables</i> (1862). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"How came it that this prudent,
economical man was also generous? That this chaste adolescent, this
model father, grew to be, in his last years, an ageing faun? That this
legitimist changed, first into a Bonapartist, only, later still, to be
hailed as the grandfather of the Republic? That this pacifist could
sing, better than anybody, of the glories of the flags of Wagram? That
this bourgeois in the eyes of other bourgeois came to assume the
stature of a rebel? These are the questions that every biographer of
Victor Hugo must answer."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Olympio:
The Life of Victor Hugo</font></i><font size="2"> by André Maurois,
1954) </font></blockquote>
<p>Victor-Marie Hugo was born in Besançon, the son of
Joseph-Léopold-Sigisbert Hugo and Sophie Trébuchet. Hugo's father was
an officer in Napoleon's army, an enthusiastic republican and ruthless
professional soldier, who loved dangers and adventures. After the
marriage of his parents had collapsed, Hugo was raised by his mother.
In 1807 Sophie took her family for two years from Paris to Italy, where
Léopold served as a governor of a province near Naples. When General
Hugo took charge of three Spanish provinces, Sophie again joined her
husband. Sophie's lover, General Victor Lahorie, her husband's former
Commandin Officer, was shot in 1812 by a firing-squad for plotting
against Napoleon. </p>
<p>From 1815 to 1818 Hugo spend in the Pension Cordier in Paris,
but most of the classes of the school were held at the Collège Louis-le
Grand. He began in early adolescence to write verse tragedies and
poetry, and translated <a href="virgil.htm">Virgil</a>. At the age of
sixteen he noted: "Many a great poet is often / Nothing but a literary
giraffe: / How great he seems in front, / How small he is behind!" With
his brothers he founded in 1819 a review, the <i>Conservateur
Littéraire</i>. Inspired by the example of the statesman and author
François René Chateaubriand, Hugo published his first collection of
poems,&nbsp;<em>Odes et poésies diverses</em> (1822). It gained him a
royal pension from Louis XVIII. As a novelist Hugo made his debut with <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Han d'Islande</em><strong> </strong></span></span>(1823),
which appeared first anonymously in four pocket-sized volumes. It was
translated two years later in English and a Norwegian translation was
published in 1831. The style of Sir <a href="wscott.htm">Walter Scott</a>
labelled several of his works, among them <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Bug-Jargal</em>&nbsp;</span></span> (1826), about
friendship between an enslaved African prince and a French military
officer. </p>
<p>In 1822 Hugo married Adèle Foucher (d. 1868), who was the
daughter of an officer at the ministry of war. His brother Eugéne, who
had mental problems, was secretly in love with her and lost his mind on
Hugo's wedding day. Engéne spent the rest of his life in an
institution. In the 1820s Hugo come in touch with liberal writers, but
his political stand wavered from side to side. He wrote royalist odes,
cursed the memory of Napoleon, but then started to defend his father's
role in Napoleon's victories, and attack the injustices of the
monarchist regime. General Hugo died in 1828; at that time Hugo started
to call himself a baron. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>To rise at six, to dine at ten, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">To sup at six, to sleep at ten, </font><br>
<font size="2">Makes a man live for ten times ten. </font></b><br>
<font size="2">(Inscription over the door of Hugo's study) </font></blockquote>
<p>Hugo's foreword for his play <em>Cromwell</em>&nbsp;(1829),
a manifesto for a new drama, started a debate between French Classicism
and Romanticism. However, Hugo was not a rebel, and not directly
involved in the campaign against the bourgeois, but he influenced
deeply the Romantic movement and the formulation of its values in
France. "The Victor I loved is no more," said Alfred de Vigny, "... now
he likes to make saucy remarks and is turning into a liberal, which
does not suit him..." Hugo gained a wider fame with his play <em>Hernani</em>
(1830), in which two lovers poison each other. Of all of Hugo's dramas,
<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Le roi s'amuse</em><strong>
</strong></span></span>(1832), on which Verdi based his opera <i>Rigoletto</i>,
and <em>Ryu Blas</em>&nbsp;(1838) have been the most popular among
filmmakers. </p>
<p>Hugo's historical work <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> was an
instant success. Since its appearance the story has became part of the
popular culture. The novel, set in 15th century Paris, tells a moving
story of a gypsy girl Esmeralda and the deformed, deaf bell-ringer,
Quasimodo, who loves her. Esmeralda aroses passion in Claude Frollo, an
evil priest, who discovers that she favors Captain Phoebus. Frollo
stabs the captain and Esmeralda is accused of the crime. Quasimodo
attempts to shelter Esmeralda in the cathedral. Frollo finds her and
when Frollo is rejected by Esmeralda, he leaves her to the
executioners. In his despair Quasimodo catches the priest, throws him
from the cathedral tower, and disappears. Later two skeletons are found
in Esmeralda's tomb &#8211; that of a hunchback embracing that of a woman. In
1831 Hugo also wrote the libretto for Louise Bertin's <i>Esmeralda</i>,
an opera based on the novel. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Où sont-ils, les marins sombrés

<font size="2">Et c'est ce qui vous fait ces voix désespérées </font><br>
<font size="2">Que vous avez le soir quand vous venez vers
nous! </font></b><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Oceano nox') </font></blockquote>
<p>In the 1830s Hugo published several volumes of lyric poetry,
which were inspired by Juliette Drouet (Julienne-Joséphine Gauvain), an
actress with whom Hugo had a liaison until her death in 1882.
Possibly&nbsp;Mlle Juliette taught him the actress's proverb, "A woman
who has one lover is an angel, a woman who has two lovers is a monster,
and a woman who has three lovers is a woman." Hugo, himself,&nbsp;was
never a faithful lover. Adéle had an affair with Hugo's friend
Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve. "Let us not bury our friendship," Hugo
wrote to him, but later described him as a man, who 'lifts his
loathsome skirt and says, "Admire me!"' Hugo himself was seen by his
fans a Gargantuan, larger-than-life character, and rumors spread that
he could eat half an ox at a single sitting, fast for three days, and
work non-stop for a week. </p>
<p>Hugo's lyrical style was rich, intense and full of powerful
sounds and rhythms, and although it followed the bourgeois popular
taste of the period it also had bitter personal tones. Hugo's 'Mme
Biard poems' &#8211; he had an affair with Léonie d'Aunet (Mme Biard's maiden
name) in the 1840s &#8211; are intensely sexual. According to Verlaine a
typical Hugo love poem was "I like you. You yield to me. I love you. &#8211;
You resist me. Clear off..." </p>
<p>In his later life Hugo became involved in politics as a
supporter of the republican form of government. After three
unsuccessful attempts, Hugo was elected in 1841 to the Académie
Francaise. This triumph was shadowed by the death of Hugo's daughter
Léopoldine. She had married Charles Vacquerie in February 1843, and in
September she drowned with her husband. In a poem, 'Tomorrow, At
Daybreak', written on the fourth anniversary of her death, Hugo
depicted his walk to the place where she was buried: "I shall not look
on the gold of evening falling / Nor on the sails descending distant
towards Harfleur, / And when I come, shall lay upon your grave / A
bouquet of green holly and of flowering briar." It took a decade before
Hugo published again books. After he was made a <i>pair
de France</i> in 1845, he sat in the Upper Chamber among the lords. He
also began to work with a new novel, first titled <i>Jean Tréjean</i>,
then <i>Les Misères</i>. Following the 1848 revolution, with the
formation of the Second Republic, Hugo was elected to the
Constitutional Assembly and to the Legislative Assembly. When workers
started to riot, he led soldiers who stormed barricades in brutal
assaults. </p>
<p>When the coup d'état by Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) took
place in 1851, Hugo
believed his life to be in danger. "Louis-Napoléon is a traitor," he
had declared. "He had violated the Constitution!" Hugo fled to Brussels
and then to Jersey. When he was expelled from the island, he moved with
his family to Guernsey in the English Channel. In a poem, 'Memory of
the Night of the Fourth,' focusing on the overthrown of the Second
Republic and the death of a young child, killed by bullets, Hugo wrote
about the new emperor: "Ah mother, you don't understand politics. /
Monsieur Napoleon, that's his real name, / Is poor and a prince; loves
palaces; / Likes to have horses, valets, money / For his gaming, his
table, his bedroom, / His hunts, and he maintains / Family, church and
society, / He wants Saint-Clod, rose-carpeted in summer, So prefects
and mayors can respect him. That's why it has to be this way: old
grandmothers / With their poor gray fingers shaking with age / Must sew
in winding-sheets children of seven." Hugo's partly voluntary exile
lasted 20 years. During this time he wrote at Hauteville House some his
best works, including&nbsp;<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Les
Châtiments</em> (1853, Castigations) </span></span>&nbsp;and <i>Les
Misérables </i>(1862), an epic story about social injustice. <i>Les
Châtiments </i>became one of the most popular forbidden poetry books. </p>
<blockquote><i>Les Misérables</i> is set in the Parisian
underworld. The protagonist, Jean Valjean, is sentenced to prison for
19 years for stealing a loaf of bread. After his release, Valjean plans
to rob monseigneur Myriel, a saintlike bishop, but cancels his plan.
However, he forfeits his parole by committing a minor crime, and for
this crime Valjean is haunted by the police inspector Javert. Valjean
eventually reforms and becomes under the name of M. Madeleine a
successful businessman, benefactor and mayor of a northern town. To
save an innocent man, Valjean gives himself up and is imprisoned in
Toulon. He escapes and adopts Cosette, an illegitimate child of a poor
woman, Fantine. Cosette grows up and falls in love with Marius, who is
wounded during a revolutionary fight. Valjean rescues Marius by means
of a flight through the sewers of Paris. Cosette and Marius marries and
Valjean reveals his past. - The story has been filmed several times and
made into a musical by the composer Claude-Michel Schönberg and the
librettist Alain Boublil, opening in 1980 in Paris. The English version
was realised in 1985 and the Broadway version followed two years later.
</blockquote>
<p>Like other Romantic writers, Hugo was interested in Spiritism,
and he experimented with table-tapping. After a number of fruitless
efforts, his table gave him the final title of <i>Les Misérables</i>.
Among Hugo's most ambitious works was an epic poem, <i>La Fin de Satan</i>,
a study of Satan's fall and the history of the universe. Satan is
presented more complex character than merely the embodiment of the
Evil, but when Milton saw in <i>Paradise Lost</i> in Satan's revolt
tragic, cosmic grandeur, Hugo brings forth the horror elements. The
poem was never completed.</p>
<p>Although Napoleon III granted in 1859 an amnesty to all
political exiles, Hugo did not take the bite. <i>Les Misérables</i>
appeared with an international advertising campaign. The book divided
critics but masses were enthusiastic. Pope Pius IX added it with <i>Madame
Bovary</i> and all the novels of Stendhal and Balzac to the Index of
Proscribed Books. Hugo's fleeting affairs with maids and country girls
inspired his <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Les Chansons des
rues et des bois</em></span></span>(1865). "The creaking of a trestle
bed / Is one of the sounds of paradise," he wrote. Hugo's daughter
Adèle, whose apathy and unsociability caused him much worries, went
after Lieutenant Albert Pinson to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where his
regiment was stationed, and followed also him to Barbados.&nbsp;<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em> Les Travailleurs de la Mer</em><strong>
</strong></span></span>(1866, <span class="st"><span class="ft">Toilers
of the Sea</span></span>), a story of hypocrisy, love, and suicide,
became a bestseller and later two films were made of it.</p>
<p>Adèle Hugo's biography of her husband appeared in 1863; she
died in 1868. Political upheavals in France and the proclamation of the
Third Republic made Hugo return to France. The unpopular Napoleon III
fell from power the Republic was proclaimed. In 1870 Hugo witnessed the
siege of Paris. "There is only enough sugar in Paris for ten days," he
wrote in his diary on 8 October. "Meat rationing began today." During
the period of the Paris Commune of 1871, Hugo lived in Brussels, from
where he was expelled for sheltering defeated revolutionaries. Hugo's
attitude to the Commune was ambivalent: "An admirable thing, stupidly
compromised by five or six deplorable ringleaders." </p>
<p>After a short time refuge in Luxemburg, he returned to Paris
and was elected as a senator of Paris in 1876. Sexually he was still
active and his maid, Blanche Lanvin, was the constant target of his
passions, but not the only one. "Take care not to wound that tender
heart and great soul," he wrote in his diary, to remember himself of
his principal mistress, Juliette Drouet. Hugo told Blance that penis
was a lyre, "and only poets know how to play them." After an exhaustive
period with her, Hugo suffered a mild stroke in June 1878. The
infuriated Juliette, his faithful companion form the 1830s, wrote to
her nephew: "You must try to track down the creature [Blanche] who has
destroyed my happiness.." Victor Hugo died in Paris on May 22, 1885. He
was given a national
funeral, attended by two million people, and buried in the Panthéon.</p>
