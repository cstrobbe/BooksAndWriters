<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>








<p>American poet and playwright, whose works combined themes from
ancient tragedies, Old Testament, and the legend of Christ with dark
views and absurdities of modern life. Jeffers called for a poetry of
'dangerous images' which would 'reclaim substance and sense, and
psychological reality.' He believed that 'poetry is bound to concern
itself chiefly with permanent aspects of life.' During his fifty-year
career, Jeffers published 18 volumes of verse. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I hate my verses, every line, every word. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Oh pale and brittle pencils ever to try </font><br>
<font size="2">One grass-blade's curve, or the throat of one bird </font><br>
<font size="2">That clings to twig, ruffled against white sky. </font><br>
<font size="2">Oh cracked and twilight mirrors ever to catch </font><br>
<font size="2">One color, onbe glinting flash, or the splendor of things."</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'Love of Wild Swan', 1935) </font></blockquote>

<p>John Robinson Jeffers was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, now part of Pittsburgh. 
His father, Dr. William Hamilton Jeffers, was a Presbyterian
minister and professor of Old Testament literature. After his first wife died in 1882, he had married Annie Tuttle, 
an orphan raised by cousins; she was more than twenty years his senior. 
The couple travelled widely in Europe, where
much of Jeffers's early education took place.  As a boy, Jeffers had tried to fly with homemade 
wings and many of his poems describe birds or refer to the myth of Icarus  &#8211;  his favorite 
animal and symbol was the hawk.  </p>
<p>Jeffers attended private  schools in Switzerland and Germany. A child prodigy, he 
learned several languages &#8211; he was fluent in French and German and could read Latin and Greek. 
The family moved in 1903 to Southern California, setting there in Highland Park (Los Angeles). 
After graduating from Occidental College in 1905, 
Jeffers  zigzagged in his studies of English  literature, medicine, and forestry 
in Los Angeles, Zürich, and  Seattle. For a period he taught physiology at the USC dental college. 
His first book, <i>Flagons and Apples </i>(1912), was a collection of simple love poems. 
It was followed by <i>Californians</i> (1916), which described the coastal region and its people. 
These works attracted little attention. Upon inheriting enough money, Jeffers was able to devote 
himself to writing poetry. </p>

<p>In 1913 Jeffers married a divorcee, Una Call Kuster, the former wife of a prominent Los Angeles attorney, 
and moved with her 
next year to Carmel, on the Monterey cost of California. He built there, on a knoll overlooking Carmel Bay,  
a stone house (the Tor House) and a forty-foot observation tower. In its shelter he watched the sweeping tides, a hawk 
circling in the sky, 
the cliffs and clouds and mountains. Jeffers' breakthrough collection, <i>Tamar and Other Poems</i>  (1924), was praised by T.S. Eliot. 
The subject of the narrative title poem was incest. Drawing loosely on the biblical
story of King David's daughter, this collection exhibited Jeffers's preoccupation with 
the themes of lust and man's destructive self-obsession.  

 </p>Jeffers' daily schedule was simple: he wrote in the morning, did some stone 
work or tree-planting in the afternoon, and 
and walked on the beach and read in the evening. Famous guests at the house included Edgar Lee Masters, James 
Cagney, Charles Chaplin, George Gershwin, Thornton Wilder, Langston Hughes, Aldous Huxley, Toscanini, Salvador 
Dalí, and others. Loyal to his surroundings, Jeffers focused in his  poems on the coastal scenery. 
But what lies beyond the Pacific Ocean, did not interest him much &#8211; he read European writers. 

After 
a visit to London in 1928, Jeffers lived an increasingly isolated life. On the three land sides 
of his property he planted a wall of eucalyptus and Monterey cypress. 

<p></p>






<p>In his youth Jeffers was interested in the thoughts of  <a href="freud.htm">Freud</a> 
and <a href="nietzsch.htm">Nietzsche</a>,  embracing  their penetrating and startling views 
on religious beliefs. Later he associated more to the works of 
<a href="wwhitman.htm">Walt Whitman</a>.  Though many times  
he had in the foreground the universe's beauty and the vision that humankind can help overcome its suffering, 
he once wrote: "I have seen these ways of God: 
I know of no reason / For fire and change and torture and the old returnings." 

Jeffers saw metropolitan life vicious 
and corrupting and even approved World War II and the Korean War as methods 
of eliminating undeserving human beings. 



His misanthropic thinking &#8211; not worse than that of Swift or Arthur Schopenhauer &#8211; 
manifested in 'Roan Stallion,' wherein a woman allows a stallion to trample her husband to 
death and then shoots the animal. In his famous poem 'Shine, Perishing Republic' he gave the 
advice: <b><font size="2">"</font></b>And boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, 
a clever / servant, insufferable master."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>  

</p>
<p>"The core elements of the Puritan sublime &#8211; the praise of God in a
redemptive wilderness, the duty of meditation, the metaphorical
construction of divinity in terms of the world's beauty&#8211; are almost a programmatic description of Robinson Jeffers' verse," Robert Zaller has said in  <span style="font-style: italic;">Robinson Jeffers and the American Sublime</span>
(2012). Jeffers' narratives were often tales of violence, adultery, and
incest, with settings in the Carmel-Big Sur Region of California. His
early influences were the English writers William Wordsworth and Thomas
Hardy. Many of his poems, as well as his plays, were based on Greek and
Roman myths. <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Dear Judas</i> (1929), starring E.G. Marshall in the title
role in the 1947 Broadway production, was banned in Boston on
theological grounds. The mayor of the city argued that it would
"violate the beliefs of many Bostonians in God and might even create
trouble by stirring religious enmity." Jeffers portrayed Mary and Jesus
in human terms &#8211; Jesus was an illegitimate child, and the mother and
son shared a lie that he was a Son of God. Jeffers's most famous play <i>Medea,</i>
was an adaptation of Euripides' classic drama. Directed by John Gielgud
and starring Judith Anderson, it opened on Broaway in October 1947 and
was a great success, running for 214 performances. Anderson had
proposed the idea to Jeffers and he wrote the role of Medea for her;
this work also helped him to overcome his writer's block. While in
Ireland in 1948, he almost died of pleurisy. </p>

<p>In 1937 Jeffers became a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and 
in 1945 he was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Mostly due to his 
philosophical pasifism, 
Jeffers did not aswer to the call to join the American war effort during WWI. In 'Pearl Harbor,' 
published in Oscar Williams' <i>New Poems 1944</i>, he wrote: "The war that we have carefully for years provoked / 
Catches us unprepared, amazed and indignant. Our war &#8211; / ships are shot / Like sitting ducks and our planes 
like nest-birds, both our / coasts ridiculously panicked, / And our leaders make orations." 
<i>The Double Axe and Other Poems </i>(1948), an antiwar collection, carried a publisher's note  to readers, 
telling  that "Random House feel compelled to go on record wityh its disagreement over some of the political 
views pronounced by the poet in this volume." 
<i>The Tower Beyond Tragedy</i> (1950) was based on two parts of Aeschylus's 
<i>Oresteia</i> and <i>The Cretan Woman</i>  (1951) was an adaptation  of Euripides's    <i>Hippolytus</i>. 
Jeffers died on January 20, 1962, in Tor House. During the final 
years he wrote few poems, his health and eyesight failed. </p>
