<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British journalist, secret service agent,
writer, whose famous creation was the superhero James Bond, agent 007.
Fleming spent some years with British Intelligence, but his  books are  far from reality <font face="Symbol">-</font>
they offer colorful locations, beautiful women, and exciting and
inventive adventures. Nowadays the character of James Bond is as
integral part of the popular culture as Winnie-the-Pooh or Tarzan. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was a dark, clean-cut face, with a
three-inch scar showing whitely down the sunburned skin of the right
cheek. The eyes were wide and level under straight, rather long black
brows. The hair was black, parted on the left, and carelessly brushed
so that a thick black comma fell down over the right eyebrow. The
longish straight nose ran down to a short upper lip below which was a
wide and finely drawn but cruel mouth. The line of jaw was straight and
firm. A section of dark suit, white short and black knitted tie
completed the picture."</b> (James Bond in </font><i><font size="2">Casino Royale</font></i><font size="2">, 1953) </font></blockquote>

<p>Ian Fleming was born in London, the son of Major Valentine Fleming,
a Conservative M.P., who was killed in World War I, and Evelyn St.
Croix Fleming. Ian was the second of four boys. Like his father and
elder brother before him, he was educated at Eton, where he excelled in
the difficult steeple chase contest. His first story, 'The Ordeal of
Caryl St. George', was published in the college magazine. From Eton he
was expelled following "some alleged trouble with one of the boys'
maids". </p>

<p>After resigning from the Sandhurst Military Academy without an
officer&#8217;s commission, which infuriated his mother, Fleming spent some
time studying languages in the Austrian Alps. There he became briefly
engaged with a Swiss woman, Monique Panchaud de Bottomes. Fleming
failed the Foreign Service exam, and found himself at the age of
twenty-three without a career. In 1931 he was employded by Reuters news
agency. For a period he worked as a journalist in Moscow, then a banker
and a stock-broker in London from 1935 to 1939. Even though Fleming was
a lousy stock broker, he managed make enough money to buy his own
place, a former baptist chapel. </p>
 

<p>In the 1930s, Fleming's elder brother Peter (1907-1971), a travel writer and novelist, gained fame with <i>Brazilian Adventure</i> (1933), about an expedition into Mato Grosso, and <i>News from Tartary</i> (1936), describing a journey from Peking to Kashmir. Peter Fleming published also science fiction stories. </p>
<p>During World War II Fleming was a high ranking naval officer in the
British intelligence. Owing in part to his facility with languages, he
was a personal assistant to Admiral John H. Godfrey, who served as the
model for James Bond's commanding officer, "M". Fleming organized the
No. 30 Assault Unit <font face="Symbol">-</font> the Germans had
successfully used similar Intelligence assault unit in Crete in 1941.
During a training exercise Fleming had to swim underwater and attach a
mine to a tanker. This act became material for the climax of <span style="font-style: italic;">Live and Let Die </span>(1954). Commissioned by the Admiralty, Fleming traveled around
the world to coordinate intelligence for the new British Pacific Fleet.
On one journey he visited Jamaica, where he later build his home. After
the war Fleming was a foreign manager of Kemsley Newspapers. He held
this post until the newspaper group became Thomson Newspapers in 1959.</p>

<p>Fleming's first book was not a spy novel but a foreign
correspondent's guide-book which was issued for the education of his
staff. In 1952 he married Lady Ann Rothermere, his long-time mistress,
in Jamaica. Their son Caspar was born a few months later. At the
wedding Noël Coward, Fleming's neighbor, served as master of
ceremonies. Lord Rothermere was the owner of the <i>Daily Mail</i>.
Fleming, who was her third husband, had first met her in 1939, but they
became seriously involved after the war. The marriage was unhappy. In
Jamaica Fleming had a long-running affair with Blanche Blackwell, whose
son founded Island Records, which turned Jamaican music global. </p>
<p>Most of the Bond books Fleming wrote in Jamaica; his house on the
north coast Fleming named 'Goldeneye'. Prime minister Anthony Eden
spent there some time during the Suez crisis before resigning in 1957.
The first Bond adventure, <span style="font-style: italic;">Casino Royale</span>, appeared in 1953, and it was followed 13 others. <i>Casino Royale</i>
was partly based on Fleming's less fortunate gambling experience in
Lisbon during the war. The work set up what became the basic structure
for most of the Bond books. Bond travels to some colorful place where
he meets one or two beautiful women who have secrets in their past.
Sometimes Bond is captured and tortured by his enemies, but always he
destroys the villain with delusions of grandeur, saves the world, and
gets the good girl. Bond has a flat in Chelsea, he drives Bentley, and
his Secret Service is located in a building overlooking Regent's Park
in London. Ann Fleming labelled her husband's books as "pornography". </p>
<blockquote><b></b>James Bond (the name was taken from that of an
American ornithologist), is the son of a Highland Scots father and a
Swiss mother. Both of Bond's parents were killed in a climbing accident
when he was eleven, and an inheritance of £1000 a year let him add some
other educational experiences to his boarding school years. At the age
of sixteen Bond lost his virginity in Paris. He joined in the late
1930s the British secret service, but switched to the navy when the war
broke out, attaining the rank of commander. Bond is a skilled golfer
and the best cardplayer, expert driver and a crack shot. Among his
friends is American Felix Leiter from the CIA. Bond's favorite drink is
vodka martini, shaken, not stirred. Although Bond carries a Beretta
pistol <i>Casino Royale</i>, he later trusts on Walther PPK,
originally designed for the German plain-clothes police. However, "Bond
mythology" is now mixed with elements from the films. In 2000 appeared
an illustrated book, <i>James Bond: The Secret World of 007</i> by Alastair Dougall, which do not mention the writer Ian Fleming <font face="Symbol"><font face="Symbol">-</font></font>
in tune with the idea of the book. Dougall's work sheds light on
'"Agent Double-O-Seven and, perhaps most exciting of all, the
extraordinary vehicles and gadgetry supplied by Q Branch for his use
"in the field".' The consultant editor was Dave Worrall, who founded
The James Bond Collectors Club. </blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">From Russia, with Love&nbsp; </span>(1957) broke the formula: 007 appeared in the eleventh chapter. 
President John F. Kennedy listed it in 1961 as one of his favorite books. The settings were a nod to Eric Ambler's 
novel <i>The Mask of Dimitrios</i> (1938), which takes the reader on a journey to Turkey and the Levant, but Fleming no doubt was familiar with  Graham Greene's <i> Stamboul Train </i> (1932) 
and Agatha Christie's <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> (1934). 

In the story Tatiana Romanova, a beautiful Russian intelligence clerk, engineers a plot which would lure Bond to Istanbul. 
At the same time the Russian SMERSH agency is planning to get rid of the almost "mythological force upon whom the 
British Secret Service depends." Bond is helped in Istanbul by Darko Kerim, the local station chief. Tatiana 
meets Bond <font face="Symbol">-</font> against all suspicions she has fallen in love with him. They travel through the 
Balkans on the Orient Express, where they are pursued by Russian agents. Bond wins Donavan "Red" Grant, an 
executioner, and Rosa Klebb, who has deadly boots. The novel was a hit, and reviews were generally favorable. The film 
version was made at London's Pinewood Studios and on locations in Turkey, Scotland, and Madrid. "Less dependent on the 
fantastic element that would predominate in later Bond pictures, it resembles, in the opinion of Bond biographer John Brosnan, 
more of a Hitchcockian style thriller like North by Northwest. In general, this is a grittier, 
more "realistic," relatively less tongue-in-cheek James Bond &#8211; before technology, scenery, and endless strings 
on "Bond Girls" became the foci of the productions." <font size="2">(from<i> Novels into Film </i>by John 
C. Tibbetts and James M. Welsh, 1999) </font></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Doctor No </span>(1958),
inspired by Sax Rohmer's Fu-Manchu novels, Fleming combined elements of
science fiction in the story. The villain, Dr. No, has developed a
radio beam and intends to deflect U.S. test missiles from their
projected course. <i>Live and Let Die</i> introduced Mr. Big, a new
member of SMERSH, the enemy agency Bond so often found working against.
Other famous villains include Auric Goldfinger from <span style="font-style: italic;">Goldfinger</span> (1959), KGB killers Rosa Klebb and Donovan Grant (<i>From Russia, with Love</i>) and Scaramanga (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Man with the Golden Gun</span>,
1965). Goldfinger was named after the architect Erno Goldfinger, a
Marxist and the designer of the Modernist tower blocks in London,
Balfron Tower and Trellick Tower. His sidekick is Oddjob, played by
Hawaiian weightlifter Harold Sakata in the film. Le Chiffre from <i>Casino Royale</i> is said to be based on the notorious English writer and occult figure  <a href="crowley.htm">Aleister Crowley</a>.
Bond's arch nemesis was the half-Polish, half-Greek Ernst Stavro
Blofeld, the founder of SPECTRE, an acronym for Special Executive for
Counterespionage, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion. Blofeld appeared
in three novels: <span style="font-style: italic;">Thunderball</span> (1961), <span style="font-style: italic;">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</span> (1963), and <span style="font-style: italic;">You Only Live Twice</span> (1964). In the latter book the character of Dikko Henderson was based on Richard Hughes, the <i>Sunday Times</i> correspondent in the Far East. Also other Fleming's friends were put into 
Bond books. </p>

<p>In 1956 Fleming started selling his novels to be adapted for a comic
strip. He was asked to contribute to a series of articles for London's <i>Sunday Times</i>
on diamond smuggling. The articles appeared in book form in 1957.
Fleming published A successful children's book about a magical car, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang</span>. "But some motorcars <font face="Symbol">-</font> mine, for instance, and perhaps yours <font face="Symbol">-</font>
are different. If you get to like them and understand them, if you are
kind to them and don't scratch their paint and bang their doors, if you
fill them up and pump them up when they need it, of you keep them clean
and polish and out the rain and snow as much as possible, you will
find, you MAY find, that they become almost like persons <font face="Symbol">-</font> MORE than just ordinary persons <font face="Symbol">-</font>
MAGICAL PERSONS!!!" The story was adapted into a musical film in 1968.
Fleming wrote the book for his son, Caspar, who committed suicide at
the age of 23. </p>
<p>Fleming also contributed to many periodicals under the pseudonym Atticus. Among his non-fiction  is the travel book <span style="font-style: italic;">Thrilling Cities</span> (1963). It was based on articles published in <i>Sunday Times</i> in 1959-60. Fleming's first journey, paid by Roy Thomson, the publisher, took him <b>a</b>round
the world, and the second to European cities. His text was edited in
the newspaper but in the book it appeared in original length. According
to Fleming, the best hotel in Hong Kong is <i>Peninsula Court</i>. In Japan a traveler must remember that <i>sake</i> should be taken warm and in Monte Carlo the best casino is Beaulieu. Fleming did not like New York <font face="Symbol">-</font> he felt that it is losing its heart <font face="Symbol">-</font> but in Hamburg he followed with enthusiasm mud wrestling in the middle of the night. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When Bond was in Paris he invariably
stuck to the same addresses. He stayed at the Terminus Nord, because he
liked station hotels and because this was the least pretentious and
most anonymous of them. He had luncheon at the Café de la Paix, the
Rotunde or the Dôme, because the food was good enough and it amused him
to watch the people. If he wanted a solid drink he had it at Harry's
Bar, both because of the solidity of the drinks and because, on his
first ignorant visit to Paris at the age of sixteen, he had done what
Harry' s advertisement in the </b></font><b><i><font size="2">Continental Daily Mail</font></i><font size="2">
had told him to do and said to his taxi-driver 'Sank Roo Doe Noo'. That
had started one of the memorable evenings of his life, culminating in
the loss, almost simultaneous, of his virginity and his notecase." </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">For Your Eyes Onl</font></i><font size="2">y, 1960) </font></blockquote>
<p>The  first adaptation of a James Bond spy story was <i>Casino Royale</i>, produced in CBS's anthology 
series <i>Climax!</i> in 1954. Peter Lorre played the Soviet agent Le Chiffre, Barry Nelson was Jimmy Bond. An incomplete telerecording 
of the show surfaced in the 1980s. 

<i>Doctor No</i>'s film version was released in 1963. The spring of the same year saw the publication of <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i>,
including a limited edition of 250. The cover featured the Bond family
coat of arms complete with the motto 'The World Is Not Enough.' In
between writing Fleming developed a passion for treasurehunting, not
merely in the Caribbean Islands and Seychelles, where he followed old
pirate's maps and tales, but also in England. <font face="Symbol"></font></p>
<p>In spite of warning's from doctors, Fleming did not give up his
outdoor activities, and the final heart attack which ended his life
came at the Royal St. George's Sandwich golf course in Kent on 12
August, 1964. <i>The Man with the Golden Gun, </i>finished by Fleming's literary executors, was published posthumously. <span style="font-style: italic;">Octopussy</span>, a collection containing two of Fleming's Bond stories, appeared in 1966. </p>
 

<p>In 1981 John Gardner started to write James Bond books and later the
series was continued by Raymond Benson. Also Robert Markham (pseudonym of 
<a href="amis.htm">Kingsley Amis</a>) has written 007 sequels. <font face="Symbol">-</font> <b>See also</b>: <a href="charteri.htm">Leslie Charteris</a>. <font face="Symbol">-</font> Before acting
in James Bond films, Roger Moore played <i>The Saint</i>
in the 1960s television series. Fleming had expressed doubts about Sean
Connery in his role as Agent 007. Fleming's choise was the
sophisticated David Niven, but after<i> From Russia with Love</i> he said that the actor was much as he had imagined Bond.
