<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->First major American novelist, whose best-known tales of frontier adventure include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Last of the Monicans</span> (1826), an adventure story set in the Lake Champlain. It has been filmed several times, among 
others in 1936 and 1992. Through his Leatherstocking series Cooper created the archetype of the 18th-century 
frontiersman, Natty Bumppo. He lives free, close to nature, while the settlers bring 'civilization' that destroys 
the wilderness. Cooper wrote over thirty novels &#8211; he considered <span style="font-style: italic;">The Pathfinder </span>(1841) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Deerslayer</span> (1840) 
his best works. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Few men exhibit greater diversity, or,
if we may so express it, greater antithesis of character than the
native warrior of North America. In war, he is daring, boastful,
cunning, ruthless, self-denying, and self-devoted; in peace, just,
generous, hospitable, revengeful, superstitious, modest, and commonly
chaste."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Last of the Mohicans</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>James Fenimore Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey, the son of
Quakers, Judge William Cooper and Elisabeth Fenimore Cooper. His father
was a representative of the 4th and 6th Congress, and had attained
wealth by developing virgin land. The family moved to Cooperstown, New
York, which Judge Cooper had founded. James Fenimore spent his youth
partly on the family estate on the shores of Otsego Lake. He roamed in
the primeval forest and developed a love of nature which marked his
books. Cooper was educated in the village school, and in 1800-02 in the
household of the rector of St. Peter's. </p>
<p>In his junior year Cooper was expelled from Yale because of a series
of pranks, which included training a donkey to sit in a professor's
chair. Encouraged by his father, Cooper joined the Navy and served on
the Sterling, 1806-07. On his return to the United States, he received
a warrant as a midshipman. In 1808 he served on the Vesuvius and on the
Wasp in the Atlantic in 1809. These experiences later inspired his sea
stories. Upon his father's death in 1809, Cooper became financially
independent. He resigned his commission in 1811 and married Susan
Augusta De Lancey, who was a descendent of the early governors of New
York colony. </p>
<p>From the early 1810s Cooper took up the comfortable life of a 
gentleman farmer. He lived in Mamaroneck, New York from 1811 to 1814, 
then in Cooperstown, and from 1817 to 1821 in Scarsdale, New York. A 
change of fortune connected with his father's estate ended the Coopers' 
rural idyll. He settled in Westchester, living on his wife's land. He was 
very fond of reading and one day when he had finished an English novel he 
said: "I could write a better story than that myself!"  
When his wife challenged him to write the book Cooper set to work, beginning a  prolific literary career. </p>

<p>Cooper's first novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Precaution </span>(1820) was an imitation of Jane Austen's novels and did not meet with great success. His second,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Spy</span> (1821), , set in Westchester Country, was based on Sir <a href="wscott.htm">Walter Scott</a>'s <i>Waverly </i>series,
and told an adventure tale about the American Revolution. The
protagonist is Harvey Birch, a supposed loyalist who actually is a spy
for George Washington, disguised as 'Mr Harper'. The book brought
Cooper fame and wealth and he gave up farming. Scott inspired Cooper to
draw stereotypes of light and dark, good and evil, and dichotomize the
female into the fair and pure and the dark and tainted. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Pioneers</span>
(1823) started his preoccupation with a series of frontier adventures
and pioneer life, in which he spent about twenty years. The novels
depicted the adventures of Natty Bumppo, also called Leatherstocking or
Hawkeye, and his Indian companion Chingachgook. The books, which were
not written in chronological order, included the classics <i>The Deerslayer</i>, <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>,<i> The Pathfinder</i>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Prairie</span> (1827). </p>
<p>Cooper had the idea of transporting Leatherstocking to the Far West 
while he was writing <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>. He had read with 
care Major Stephen H. Long's account of his expedition up the Platte 
River. During the spring of 1826 or earlier he met a young Pawnee chief 
who became the model for Hard-Heart in <i>The Prairie</i>. From the narrative of 
the Lewis and Clark expedition he took such names as Mahtoree and Weucha for Sioux chiefs. 
The character of Natty, who stood about six feet in his moccasins, drew upon folk traditions of 
historical pioneers such as Daniel Boone. Natty's friendship with the Delaware chief Chingachgook 
established him as a mediating figure between the white, advancing settlers, and the threatened 
culture of the Native Americans. Natty himself was educated by the Delaware Indians, who gave him the 
name 'Hawkeye'. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I will go upon the rock, boys, and look
abroad for the savages," said Ishmael shortly after, advancing towards
them wit a mien which he intended should be conciliating, at the same
time that it was authoritative. "If there is nothing to fear, we will
go out on the plain; the day is too good to be lost in words, like
women in the towns wrangling over their tea and sugared cakes."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Prairie</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p><i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> was originally published by Carey and Lea of Philadelphia in two volumes. 
The great Rousseaun tale of a <i>bon sauvage</i>
and the clash between cultures has inspired several films, and many
television programs have utilized its plot elements. The feature-length
silent version of 1920 focused on the love triangle between Uncas
(Albert Rosco), Cora (Barbara Redford), and Magua (Wallace Berry). In
Michael Mann's version (1992) Cora is no longer of mixed race, and the
interracial relationship between Uncas and Alice is left undeveloped.
Uncas and Chingachgook are played for the first time by native American
actors, Eric Schweig and Russell Means. "Overall, the confrontation of
racial adversaries is still resolved through violence instead of
romantic coupling (i.e., Uncas and Cora; or Uncas and Alice; or Hawkeye
and a mixed-race Cora), which keeps the centuries-old doctrine of
racial purity intact. The next version of <i>The Last of the Mohican</i> will undoubtedly rewrite the racial politics of the story in a way consistent with future needs and sensibilities." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Novels into Films </font></i><font size="2">by John C. Tibbets and James M. Welsh, 1999) </font></p>
<p>In the beginning of the 1820s Cooper lived in New York City and
participated in its intellectual life and politics. He wrote a series
of sea adventures, starting from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Pilot</span> (1824), a genuine American sea tale about the exploits of John Paul Jones. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">The Red Rover</span> (1827), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wing-and-Wing</span>&nbsp; (1842), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Two Admirals</span> (1842), <span style="font-style: italic;">Afloat and Ashore</span> (1844), <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sea Lions</span> (1849). <br>

</p>
<p>From 1826 to 1833 Cooper lived in Europe, where he published romances 
and unsuccessful books about democracy, politics, and society. He served 
as the US consul at Lyons and travelled a great deal. In Europe he became 
friends with Sir Walter Scott and Marquis de Lafayette, who partly 
inspired his essay <span style="font-style: italic;">Notions of America</span> (1828). He was especially inspired 
by Italy and lived in Tasso's villa at Sorrento, but literary meetings in 
London annoyed him and the Thames river did not impress him, it was 
"a stream of trivial expanse." The British writer D.H. Lawrence called him 
later "A gentleman in the worst sense."  </p>

<p>During the last decades of his life Cooper was earning less from his books but was forced to go on writing for 
income. In 1833 Cooper returned to the Unites States, but he refused to 
attend a dinner planned in his honor. Cooper first lived in New York City and then in Cooperstown. Feeling 
ill-treated by journalists, he fought the press with libel suits, winning most of his cases. However, 
with his biting opinions he also lost friends, and his lack of circumspection was especially vulnerable 
to such criticism as presented by <a href="mtwain.htm">Mark Twain</a> in his essay <i>Fenimore Cooper's 
Literary Offences</i> (1895). His later works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Satanstoe</span> (1845), a historical novel of manners, 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Chainbearer</span> (1845), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Red-Skins</span> (1846), which form the trilogy called 'The Littlepage Manuscripts'. 
The novels deal with the anti-rent controversy and its historical background. Cooper defended in the work the 
landlords' rights &#8211; the tenants of the New York had refused to pay rent and the author saw in the 
controversy a crisis in American democracy. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The American Democrat</span> Cooper also expressed his political 
and social views. Cooper died at Otsego Hall, on September 14, 1851. He 
was buried in the cemetery of Cooperstown. His wife followed him four months later.</p>
<p><i>The Leatherstocking Tales</i> are a series of novels set in the early frontier period of American history. <i>The 
Deerslayer</i> depicts Natty Bumppo's experiences as a young man. The events take place in the 1740s in the upstate 
New York, where Deerslayer is joined by his Mohican friend, Chingachgook, to rescue two frontiersmen. <i>The Last of 
the Mohicans</i> in set in the 1757 during the Seven Years' War between the French and the British. Hawkeye / Bumppo 
and his friends Chingachgook and Uncas with a group of English civilians are betrayed by their Indian guide Magua. 
Hawkeye revenges the death of his friend Uncas and an English lady, Cora, and kills Magua. <i>The Pathfinder </i>is 
also set during the war, and tells a story of betrayal and love. Jasper Western, a sailor is suspected of being 
disloyal to the English, is arrested to the despair of Mabel, who is in love with him. The real traitor is Muir,  
the lieutenant who had accused Jasper. He is killed by Arrowhead, a Tuscarora Indian. <i>The Pioneers</i> is set in 1793 in Otsego County in the recently settled region of New York state. Natty Bumppo, now known as 
Leatherstocking, and his friend Oliver Edwards befriend Judge Temple and his daughter Elisabeth. Chingachgook dies 
in a forest fire in spite of Bumppo's efforts to save him. Oliver Edward's lost grandfather is found and Oliver and 
Elisabeth are betrothed at the end. <i>The Prairie</i> is set in 1804. Natty Bumppo meets a wagon train and helps it 
to evade an Indian raiding party. The travellers endure a prairie fire, a buffalo stampede, and capture by the Sioux. 
In the end of the tale Bumppo peacefully dies on the prairie, surrounded by his friends."A valiant, a just, and 
a wise warrior, has gone on the path which will lead him to the blessed grounds of his people!" he said. 
"When the voice of the Wahcondah called him, he was ready to answer. Go, my children; remember the just 
chief of the Palefaces, and clear your own tracks from briers!" </p>
