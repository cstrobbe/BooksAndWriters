<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific writer of romantic suspense, an
American counterpart of Mary Stewart and Victoria Holt. Phyllis
Whitney's career spanned over five decades. For the first 15 years of
her life, she lived in Japan, China, and the Philippines, and then in
the United States. In most of her novels, Whitney presented the reader
with a new location. She also published three textbooks on writing
fiction. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The embrace was long and fervent.
It was Elise who broke suddenly away, pushing her hands against his
chest, running a few steps away from him. He laughed softly and came
after her at once, but this time she held him off, shaking her head,
joining his laughter with her own, playing her tantalizing game."</b>
(from </font><i><font size="2">Lost Island</font></i><font size="2">,
1970) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Phyllis A. Whitney was born in Yokohama, Japan, of American
parents. In her name, the "A" stands for "Ayame," which is the Japanese
word for "iris". Her earliest years Whitney spent in Japan, China, and
the Philippines, where the family ran a hotel. After her father,
Charles Joseph Whitney died in China she returned at the age of 15 to
the United States with her mother, Mary Lillian Mandeville. They first
lived in Berkely and then moved to San Antonio. Whitney attended
schools in Texas and California. She graduated in 1924 from McKinley
High School in Chicago, where she had moved after her mother had died
of cancer. In 1925 she married George A. Garner, an accountant; they
had one daughter. The marriage ended in divorce in 1945. </p>
      <p>Before becoming a writer, Whitney worked in bookstores and at
the Chicago Public Library. For a period, she attended a small writing
club. Some of her stories appeared in the pulp magazines. "I'd had a
hard time living through all the rejection slips until I could be
published in the lowliest markets," she once recalled. Her first novel,
      <span style="font-style: italic;">A Place for Ann</span> (1941),
brought her some success, but also confidence in her abilities as a
writer. <span style="font-style: italic;">Willow Hill</span> (1947)
was ahead of its time and enlarged Whitney's range of subjects: a young
white girl and her high school friends dealt with the integration of a
housing project in their neighborhood. </p>
      <p>Whitney's first book of adult fiction was <span style="font-style: italic;">Red is for Murder</span>, put of by the
Ziff-Davis Publishing Company in 1943. The work, which was prompted by
Whitney's fascination with the art of window dressing, sold only 3,000
copies. In the story the protagonist is an amateur sleuth, a young girl
who works in a Chicago department store, where she is stalked by a
killer. Later the book was reprinted as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Red Carnelian</span> in paperback
editions. It was not until the mid-1950s when Whitney began writing
regularly for adults. </p>
      <p>In 1942 Whitney took a job as children's book editor for the <i>Chicago
Sun</i>, although in the beginning she thought that she knew nothing
about book reviewing. After four years, she transferred to <i>Philadelphia
Enquirer</i> (1947-48). She taught fiction writing for children at
Northwestern University in Illinois (1945), and at New York University
from 1947 to 1958. In 1950 she married Lovell F. Jahnke, a businessman;
he died in 1973. With her husband she lived for decades on Staten
Island, the scene of the romantic historical novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Quicksilver Pool</span> (1955).</p>
      <p>As a result of her travels in different parts of the world and
childhood memories in Japan and other Asian counties, exotic settings
became an important element in her works. "My own springboard, from
which I take off in the beginning, is usually a new setting," she once
said. "I have a strong feeling toward places."<font size="2"> (from
'Springboard to Fiction' in <i>The Writer</i>, October 1976) </font>Whitney's
enthusiasm for colorful historical background inspired such works as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Trembling Hills</span> (1956), a love
story set at the time of the San Francisco earthquake, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Skye Cameron</span> (1957), set in the
nineteenth-century New Orleans. </p>
      <p>Whitney was one of the major writers, who contributed to the
neo-gothic boom of the post-war decades. <span style="font-style: italic;">Thunder Heights</span> (1960), about the
nineteenth-century Hudson River Valley, continued the radition of
Daphne du Maurier's <i>Rebecca</i> (1938). It was published by Gerald
Gross at Ace Books as the first title of the "gothic" series. Like the
English writers du Maurier, Mary Stewart, and Victoria Holt, Whitney
wove supernatural elements into the ordinary lives of her heroines. </p>
      <blockquote><b>Gothic romance/gothic mysteries:</b> The stories
have a woman as the main character, plots are often melodramatic and
contain elements of adventure, mystery, love and the supernatural. The
popular genre dates from the earlier tradition of the gothic novel,
beginning from Hugh Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto </i>(1764). In
nineteenth century particularly the <a href="/ebronte.htm">Brontë</a>
sisters developed the genre further in such works as<i> Jane Eyre</i>
and <i>Wuthering Height</i> (both 1847). Among the modern classics of
the gothic style is <a href="/dumaurie.htm">Daphne du Maurier</a>'s <i>Rebecca</i>
, which has retained its popularity since its appearance in 1938. <b>Other
writers of gothic romances: </b>Dorothy Eden, Virginia Coffman,
Barbara Michaels (writing as Barbara Michaels and Elizabeth Peters),
Mary Higgins Clark, Daoma Winston. <font size="2"><font size="2"> </font></font></blockquote>
      <p>Many of Whitney's novels for young people, especially those
published by Houghton Mifflin and Westminster Press between 1941 and
1954, were written more for girls. They have often titles beginning
with the word "mystery" or "secret" or include a female name, with some
exceptions, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Step to the Music</span>
(1953), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fire and the Gold</span>
(1956), both published by Crowell. The adventures are set in different
countries around the world <font face="Symbol">-</font> in Turkey (<span style="font-style: italic;">Black Amber</span>), Norway, Japan (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Moonflower</span>), Greece, South
Africa (<span style="font-style: italic;">Blue Fire</span>), and many
places in the United States. Often the stories deal with the
relationship between mothers and daughters, identity problems, and
women trying to come to terms with their own past. </p>
      <p>Whitney's protagonists are generally independent but
vulnerable. "Probably the best way to start any story, long or short,"
Whitney had advised aspiring writers, "is to show a character with a
problem doing something interesting." During the story the heroine
finds her true self, family secrets are revealed, and the heroine's
life is changed permanently. "Our world once more has walls of
"reality" around it &#8211; yet I catch glimpses at times of something that
has touched and changed me, and I know I will never again say "I don't
believe." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Singing
Stones</font></i><font size="2">, 1990). </font>She never built a
series featuring a character that readers could enjoy book after book,
but in general her characters were well drawn, sensitive, and
interesting. For some reason, her novels have not attracted the
attention Hollywood film makers or television producers. </p>
      <p>Illness and other challenges created a lengthy gap from the
late 1970s in Whitney's publishing record of her novels for young
adults. In 1992 she was back with <span style="font-style: italic;">Star
Flight</span>, about a woman investigating the causes of her
grandmother's suicide and her own husband's death. The story was set at
Chimney Rock and Lake Lure which the author visited with her daughter
and her husband. At the age of 87, Whitney went up in a hot air balloon
to use the experience in her novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Singing Stones</span> (1990). "During those quiet moments when the
burner wasn't being activated, all was still and calm and utterly
peaceful. Only once when the burner was on did I look up into the
fabric overhead where deafening flame speared toward the top, though
never touching anything. That was a bit frightening to watch, and I
didn't look upward again. At least all that hot air kept us warm, as
Jilly had said it would." Her 76th book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Amethyst Dreams</span> (1997) she
published at the age of 94. The story was set in the sunny, seaside
paradise of North Carolina's Topsail Island, and depicts the mystery
around Hallie Knight's friend Susan, who has disappeared from her home.
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"During these years, even my view
of death had changed and broadened. I had gradually come to a
conviction that some sort of "life" went on beyond the ending we called
death... I believe in the healing our minds could perform, that the
love could perform..."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Singing
Stones</font></i><font size="2">, 1990) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Whitney's several awards included Edgar Allan Poe best
juvenile award (1961); Sequoyah Children's Book award (1963); Malice
Domestic award (1989); Agatha award (1990) for lifetime achievement,
and Lifetime Achievement award from Society of Midland Authors (1995).
In 1975 Whitney served as president of Mystery Writers of America and
was named a Grand Master by that organization in 1988. Her first
textbook, <span style="font-style: italic;">Writing Juvenile Fiction</span>,
came out in 1947. It was followed by<span style="font-style: italic;">
Writing Juvenile Stories and Novels</span> (1976) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Guide to Fiction Writing</span> (1982),
which is along with <a href="highsm">Patricia Highsmith</a>'s<i>
Plotting And Writing Suspense Fiction</i> (1966) among the most
practical introductions to the craft of writing. Whitney also served on
      <i>The Writer</i> magazine's editorial board. She died from
pneumonia at the age of 104, on February 8, 2008, in Faber, Va. </p>
