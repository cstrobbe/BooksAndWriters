      <p>French aviator and writer, real life hero who looked at
adventure and danger with poet's eyes &#8211; sometimes from the viewpoint of
a child. Saint-Exupéry's most famous work is <i>The Little Prince</i>
(1943), which he also illustrated. It has become one of the classics of
children's literature of the 20th century. During World War II
Saint-Exupéry served as a pilot. He was shot down on a mission over
France in 1944. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Grown-ups never understand
anything for themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always
and forever explaining things to them." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Little Prince</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was born in Lyons into an old family
of provincial nobility; one of his ancestors had fought with the
Americans at Yorktown. His father was an insurance company executive,
who died of a stroke in 1904. His artistic talented widow, Marie de
(Fonscolombe) Exupéry (1875-1972), moved with her children to Le Mans
in 1909. Saint-Exupéry spent his childhood years at the castle of
Saint-Maurice-de-Rémens, surrounded by sisters, aunts, cousins, nurses,
and<i> fräuleins</i>. He was educated at Jesuit schools in Montgré and
Le Mans, and in Switzerland at a Catholic boarding school (1915-1917),
run by the Marianist Fathers in Fribourg. After failing his final
examination at a university preparatory school, he entered the École
des Beaux-Arts to study architecture.</p>
      <p>The turning point in Saint-Exupéry's life came in 1921 when he
started his military service in the 2ND Regiment of Chasseurs, and was
sent to Strasbourg for training as a pilot. He had flown, with a pilot,
for the first time in 1912. On July 9, 1921, he made his first flight
alone in a Sopwith F-CTEE. Next year Saint-Exupéry obtained his pilot's
licence, and was offered a transfer to the air force. However, when his
fiancée's family objected, he settled in Paris where he took an office
job and started to write. The following years were unlucky. His
engagement with Louise de Vilmorin broke off, and he had no success in
his work and business &#8211; he had several jobs, including that of
bookkeeper and automobile salesman. Saint-Exupéry's first tale,
'L'Aviateur' was published in 1926 in the literary magazine <i>Le
Navire d'argent</i>. His true calling Saint-Exupéry then found in
flying the mail for the commercial airline company Aéropostale. He flew
the mail over North Africa for three years, escaping death several
times. In 1928 he became the director of the remote Cap Juby airfield
in Rio de Oro, Sahara. His house was a wooden shack and he slep on a
thin straw mattress. "I have never loved my house more than when I
lived in the desert," he recalled. </p>
      <p>In this isolation Saint-Exupéry learned to love the desert,
and used its harsh beauty as the background for <i>The Little Prince </i>and
      <i>The Wisdom of the Sands</i> (1948). During these years
Saint-Exupéry wrote his first novel, <i>Southern Mail </i>(1929),
which celebrated the courage of the early pilots, flying at the limits
of safety, to speed on the mail and win a commercial advantage over
rail and steamship rivals. Another story line in the work depicted the
author's failed love affair with the novelist Louise de Vilmorin. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Over and done with. Thirty
thousand letters come safely through. The airline company kept drilling
it into you: the precious mail, more precious than life itself. Enough
to keep thirty thousand lovers going... Lovers, be patient! In the
sinking fire of sunset here we come. Behind Bernis the clouds are
thick, churned by the whirlwind in its mountain bowl. Before him lies a
land decked out in sunlight, the tender muslin of the meadows, the rich
tweed of the woods, the ruffled veil of the sea."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Night Flight</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1929 Saint-Exupéry moved to South America, where he was
appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina Company. </p>
      <p>Saint-Exupéry flew post through the Andes. This experience
gave the basis for his second novel, <i>Night Flight</i>, which became
an international bestseller, won the Prix Femina, and was adapted for
screen in 1933, starring Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore. In the story
Rivière, the hard-bitten airport chief, has left behind all thoughts of
retirement and sees the work of flying the mail as his fate. "We don't
ask to be eternal', he thought. 'What we ask is not to see acts and
objects abruptly lose their meaning. The void surrounding us then
suddenly yawns on every side." <font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> Night Flight</font></i><font size="2">)</font></p>
      <p>Saint-Exupéry married in 1931 Consuelo Gómez Carillo, a widow,
whose other literary friends included Maurice Maeterlinck and Gabriele
D'Annunzio. "He wasn't like other people," she wrote later in <i>Mémoires
de la rose</i>, "but like a child or an angel who has fallen down from
the sky." The marriage was stormy. Consuelo was jealous for good
reasons and felt neglected, when her husband did not spend much time at
home. He also had affairs with other women. </p>
      <p>After the air mail business in Argentina was closed down,
Saint-Exupéry started to fly post between Casablanca and Port-Étienne
and then he served as a test pilot for Air France and other airline
companies. He wrote for <i>Paris-Soir</i> and covered the May Day
events in Moscow in 1936, and wrote a series of articles on the Spanish
Civil War. Saint-Exupéry lived a traveling, adventurous life: he
persuaded Air-France to let him fly a Caudron Simoun (F-ANRY), and had
an aviation accident in 1935 in North Africa. He walked in the desert
for days before being saved by a caravan. In 1937, he bought another
Caudron Simoun, and was severely injured in Guatemala in a plane crash.
      </p>
      <p>Encouraged by his friend André Gide, Saint-Exupéry wrote
during his convalescence a book about the pilot's profession. <i>Wind,
Sand and Stars</i>, which appeared in 1939, won the French Academy's
1939 Grand Prix du Roman and the National Book Award in the United
States. The director <a href="jrenoir.htm">Jean Renoir</a> (1894-1979)
wanted to shoot the film and had conversations with the author, mostly
about literary subjects which he recorded. At that time Renoir worked
in Hollywood where everyone shot on sets. Renoir's idea was to make the
film at the locations described in the text. The book had been
successful in the U.S. but nobody wanted to produce its film version. </p>
      <p>After the fall of France in World War II Saint-Exupéry joined
the army, and made several daring flights, although he was considered
unable to fly military planes because of his several injures. However,
he was awarded the Croix de Guerre. In June he went to live with his
sister in the Unoccupied Zone of France, and then he escaped to the
United States. When the Vichy régime appointed him to its National
Council, he protested at this "untimely appointment." Saint-Exupéry was
criticized by his countrymen for not supporting de Gaulle's Free France
forces in London. <i>Flight to Arras</i> (1942), published in New
York, depicts his hopeless flight over the enemy lines, when France was
already beaten. The book was banned in France by the German
authorities. In 1943 he rejoined the French air force in North Africa.
Also in Algiers he continued his lifelong habit of writing in the air.
After a bad landing his commanding officer decided that he was too old
to go on flying, but after a pause he was allowed to rejoin his unit.
In 1943 Saint-Exupéry published his best-known work, <i>The Little
Prince</i> (1943), a children's fable for adults, which has been
translated into over 150 languages. It has been claimend that <i>The
Little Prince</i> is the best-selling book after the <i>Bible</i> and
Karl Marx's <i>Das Kapital</i>. Saint-Exupéry devoted to book to his
friend Léon Werth. Its narrator is a pilot who has crash-landed in a
desert. He meets a boy, who turns out to be a prince from another
planet. The prince tells about his adventures on Earth and about his
precious rose from his planet. He is disappointed when he discovers
that roses are common on Earth. A desert fox convinces him that the
prince should love his own rare rose and finding thus meaning to his
life, the prince returns back home. The rare rose is usually
interpreted as Consuelo. </p>
      <p>On July 31, 1944 Saint-Exupéry took off from an airstrip in
Sardinia on a flight over southern France. His plane disappeared - he
was shot down over the Mediterranean, or perhaps there was an accident,
or it was suicide. Saint-Exupéry had felt isolated and alone his
squadron, and was pessimistic about the future. On one mission he had
trouble with his oxygen mask and nearly passed out. Saint-Exupéry left
behind the unfinished manuscript of <i>La Citadelle</i> (Wisdom of the
Sands) and some notebooks, which were published posthumously. "Freedom
and constraint are two aspects of the same necessity, which is to be
what one is and no other." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">La Citadelle</font></i><font size="2">, 1948)</font> The book
reflects Saint-Exupéry's increasing interest in politics, and his later
ideals. The
author's last flight inspired <a href="../../../hugoprat.htm">Hugo
Pratt</a>'s comics <i>Saint-Exupéry</i> (1996). In 1998, a fisherman
found Saint-Exupéry's bracelet from the sea, 150 kilometers west from
Marseilles. His and Conzuela Gomez Castillo's name were recognized from
it. However, later news revealed, that the bracelet was probably a
forgery. Eventually Saint-Exupéry plane, Lockheed Lightning P-38, was
found in May 2000. </p>
