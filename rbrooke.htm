<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Promising English poet who died young in World War
I. Brooke's best-known work is the sonnet sequence <span style="font-style: italic;">1914 and Other Poems</span>
(1915), containing the famous 'The Soldier.' Poets have always
glorified war, and Brooke did his best to continue the tradition, and
sacrifice himself in this effort. His death made him the hero of the
first phase of the war and a canonized symbol of all the gifted young
people destroyed by the conflict. However, Brooke's poetry with its
patriotic mood and naive enthusiasm went out of fashion as the
realities of warfare were fully understood. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"If I should die, think only this of me:</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">That there's some corner of a foreign field </font><br>
<font size="2">That is forever England." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><font size="2">'The Soldier'</font><font size="2">, in <i>New Numbers</i>, 1915) </font></blockquote>

<p>Rupert Brooke was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, where his father
taught classics and was a housemaster at Rugby School. In his childhood
Brooke immersed himself in English poetry and twice won the school
poetry prize. While at King's college, Cambridge, he became friends
with G.E. Moore, Lytton Strachey, Maynard Keynes, Roger Fry, and
Leonard Fry, members of the future Bloomsbury Group. Brooke's father
died suddenly in 1910. For a short time he was in Rugby a deputy
housemaster and thereafter he lived on an allowance from his mother. In
1911 he worked on a thesis on the playwright John Webster and the
Elizabethan drama, and travelled in Germany and Italy. On the
contemporary literary scene he was know as a leader of a group of young
"Neo-pagans", who slept outdoors, embraced a religion of nature, and
swam naked &#8211; Virginia Woolf joined the swimmers in Grantchester. </p>
<p>However, sex was something that was not part of the fun &#8211; "We don't
copulate without marriage, but we do meet in cafes, talk on buses, go
on unchaperoned walks, stay with each other, give each other books,
without marriage," Brooke once told to his friend. Virginia Woolf wrote
later: "So much has been written of his personal beauty that to state
one's own first impression of him in that respect needs some audacity,
since the first impression was of a type so conventionally handsome and
English as to make it inexpressive or expressive only of something that
one might be inclined half-humorously to disparage. He was the type of
English young manhood at its healthiest and most vigorous. Perhaps at
the particular stage he had then reached, following upon the decadent
phase of his first Cambridge days, he emphasized this purposely: he was
consciously and defiantly pagan." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Books and Portraits</font></i><font size="2"> by Virginia Woolf, ed. by Mary Lyon, 1977)</font><i></i></p>
<p>Brooke's first collection of verse, <span style="font-style: italic;">Poems</span>, came out in 1911. His work was featured in the periodical <i>Georgian Poetry</i>,
edited by his friend, Sir Edward Marsh. Over the next twenty years, the
book sold almost 100 000 copies. Brooke assembled with others the
hugely successful anthology <i>Georgian Poetry: 1911-1912</i>.
Geogians was a term generally applied to loosely linked poets, who
tended to approach their subjects &#8211; often the nature or an everyday
experience &#8211; with a direct, simple diction. Specifially the label
refers to the poets included in the five volume anthology <i>Georgian Poetry </i>(1912-22). Clere Parsons (1908-31) rejected their work as "the swan-song of Victorian poetry" in 'A Plea For Better Criticism<font size="2">' (preface in </font><i><font size="2">Oxford Poetry</font></i><font size="2">,</font><i> </i><font size="2">1928). </font>Critics near the <a href="vwoolf.htm">Bloomsbury group</a>  accused the group of naivety; Brooke broke with Bloomsbury in 1912.  </p>
<p>In 1911 Brooke was secretly engaged to Noel Olivier, five years his
junior, the daughter of Sir Sydney Olivier. They had first met in 1908
at a Fabian Society dinner in Cambridge. The affair was for all
participants frustrating and subsequently Brooke had an affair with the
actress Cathleen Nesbitt. Overworked and emotionally empty, Brooke
suffered a nervous breakdown. In the spring of 1912, Brooke and
Katharine Cox went to Germany, where he wrote 'The Old Vicarage,
Grantchester', one of his most admired poems. It has been assumed that
Ka Cox bore Brooke's stillborn child. In England Brooke's thesis
brought him a fellowship at King's College in 1913. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Say, is there Beauty yet to find? </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And Certainty? and Quiet kind? </font><br>
<font size="2">Deep meadows yet, for to forget </font><br>
<font size="2">The lies, and truths, and pain? ... Oh! yet </font><br>
<font size="2">Stands the Church clock at ten to three? </font><br>
<font size="2">And is there honey still for tea?</font><font size="2">"
</font></b><font size="2"> </font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'The Old Vicarege, Grantchester', 1912) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the years 1913 and 1914 Brooke spent wandering in North America and the South Seas, and depicted the impressions in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Letters fron America</span> (1916). <a href="hjames.htm">Henry James</a>'s
introduction to it was completely slashed by A.C. Benson: "After all
H.J.'s pontification, R.B.'s robust letters are almost a shock. It is
as if one went up to receive a sacrament in a great, dark church, and
were greeted by shouts of laughter and shower of chocolate creams."
Brooke spent three months on Tahiti, wrote some of his finest poems,
and had an affair with a woman called Taatamata, commemorated in 'Tiare
Tahiti'. In 1914 Brooke became friends with Winston Churchill and the
Asquith family. </p>
<p>The outbreak of World War I interrupted Brooke's career as a writer.
He was commissioned in Churchill's Royal Navy Division, and joined the
Dardanelles expedition. Brooke did not see any action. He died of
septicemia as a result of a mosquito bite &#8211; or according to some
sources of food poisoning &#8211; on
a hospital ship off Scyros on April 23, 1915. Brooke was buried on the
island. Henry James mourned Brooke's early death and the poet's legend
was further solidified when Winston Churchill produced his own
contribution to it with an obituary text. </p>
<p>Brooke's appeal began to wane after the acrid poems of Wilfred Owen
(1893-1918), who was machine-gunned to death, and Siegfried Sassoon's
visions of "the hell where youth and laugher go". In France as a
by-product of the war, writers returning home from the trenches created
such artistic and literary movements as Dada and Surrealism and in
England T.S. Eliot expressed his feeling of meaningless in <i>The Waste Land</i>.
Brooke's chivalry was permanently outdated. He never lived to see the
end of the war, and his poetic stature was frozen for a long period in
such lines as "Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead! / There's none
of these so lonely and poor of old, / But, dying, has made us rarer
gifts than gold."<font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">1914 and Other Poems</font></i><font size="2">, 1915) </font>Nowadays
Brooke is chiefly valued for his lighter verse, for the Tahiti poems,
and for a few sonnets. James Strachey, a friend from childhood on, once
said: "Rupert wasn't nearly so nice as people now imagine; but he was a
great deal cleverer." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Friends and Apostles: The Correspondence of Rupert Brooke and James Strachey 1905-1914</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Keith Hale; 1998) </font></p>
