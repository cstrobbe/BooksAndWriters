<P>Nigerian poet who wrote in English. Okigbo died in the civil war in Nigeria, fighting for the independence of Biafra. His difficult but suggestive and prophetic poems show the influence of modernist European and American poetry, African tribal mythology, and Nigerian music and rhythms. &quot;Prophetic, menacing, terrorist, violent, protesting &#150; his poetry was all of these,&quot; S.O. Anozie said in <I>Christopher Okigbo: Creative Rhetoric </I>(1972). </P>

<P>Christopher Okigbo was born in Ojoto in eastern Nigeria, which at that time was still Britain's colony. 
He was the fourth child of James Okigbo, a primary-school teacher, and 
Anna Onugwalobi, daughter of Ikejiofor, priest of the Ajani shrine of Ire, Ojoto. 
James was a Roman Catholic convert, who taught in many new mission schools. Anna achieve great success in trading
clothes and jewelry; she died in 1935, and James married Elizabeth, Okigbo's step-mother. His early education 
Okigbo received at Umulobia Catholic School. 
In 1945 he went for his secondary education to Umuahia Government College. Like many other major Nigerian writers, 
such as Wole Soyinka, Elechi Amadi, John Pepper Clark, and Cole Omotso, he also entered the  University College of Ibadan. 
Okigbo first planned to study medicine, but changed his major to  Greek and Latin, graduating in 1956.  
He edited the <I>University Weekly </I>and translated Greek and Latin Verse. 
From the university days on he was a close friend of <A HREF="achebe">Chinua Achebe</A>. </P>
<P>Okigbo  tried first to start a career  at the Nigerian Tobacco Company and the United African Company, 
but he never turned his fascination with big business into a money making enterprise. 
Between 1957 and 1958 he served as private secretary to the Federal Minister of Information 
in Lagos.  On his first visit to the United States, 
Okigbo was involved in negotiations which led to the establishment of the Nigerian Mission in the United Nations in New York. 
However, Okigbo had little patience with bureaucracy, and he failed to secure a position in the Foreign Service. &quot;Chris always 
struck one to be in the wrong place in those years,&quot; one of his colleagues recalled. &quot;He had an amazing energy, 
a brilliant and acute mind and a real capacity to generate laughter.&quot;  
Before taking a job as   the West Africa representantive for Cambridge University Press in 1961, 
Okigbo was employed  as a teacher at Fiditi Grammar School, near Ibadan, and then as Assistant Librarian at 
the  University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he participated in the founding of the African Authors 
Association. 
</P>
<P>In Ibadan, Okigbo became a central figure of the Mbari Club.
 In the 1960s, this diverse and cosmopolitan city, largest in West Africa, 
was a haven for scholars, intellectuals, political exiles, artists, writers and bohemians.  
&quot;Ibadan was a huge village and lived at the leisurely pace of the village; avoided 
the speed and neuroses of the city,&quot; wrote Nkem Nwankwo in his book of memoir <I>Shadow 
of the Masquerade</I> (1994). &quot;That meant that life was easy and everything &#150; 
especially sexual gratification &#150; was available with minimum effort, at minimum cost.&quot; 
The great love of Okigbo's life was Judith Safinat Attah, an Igbira princess, the 
daughter of one of the most powerful monarchs in Northern Nigeria. They eventually married, but he 
did not give up his Bohemian ways, and turned her back to Yola in the North of Nigeria, if she came 
to see him without informing beforehand. To a friend Okigbo confessed, that he could not 
imagine living in the same house with a woman as his wife. When his daughter 
was born in 1964, Okigbo wrote the poem, 'Dance of the Painted 
Maidens' in celebration of her birth. </P>

<P>Okigbo published his first poems in the student literary journal <I>Horn,</I> which was edited by J.P. Clark. As a poet Okigbo made his breakthrough  in 1962, when his works appeared in the literary magazine <I>Black Orpheus</I>. In the same year he also published pamphlet, entitled <I>Heavensgate</I>, and a long poem in the Ugandan cultural magazine <I>Transition</I>, which was published in Kampala. Okigbo's early poems reflected the divided cultural heritage of his country, although first influences from Virgil, Ovid, Eliot, and Pound seem to be stronger than the oral literature of the Igbo. He knew Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' by heart, as well as Shelley's 'Ozymandias'. <I>Heavensgate</I> marked his return to the African part of his heritage and self-renewal through the goddess of the earth: &quot;Before you, mother Idoto, naked I stand / before your watery presence a prodigal / leaning on an oilbean  / lost in your legend&quot;. </P>
<P>The 1960s was a period of great political upheavals in Nigeria. The country became an independent republic in 1963 and four years later the eastern Ibo tribal region attempted to secede as the independent nation of Biafra. Although Okigbo followed keenly the social and political events in his country, his early poems moved on a personal and mythical level. <I>Path of Thunder </I>(1968) showed a new direction &#150;  its attack on bloodthirsty politicians (&quot;POLITICIANS are back in giant hidden steps of howitzers, / of detonators&quot;) and neocolonial exploitation (&quot;THE ROBBERS descend on us to strip us our laughter, of our / thunder&quot;) was also in tune with the rise of radical movements of the decade. Okigbo won in 1966 the poetry prize at the Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal, but he refused the prize because he did not believe that art should not be judged on racial basis. At the outbreak of the civil war Okigbo was working for an Italian business organization called Wartrade. With Chinua Achebe he founded a publishing company Citadell Press at Enugu. </P>
<P>Okigbo joined in July 1967 the Biafran army as a major, refuring more secure posts behind the lines. He was killed in action  near Nsukka in August,  in one of the first battles of the civil war. He was posthumously decorated with the Biafran National Order of Merit.  The poems Okigbo wished to preserve were published posthumously by Heinemann as <I>Labyrinths</I> in 1971, with <I>Path of Thunder</I>, added. Okigbo left behind a wife and daughter, for whom he dedicated <I>Labyriths</I>. Forebodingly he had written in  'Elegy for Alto:'   &quot;O mother mother Earth, unbind me; let this be / my last testament, let this be / The ram's hidden wish to the sword the sword's / secret prayer to the scabbard &#150;.&quot; According to some sources, Okigbo was working on a novel before his death, but the manuscript has not been found. The tragic hero Chris Oriko in Achebe's novel <I>Anthills of the Savannah</I> (1987) was modelled after Okigbo. Achebe and Dubem Okafor edited a volume of poems,<I> Don't Let Him Die </I>(1978), which commemorated the life and poetry of Okigbo. </P>
<P>Okigbo used often repetition, the rhythm  is songlike, and the words flow melodiously, as if the poet were listening and interpreting distant sounds. In  an interview he  said that he stopped writing music when he began  writing poetry seriously. Once he accompanied Wole Soyinka on the piano in his first public appearance as a singer, playing 'Amabola'. He also accompanied Fransisca Pereira. Nothing has survived of his written music. Okigbo occasionally portrayed himself as a singer-musician, who speaks with the ancient, pre-literate language of drums: &quot;I have fed out of the drum / I have drunk out of the cymbal...&quot; Recurring images are dance (&quot;dance of death&quot;, &quot;iron dance of mortars&quot;), thunder (&quot;thunder of tanks&quot;, &quot;the thunder among the clouds&quot;), and the sound of drums (&quot;the drums of curfew&quot;, &quot;lament of the drums&quot;). In 'Overture' (1961) Okigbo was a &quot;watchman for the watchword / at heavensgate&quot; and in 'Hurrah for Thunder' a &quot;town-crier, together with my iron bell&quot; (from<I> Paths of Thunder</I>, 1968). With <A HREF="tseliot.htm">T.S. Eliot</A> he shared a vision of a spiritual quest, which takes the poet to the realm of ancient myths and to his spiritual self.  From the four elements Okigbo chose water, the dwelling place of Idoto: &quot;Under my feet float the waters: / tide blows them under.&quot;</P>
