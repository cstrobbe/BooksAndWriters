<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->German poet and dramatist, who became a spokesperson
for her fellow Jews of experiences in the Nazi death camps. In 1966 Nelly Sachs 
shared the Nobel Prize for Literature with the novelist <a href="agnon.htm">S.Y. Agnon</a>. Sachs spent the rest of her life in Sweden after escaping from Germany in 1940. </p>

<p>Leonie Sachs, better known as Nelly Sachs, was born in Berlin into a
middle-class Jewish family. She was the only child of the inventor and
industrialist William Sachs and Margareta (Karger) Sachs. The family
was religiously liberal and cultured and considered itself wholly at
home in Germany. They belonged to the Berlin Jewish community, but did
not celebrate Jewish holidays. Sachs did not read and write Hebrew and
she did not speak Yiddish. </p>
<p>Before entering the Berliner Höhere Töchterschule, Sachs was
educated by a private teacher and she also received instructions in
Judaism. Sachs studied music, dance, and literature. At one time she
planned to become a dancer. According to Sachs, she felt herself
lonely, but she also had a close friend, Dora, and even shared an art
studio with her in Berlin. </p><p>At the age of 15, after reading <a href="lagerlof.htm">Selma Lagerlöf</a>'s <i>Gösta Berling</i>,
she started a correspondence with the famous Swedish author. Her
contact with Lagerlöf lasted some 35 years. Sachs began writing verse
as a young girl, and eventually her work attracted the attention of the
Austrian writer <a href="szweig.htm">Stefan Zweig</a>, who arranged
for the publication one of her poems. Sachs had read widely German
Romantic writers &#8211; Goethe and Friedrich Schiller &#8211; and these slightly
melancholic early poems reflected the influence of neoromantic
tradition. However, later Sachs excluded these youthful productions
from her collected works. Her first book was <em>Legenden und Erzählungen</em>
(1921), a collection of stories inspired by the figures of Jesus and St
Francis. Most of her work written before exile she lost or destroyed. </p>
<p>Sachs lived in comfortable circumstances in a quiet district of
Berlin. During the 1920s and 1930s Sachs's lyrical works appeared in
newspapers and magazines, but she never became a visible part of the
literary scene of the city. Between 1937 and 1939 she published in
Jewish magazines only. In the late 1930s&nbsp;Sachs joined the Jüdische
Kulturbund (the Jewish Culture Association), which was
established&nbsp;to allow Jewish artists to perform for Jewish
audiences. </p>
<p>After her father died of cancer in 1930, Sachs lived with her
mother. The Nazis seized power in 1933 and Sachs' life became even more
recluse. She was arrested in 1937 with a close friend, who was active
in the Resistance; Sachs never revealed the identity of her friend. "My
fate was to be alone, like the fate of my people," Sachs once said. In
1939 she and her mother were required&nbsp; to take the middle name
Sarah, as all Jewish women had to.<strong> </strong>With the&nbsp;help
of Gudrun Harlan and Selma Lagerlöf, the Sachs fled to Sweden&nbsp;in
1940, leaving all of their belongings behind. Sachs had only one small
suitcase and ten Deutschmark in her pocket. Lagerlöf, &nbsp;her most
important literary contact in Sweden, had died&nbsp; by the time they
arrived. </p><p>Sachs managed to escape the forced labour camp but
other members of her family died in the Holocaust. It was not until
1960 when she visited Germany, to receive the Droste-Hülshoff Prize. In
her new home country, Sachs learned Swedish and supported herself and
her mother by translating into German works from such Swedish poets as
Gunnar Ekelöf, Erik Lindegren, and Johannes Edfelt. She also became a
Swedish citizen in 1952. </p><p>Sachs&nbsp;wrote her most famous works in the 1940s, beginning from the poem cycles<em> '</em>Grabschriften in die Luft geschrieben' (1944, Epitaphs written into the Air), '<span class="st">Gebete für den toten Bräutigam' (Prayers for a Dead Bridegroom)</span>, and <em>Eli, ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels</em>
(1945-46, Eli: A Mystery Play of the Sufferings of Israel ), published
in 1951 in Malmö.&nbsp;The&nbsp;play&nbsp;was printed in 200 hand
signed copies. Sachs's mother died in February 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
loss brought&nbsp;Sachs to a serious psychological crisis,&nbsp;from
which she found an escape in&nbsp;Jewish mysticism. In the early 1960s,
Sachs<strong> </strong>spent time in a psychiatric hospital. She had
heard loud noises, a motor run all night long in the above apartment,
and she could not get any sleep. She weighted only 36 kilos. Curiously,
according to a document, she was 154 cm tall when she had arrived
Sweden, but in her Swedish passport her height was written as 148 cm.
At the Beckomberga Mental Hospital she was given shock therapy. With
electric shocks she was treated about 15 times. <br>
</p><p>During the postwar years, Sachs read Martin Buber's
Hasidic&nbsp;tales and the Bible. With Lenke Rothman, a Hungarian-born
Swedish artists, she studied Kabbala in German&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp; Lenke
Rothman had learned German in Auschwitz.&nbsp; As a gift from a rabbi
of the Great Synagogue in Stockholm, she received the Gershom Scholem's
translation of the first chapter of the <em>Zohar</em>, <em>Die Geheimnisse der Schöpfund von Sholem. </em>This<em> </em>cabalistic work, originally &nbsp;written in Aramaic, influenced her deeply. </p><p>In 1954&nbsp;Sachs started a correspondence with <a href="celan.htm">Paul Celan</a>.
"There is and was in me, and it's there with every breath I draw," she
wrote in a letter, "the belief in transcendence through suffusion with
pain, in the inspiritment of dust, as a vocation to which we are
called." Sachs also visited the Celan family in Paris in 1960 and laid
with him flowers on Heine's grave. Both Sachs and Celan shared the
conviction that the sole reason for their being lay in language. "Only
one thing remained reachable, close and secure amid all losses:
language," Celan once said. Sachs's <em>Heimat</em> was in her written words. Celan also visited her in 1960 in Stockholm when she was hospitalized. <br>
 </p>
<p><em>Sternverdunklung </em>(1949) had a great reception but sold
poorly and&nbsp;&nbsp;the publisher, Bermann-Fischer Publishing
House,&nbsp;destroyed most of the copies. "It is a rough climate to be
in exile! Believe me, Peter, it demands courage, courage again and
again," she wrote to Peter Hamm in 1958. After years of isolation,
Sachs started to gain an international fame. In 1960 she received the
Droste-Hülshoff Prize and in 1965 the Peace Prize of the German Book
Trade. Accepting the award, she said, "In spite of all the horrors of
the past, I believe in you." Scholarly interest in her work began in
1970 with the appearance of three dissertations </p>
<p>Sachs saw victims as part of eternal metamorphosis and in her work she returned especially in the fate of Job. In the collection<em> In den Wohnungen des Todes </em>(1947)
the central motifs were flight and pursuit, the symbols of the hunter
and his quarry. The protagonist of 'Gebete für den toten Bräutigan' was
the unnamed man, with whom she fell in love in her youth and who was
murdered by the Nazis.<em>&nbsp;Eli, ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels</em>&nbsp;
depicted the tragedy of an 8-year-old Polish boy, his death, and the
search for his murderer. The work was later presented as a radio play
and an opera. </p>
<p><em>Flucht und Verwandlung</em> (1959)&nbsp;established Sachs as an
outstanding writer in German literature. In it Sachs developed her
visions of metamorphosis and exile of human beings on earth. After
receiving the Nobel Prize, Sachs continued to live modestly in her
small dwelling. The house where she lived, part of an apartment block
in a district of workers and petits bourgeois,&nbsp;was owned by the
Jewish community of Stockholm. She wrote with an old-fashioned
Mercedes Prima typewriter, placed on a little table and sitting at the edge of her
bed. </p><p>Sachs never married; her only significant romantic affair,
with a non-Jewish man, ended in disappointment; her father supposedly
did not approve him. After her father's death, she met him again and
possibly continued the relatioship. According to some sources he died
in a concentration camp. Sachs dedicted <em>Prayers for a Dead Bridegroom</em> to him in an anthology published in 1947. Her private life Sachs kept to herself. </p><p>Sachs
died of cancer on May 12, 1970, and was buried in the Jewish
cemetery.&nbsp;By the time of her death, her work had been translated
into fifteen languages. In her final published work, <em>Die Suchende</em>
(1971), Sachs&nbsp;tried to find a balance between her
German&nbsp;upbringing and her&nbsp;identity as a Jewish writer living
in exile. Her tiny apartment has been reassembled at the National
Library of Sweden.&nbsp;
</p><p>Recurrent images in&nbsp;Sachs' poetry are stars, dust, sand, as in the collection <em>Zeichen im Sand</em>
(1962). She spoke with the rhythm of prophets and lifted the sufferings
into a timeless plane, continuing the tradition of psalmists and
prophets. In <i>O The Chimneys</i> (1967) the Jewish nation is
represented as smoke drifting from concentration camp chimneys, a way
to freedom between life and death. Sachs rarely breaks loose her rage
like Primo Levi in his poem 'Shemá', but transcends the tragedy of the
Jewish people and her apocalyptic vision and conveys a message of
reconciliation and resurrection. </p>
