      <p>Austrian/British writer of art, the author of <i>The Story of
Art</i> (1950), which has been translated into some 20 languages.
Originally the work was intended for teen-agers, but due to its
insights and superb style, it was soon accepted by universities as a
textbook. Gombrich also&nbsp;wrote studies in the art of the
Renaissance and on the psychology of pictorial representation. His<i>
Art and Illusion</i> (1960) was listed by Sir Hugh Trevor-Roper as one
of five or six greatest and most influential books published in the
late 20th-century. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Indeed, the true miracle of the
language of art is not that it enables the artist to create the
illusion of reality. It is that under the hands of a great master the
image becomes translucent. In teaching us to see the visible world
afresh, he gives us the illusion of looking into the invisible realms
of the mind - if only we know, as Philostratus says, how to use our
eyes."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Art and Illusion</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Ernst Gombrich was born in Vienna, the son of Dr. Karl B.
Gombrich, a lawyer, and Professor Leonia (née Hock) Gombrich. He grew
up in cultured, musical surroundings. His mother was a pianist, who had
been taught by Bruckner. Her friends and acquaintances included Freud,
who told Jewish anecdotes, the composer Gustav Mahler, Schoenberg, and
the violinist Adolf Busch. Gombrich himself played cello. Both of his parents were of Jewish origin,
but religion did not play central role in the family. Under the scheme
arranged by the Save the Children Fund, Gombrich was sent after World
War I to Sweden, where he&nbsp;lived with his sister Lisbeth with a
coffin-maker for nine months. </p>
      <p>After returning back to Austria,&nbsp;Gombrich entered the
Theresianum, a conservative school concentrating on classics. From 1928
to 1935 he studied history of art and archaeology at the University of
Vienna, where Alois Riegl's legacy of formalism was reshaped with the
insights of Gestalt psychology.&nbsp; Gombrich also attended lectures
on psychology and philosophy. At that time the Vienna Circle of
philosophers, led by Moritz Schlick, produced their most important
works. The Circle also inspired such thinkers as Michael Polanyi,
Friedrich von Hayek, Karl Popper and Gombrich, who came to prominence
after the rise of the Nazis caused them to flee to the West. Gombrich's
dissertation examined the architecture of the 16th-century artist
Giulio Romano. With Ernst Kris, a friend of Freud, he collabotated on a
book on the history of caricature &#8211; the work was published in an
abbreviated version in 1940. </p>
      <p>Gombrich married Ilse Heller, pupil of her mother.&nbsp;Their
only son, Richard Francis Gombrich, became an Indologist&nbsp;and one
of the world's best known scholars on Buddhism. Gombrich's first book, <em>Weltgeschichte
von der Urzeit bis zur Gegenwart</em> (1936, A Little History of the
World), which he wrote in Vienna under great time pressure, was
dedicated to his wife.&nbsp;The history primer for children was a
popular success but the Nazis considered it "too pacifist" and
stopped&nbsp;the further publication.&nbsp;"But what you must never
forget is the importance for our own lives of tolerance, reason and
humanity &#8211;&nbsp;the three findamental principles of the Enlightenment",
Gombrich&nbsp;stressed to his readers. When he revised the book for its
50th anniversary, Gombrich added a new chapter in 1985, entitled 'The
Small Part of the History of the World Which I Have Lived Through
Myself,'&nbsp; to the original 39 chapters. This book, his only one
written in German, did not appear in English until 2005. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1936 Gombrich was employed&nbsp;as a staff member of the
Warburg Institute, which had emigrated from Hamburg to London. Most of
his family members, who remained in Austria, were killed after
"Anschluss," the 1938 Union of Austria with Nazi Germany. Gombrich also
wrote an intellectual&nbsp;biography of Aby Warburg (1866-1929), the
founder of the Institute, who was cultural historian and especially
interested in the survival and transformations of the classical
traditions. This line of research marked Gombrich's studies in the art
of Renaissance, too. Warburg had build an unique collection of books,
and its resources attracted exiled European scholars. However, as
innovative as Warburg's anthropological&nbsp; study of art had been in
its time, Gombrich brought to light its racialist overtones:&nbsp;"A
convinced evolutionist he saw in the Indians of New Mexico a stage of
civilization which corresponded to the phase of paganism ancient Greece
left behind with dawn of rationalism." </p>
      <p>During
World War II Gombrich served at the Monitoring Service
of the BBC. He interpreted German radio broadcasts, looking for hidden
meanings from propaganda. Gombrich witnessed the war, as he said, "not
only through the British news media and the realities of life
'somewhere in the country', as the formula was, but also through the
distorting mirror in which Goebbels wanted the German people to see
it." At the end of the war, when Hitler committed suicide, Gombrich was
the first to carry the news to Prime Minister Winston Churchill. To
this period he returned in <span style="font-style: italic;">Myth
and Reality in German War-Time Broadcasts</span> (1970). <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1947 Gombrich became naturalized British citizen. From 1959
to 1959 he was Durning-Lawrence Professor of the History of Art at
University College. In 1959 he was Unity Professor of Fine Art at
Harvard, and became in the same year Director of the Warburg Institute
and Professor of the History of the Classical Tradition at the
University of London, serving there until his retirement in 1976. In
1968-69 he was Lethaby Professor at the Royal College of Art, and in
1970 Andrew D. White professor-at-large at Cornell. Gombrich received a
CBE in 1966 and was knighted in 1972. </p>
      <p>Ernst Gombrich died on November 3, 2001 in London. Shortly
before his death, Gombrich completed <i style="font-style: italic;">The
Preference for the Primitive</i> (2002). "Gombrich is always worth
reading even if some of his betes noires, like the concept of the
"Zeitgeist," have now passed onto the compost heap of history," said
Bruce Boucher in the <i>New York Times<font size="2"> </font></i><font size="2">(September 1, 2002)</font>. </p>
      <p>In <i>Art and Illusion</i> Gombrich explored the links
between perception and art. The work was partly based on the A.W.
Mellon Lectures he gave in the spring of 1956, entitled 'The Visible
World and the Language of Art'. Gombrich dealt with such questions as
the imitation of nature, the function of tradition, the validity of
perspective and the interpretation of expression. He argued challenging
that no artist can copy what he or she sees: "The artist cannot copy a
sunlit lawn, but he can suggest it." To describe reality an artist
needs a medium and a schema, a vocabulary, which can be modified. A
painter doesn't examine the nature of the physical world but the nature
of our reactions to it. Foreshortening produces the impression of
depth, other keys to the mind of a beholder are for example the tonal
system of modelling and highlights for texture. </p>
      <p>Gombrich supposes that Leonardo da Vinci's dissatisfaction
with his art was due to his realization that "all the artist's
knowledge and inanimation are of no avail, it is only a picture that he
has been painting, and it will lock flat." Like <a href="wolfflin.htm">Heinrich
Wölfflin</a>, he believed that all&nbsp;pictures owe more to other
pictures than they do to the nature. Throughout history artists have
learned more from tradition, studying other paintings, making
discoveries of appearances, than making direct and careful observations
of the world around them. Thus the history of representational art
follows piecemeal inventions of pictorial effects.</p>
      <p>Gombrich compares the long history of visual discoveries to
learning by trial and error. 'Reading' an image also needs training, it
is not automatic. Gombrich quotes Ruskin who said that "the truth of
nature is not to be discerned by the uneducated senses". When the
painter's skill in suggesting is matched by the public's skill in
taking hints, a two-dimensional colored canvas turns into a landscape,
and the enormous gulf between picture and the visible three-dimensional
world is crossed. Gombrich considers cubism the most radical attempt to
reveal the mechanisms of an illusionist reading by introducing contrary
clues which resist all attempts to see in a painting three-dimensional
objects. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Images apparently occupy a curious
position somewhere between the statements of language, which are
intended to convey a meaning, and the things of nature, to which we
only can give a meaning. At the unveiling of the Piccadilly fountain
one of the speakers called it 'a remarkably suitable memorial to Lord
Shafterbury, for it is always giving water to rich and poor alike...'.
It was an easy, indeed a somewhat trite comparison to make; nobody
would infer from it that fountains mean philanthropy - quite apart from
the fact that giving to the rich would not fall under this concept."</b>
(from</font><i><font size="2"> Symbolic Images</font></i><font size="2">,
1972) </font></blockquote>
      <p><i>Meditations on a Hobby Horse </i>(1963) was a volume of
lectures and essays on a wide range of subjects, from the writings of
André Malraux to the art of the cartoonist. Gombrich's <i>Norm and Form</i>
(1966) was devoted to problems of style, patronage and taste in the
Italian Renaissance. The learned work was not intended for the general
reader. His Wrightsman Lectures were published as <i>A Sense of Order</i>
(1979), a study of decorative art. </p>
      <p><i>Symbolic Images</i> (1972) brought together Gombrich's
essays on Botticelli, Mantegna, Raphael, Giulio Romano, and Nicolas
Poussin. In this work the interest was in mythological, astrological,
allegorical and theological themes in Renaissance art. Gombrich
suggests that it was Apuleius' tale in the <i>Golden Ass</i> &#8211; not
Poliziano's poem in <i>the Giostra</i> &#8211; which served as a source for
Botticelli's famous painting the 'Primavera'. The painting has puzzled
generations of art lovers. Gombrich's hypothesis was rejected by <a href="panof.htm">Erwin Panofsky</a>, a member of the circle around Aby
Warburg. Warburg himself had tried in his doctoral thesis to establish
a connection between Poliziano's <i>stanze</i> and the 'Primavera'.
When the essay was reprinted nearly 25 years after it appearance in <i>Symbolic
Images</i>, Gombrich expressed some reservations about it: "However
much I stressed the hypothetical character of this connection with
Apuleius, I did not help matters by suggesting the possibility that the
programme may have rested on a misunderstanding of the text." </p>
      <p>Gombrich's work show the influence of the philosopher Karl
Popper, who was his close friend, and with whom he shared a hostility
to vague thinking. Also <a href="kohler.htm">Wolfgang Köhler</a>'s
studies in perceptual psychology left traces in Gombrich's thinking. In
      <i>Art and Illusion </i>he gives the full credit to Popper in
his rejection of the "bucket theory of the mind"' and emphasizing the
activity of the living organism that never ceases probing and testing
its environment. "There is no rigid distinction, therefore, between
perception and illusion", Gombrich writes. Popper himself said that
Gombrich had made "a more imaginative and better-informed application
of his ideas to art than anything he could have done himself." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Confession of a Philosopher</font></i><font size="2"> by Bryan Magee, 1997) </font></p>

History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods</em> by Michael Hatt
and Charlotte Klonk (2006) &nbsp;- <b>Note</b>: In the introduction of
        <i>Art and Illusion</i> Gombrich deals with visually ambiguous
figures familiar from psychology textbooks. His own example is the
duck-rabbit figure&nbsp;&#8211; the Necker cube and reversible staircase are
similar much used examples. We see the figure sometimes as a rabbit,
sometimes as a duck, but never both ways simultaneously. Gombrich
concludes that to see the shape apart from its interpretation is not
possible. Philosophically, as G.L. Hagberg points out in <i>Art as
Language</i> (1995), this can generate the idea of radically
incommensurable world views, each carrying its own internally generated
criteria for verification and certainty. Richard Wollheim criticizes in
        <i>Art and Its Object</i> (1980) Gombrich's central
thesis&nbsp;&#8211; that in looking at representational
pictures,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are incapable of seeing the medium and the
object at the same time&nbsp;&#8211; in Gombrich "seeing canvas" / "seeing
nature" disjunction. Wollheim defends his "twofold" thesis with several
arguments, stating among others that <b>"in Titian, in Vermeer, in
Manet we are led to marvel endlessly at the way in which line or
brushstroke or expanse of color is exploited to render effects or
establish analogies that can only be identified representationally, and
the argument is that this virtue could not have received recognition
if, in looking at pictures, we had to alternate visual attention
between the material features and the object of the representation." </b></font></blockquote>
