<P>German sculptor, illustrator, and playwright, whose art was condemned by the Nazis as "degenerate" and presented in the exhibition <I>Entartete Kunst</I>. In it Ernst Barlach's statue The Reunion, which showed the recognition of Christ by Saint Thomas was labelled "Two Monkeys in Nightshirts." Like many Expressionist artist&nbsp;– Oskar Kokoschka, Ludwig Meidner, Walter Hasenclever, Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg etc.&nbsp;– Barlach was active in more than one medium of expression. In his woodcarvings Barlach combined influences from the Late German Gothic art with archaic power, angst and spiritualism. "Mythic observation is to me the foundation of all art," Barlach once stated. His reputation as a dramatist rests mainly on his later plays, <I>Die Echten Sedemunds</I> (1920, The Genuine Sedemunds), <I>Die S&uuml;ndflut</I> (1924, The Flood) and<I> Der blaue Boll</I> (1926, The Blue Boll). </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"... Barlach deliberately rejected the clerical tradition in favour of the Gothic or Nordic tradition. In some degree this brings him nearer to Rodin with his admiration for the image-makers of the Middle Ages, but Rodin was sensitive enough to feel the classical element in mature Gothic..." </B>(Herbert Read in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>A Concise History of Modern Sculpture</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1964) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ernst Barlach was born in Wede, Holsteinl. His father, who was a country physician, died when Barlach was fourteen. His subsequent education was irregular, but in 1888 he entered the Hamburg School of Arts and Crafts. From 1891 to 1895 he studied sculpture and design at the Dresden Academy of Arts. In 1895 he went to Paris, where he studied at the Academie Julian in 1895-96, and worked as a sculptor. </P><P>After his Paris days, Barlach traveled extensively. He lived in Hamburg, Berlin, and many other German cities. From 1898 to 1902 he worked for <I>Jugend</I> magazine and from 1901 to 1905 he designed ceramics for the Muntz factory in Wedel. During this period he became friends with the publisher Reinhard Piper; his correspondence with Piper appeared in 1997. Another important supporter was the art dealer Paul Cassirer, who also helped Oskar Kokoschka. </P>
<P>In 1904 Barlach taught at H&ouml;r School of Ceramics in Westerwald. Barlach's journey across the Russian steppes with his brother in 1906 and the birth of his illegitimate son became a turning point in his career. Among the peasants of Russia he saw "Christian humility toward all things" and he started to read the works of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. </P><P>Barlach's drawings and sculptures on Russian beggar women belong to his most famous works, which interlinked material and spiritual needs of human beings. His characters are solid, reduced into their essential broad geometrical forms, and their eyes are often closed or half-closed. Sometimes the facial expressions are primitive, sometimes grotesque or touchingly comic. Alone, without any reference to surroundings, Barlach's self-absorbed figures seem to exemplify loneliness and helplessness in front of divine mysteries. Art became for Barlach an expression of a spiritual search for God, inner self, and other human beings. </P>
<P>From 1907 to 1908 Barlach was an illustrator of the satirical magazine <I>Simplicissimus</I>. After spending some time in Florence Barlach settled with his son in 1910 in G&uuml;strow, an old Mecklenburg town known for its cathedral. When World War I broke out, Barlach first greeted it with patriotic enthusiasm. He had a very short military training, and after he was exempted from military service he worked in an orphanage. <I>G&uuml;strower Tagebuch</I> (1980) reflected his thoughts of the horrors of the ongoing war. Barlach's mother, who had suffered from depression, committed suicide in 1920. In the mid-1920s, Barlach met Marga B&ouml;hmer who became his life companion. The rest of his life Barlach spent in G&uuml;strow, in solitude and almost complete seclusion. Barlach died on October 24, 1938 in a Rostock hospital. He was buried near his father in Ratzeburg.</P>
<P>Barlach's first play,<I> Der Tote Tag</I>, was published in 1912 with 27 lithographic illustrations. It was an allegory of a mother and son who live in a vast hall in perpetual twilight. The son tries unsuccessfully to break away from his mother. His quest for his paternal spirit becomes also his search for God in the world outside. Eventually the mother commits suicide, and then the son. The play introduced some of Barlach's favorite themes&nbsp;– the tension between physical world and spiritual struggle, mysticism and realism, suicide, and the special father-son relationship. <I>Der blaue Boll</I> is generally regarded as one of Barlach's best dramas. The central character is Squire Boll, a robust country gentleman and hedonist, who contemplates suicide. His fate to struggle and suffer is linked to Grete Greendale, who contemplates the murder of her children in order to transform them into pure spirit. </P>
<P>By 1920s, Baclach was considered one of the leading expressionist sculptors of the country. He became in 1919 a member of the Prussian Art Academy, and in 1924 Barlach received the Kleist Price for Drama. In 1933 he was awarded the Prussian Order of Merit. Barlach received a commission in 1930 to execute a large war memorial at the Magdeburg Cathedral. His monumental works aroused much controversy, and after the Nazis had obtained power Barlach's work was seen as subversive. Hitler denounced in a speech in Nuremberg "the spoilers of art who belong in an insane asylum or a prison." Artist were told to produce art, which would be understood even by the "lowliest storm-trooper." However, before the speech Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, had shown some sympathy for people like Barlach and Emil Nolde (1867-1956), known for his expressionistically distorted paintings. Barlach described Hitler on radio as "the lurking destroyer of others" and called National Socialism "the secret death of mankind". <FONT size=2>(see </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Hitler and the Artists </FONT></I><FONT size=2>by Henry Grosshans, 1983)</FONT> In a letter to a friend he wrote that the "nationalist terror will probably outlast me". </P>
<P>Barlach was forced to resign from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Also <A href="kollwitz.htm">K&auml;the Kollwitz</A>, who had been appointed to the Academy in 1919, resigned. At Magdeburg, Barlach's memorial was removed in response to the church council's demands and stored in the Berlin National Gallery. Many of Barlach's sculptures were removed from German museums, his books were not published, and in 1937 his works were included in the "Degenerate Art" exhibition. Among the other condemned artists were Otto Dix, George Grosz, <A href="kandinsk.htm">Wassily Kandinsky</A>, <A href="kokos.htm">Oskar Kokoschka</A>, and some Jewish painters, such as Marc Chagall. At the opening of the exhibition in Munich, Hitler called Expressionists as criminals and fools, and announced a purging policy "against the last elements of our cultural perversion." However, Barlach never experienced physical violence or was imprisoned. But he suspected that his mail was being opened, and to avoid Gestapo's attention, he gave letters to friends to deliver and burned papers which the authorities could use against him. </P>
<P>In 1938 Piper's book on Barlach,<I> Zeichnungen von Ernst Barlach</I>, was confiscated. Barlach was not an explicitly political artist, although he had contributed some lithographs to a socialist magazine during World War I. It was not until after World War II that his works were reinstated and his plays performed. </P>
<P>Barlach's novel or anti-novel about good and evil, <I>Der gestohlene Mond</I>, which he composed in the 1930s, was published in 1948. <I>Seespeck</I> (1948), which he wrote in the 1910s, was an account of a midlife crisis.<I> Ein Selbsterz&auml;hltes Leben</I> (1928) was Barlach's detailed autobiography from his childhood to his wandering years and early struggle as an artist. </P>
