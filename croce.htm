      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Italian critic,
philosopher,
politician, historian. Croce deeply influenced aesthetic thought in the
first half of the 20th century, including Robin C. Collingwood's<i>
Principles of Art </i>(1934) and John Dewey's <i>Art as Experience</i>
(1934), although in the latter the philosophical background is totally
different. Croce's main thesis was that art is intuition. His
best-known work in the English-speaking world is <i>Aesthetic as
Science of Expression and General Linguistic</i> (1902). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is deeply ironic that Croce,
defender of the autonomy of art, aesthetician, a man endowed with a
great sensibility, good taste, and judgment, was finally unable to
develop a theoretical and analytical scheme of criticism and had to be
content (like many other critics) with defining his own taste,
selecting his canon of classics, and persuading others that he was
right. He was successful only for a time." </b>(René Wellek in </font><i><font size="2">A History of Modern Criticism 1750-1950</font></i><font size="2">, vol. 8, 1992) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Benedetto Croce was born in Pescasseroli, in the Abruzzi
region, into a moderately wealthy land-owning family. His parents,
Pasquale and Luisa Sipari Croce, were both pious Catholics,
and&nbsp;had him educated at a Catholic boarding school. In 1883 Croce
lost his parents and his younger sister in an earthquake in
Casamicciola, on the island of Ischia &#8211; he was buried for several hours
and severely injured. Hearing his father crying was a traumatic
experience, from which&nbsp;he never quite recovered. </p>
      <p>Orphaned at the age of 17, Croce went to live in Rome with his
uncle,&nbsp;Silvio Spaventa,&nbsp;brother of the Hegelian philosopher
Bertrando Spaventa. After studying briefly at the University of Rome,
Croce left without taking a degree and returned in 1885 to Naples,
where he lived the life of a gentleman-scholar, writing about every
issue of contemporary concern. He never held a university position. </p>
      <p>During the next years Croce travelled in Spain, Germany,
France, and England. He became interested in history after reading the
literary historian Francesco De Sanctis. Under the influence of
Gianbattista Vico's (1668-1744) thoughts about art and history he
turned to philosophy in 1893. Croce also purchased the 18th century
house in which Vico had lived. His friend, the philosopher Giovanni
Gentile encouraged him to read Hegel. Croce's famous commentary on
Hegel, <i>What is Living and What is Dead in the Philosophy of Hegel</i>,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1907. </p>
      <p>Croce, Antonio Labriola (1843-1904), and Georges Sorel
(1847-1922) were known as the Holy Trinity of Latin Marxist studies,
but Croce rejected Marx's determinism. In art nothing can determine in
advance the direction our expression will take. In <i>Historical
Materialism and the Economics of Karl Marx</i> (1900) Croce stated that
"the capitalist society studied by Marx is not any society that ever
existed or does exist." Only Antonio Gramsci, an original&nbsp;Marxist
philosopher,&nbsp; could challenge Croce's position as the&nbsp;leading
thinker of Italy. Though Gramsci's disciplines never achieved political
power, &nbsp;in culture wars against Croce they got the upper hand. </p>
      <p>In 1896 Croce entered the cultural scene with his book about
the concept of history in its relationship to the concept of art. He
noticed that the philosophical foundations of aesthetics did not yet
exist. In the following works he attempted to demonstrate the
superiority of arts over the natural sciences, which&nbsp;he considered
as a system of "pseudo-concepts." </p>
      <p>From 1906 Croce worked as an adviser with his publisher,
Laterza and Sons, Bari, to produce three highly influential literature
series, 'Writers of Italy,' 'Classics of Philosophy,' and 'The Library
of Modern Culture.' In 1914 Croce married a high school Adele Rossi, a
high school teacher from Turin. They had four daughters and
one&nbsp;son who died. For many years, Croce spent summers with her and
his growing family in a resort town in the Piedmont mountains. In
Turin, he was respectfully addressed as "Don Benedetto." </p>
      <p>In honor of his achievements, Croce was appointed&nbsp;senator
for life by Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti in 1910. Later, in
1920-21, he&nbsp;served as&nbsp;Minister of Public Instruction in
Giolitti's final government,&nbsp;planning school reform. <em>La
Critica</em>, which&nbsp;Croce founded in 1903 with Giovanni Gentile,
became a forum for his thoughts.&nbsp;The magazine appeared until 1943,
but&nbsp;Gentile left it much before, in the 1920s. Fascism destroyed
their deep personal friendship. When&nbsp;Gentile&nbsp;started to
support fascism and signed the 'Manifesto of Fascist Intellectuals',
Croce published his 'Manifesto of Anti-Fascist Intellectuals' (1925). </p>
      <p>At first, Croce himself had regarded Fascism as a politically
promising movement, but in the theoretical realm, he criticized its
ideology and rejected Gentile's and his pupils attempts to identify
idealism with fascism. "For me fascism is the contrary of liberalism",
he said in a letter. Mussolini's own paper,<em> Il Popolo d'Italia</em>,
called Croce "a walking ghost" and "a corpse four days old." </p>
      <p>During the reign of Mussolini and World War II, Croce
supported democratic principles, although he was skeptical about
democracy: "Sound political sense has never regarded the masses as the
directing focus of society..." He never joined any underground
movement, but his historical essays, in which he defended the liberal
ideals of the Risorgimento, made him a high-profile opponent of the
regiment. </p>
      <p>Known&nbsp;as one of the major anti-fascist thinkers in Italy,
Croce driven more and more into isolation from the society. After he
refused to take the loyalty oath, he was no longer invited to the
meetings of the Reale Accademia of Naples. In a letter to the president
of Stockholm University in 1938 he expressed his horror at the
persecution of Jews. The letter was published in Sweden and after it
became known in Italy it brought threats against the author. Visitors
at his home were listed in police reports and his houses were under
surveillance. As a senator, Croce could not be arrested without the
consent of the Senate, but fascist partisans planned in 1944 to kidnap
him in the Villa Tritone in Sorrento, where he lived after leaving
Naples to escape the bombings. </p>
      <p>After the war Croce was appointed Minister without Portofilio
of the new democratic government and member of the Constituent
Assembly. When the Italian people were called upon to choose between
monarchy and republic in a referendum, Croce himself&nbsp;supported
the&nbsp;monarchy.&nbsp;Though he was open to social reforms, he viewed
Communism with suspicion and stated that "liberalism and democracy are
like two Siamese brothers, two persons joined by one circulatory blood
system."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Until his resingment from politics in&nbsp;1947&nbsp;Croce
served as President of the reconstituted Liberal Party. On his
retirement Croce established the Institute for Historical Studies in
his Naples home, which held a magnificent collection of books. Croce
continued his intellectual work until the last days of his
life.&nbsp;When he was asked about his health, he said, "I am dying at
my work." Croce died in Naples on November 20, 1952. He had been
suffering from a kidney infection after an attack of influenca. The
family refused a state funeral. No official speeches were made on the
day of the funeral, which the government&nbsp;had proclaimed a day of
mourning. </p>
      <p>Croce maintained that there is no physical reality, nothing
exists except the activity of spirit in history. Like Hegel, he
identified philosophy with the history of philosophy. History moves on
with no final stage: it is the only reality, and the only conceptual
and genuine form of knowledge. The physical is solely a construction of
mind. Croce distinguished two basic aspects of experience &#8211; the
theoretical, which included among others intuition, and the practical.
In this category he placed all economic, political and utilitarian
activities. The categories are dialectical, there is no action without
thought. In normal experience intuition and concept combine, but in
aesthetic experience we hold the two apart. In a work of art, form and
content are inseparable. Intuition is free from concepts, it "is blind:
the intellect lends its eyes to it." Criticism cannot be founded on
rules or theories. "It is said that there are certain truths of which
definitions cannot be given; that cannot be demonstrated by syllogistic
reasoning; that must be grasped intuitively... The critic holds himself
honour bound to set aside, when confronted by a work of art, all
theories and abstractions and to judge it by intuiting it directly."<font size="2"> (from T</font><i><font size="2">he Aesthetic as the Science
of Expression and of the Linguistic in General</font></i><font size="2">,
translated by Colin Lyas). </font></p>
      <p>As a critic he started from the popular assumption that
analysis of texts themselves must precede other analysis. Works of art
must be viewed in the light of their own, entire context. The<i>
intentional world</i> of the poet is one thing and, and <i>poetry</i>
is another &#8211; "what matters is not what the poet proposes or believes to
make, but only what he has actually made." Croce distinguished
expression from representation. Representational works of art tell a
story, and if our interest is merely in the story, then the work has
for us instrumental value. But when we are interested in expression, we
are interested in the unique experience expressed by this special work
of art. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The artist is always morally
blameless and philosophically irreproachable, even though his art may
have for subject matter a low morality and philosophy: insofar he is an
artist, he does not act and does not reason, but composes poetry,
paints, sings, and in short, expresses himself."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Nuovi saggi di estetica</font></i><font size="2">, 3th ed.,
1948) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Croce believed in intuition as the main source of artistic
creation.&nbsp;Works of art are examples of intuitive knowledge, which
exists before it is apprehended by an individual artist. Basically
artistic intuition do not differ in method from ordinary intuition, the
difference is empirical (quantitative). Thus M. Jourdain in Molière's
comedy <em>Le Bourgeois gentilhomme</em> was right in his discovery
that he&nbsp;had been speaking prose all&nbsp;his life, "and didn't
even know it!" A poet realizes his intuition verbally, through the
process of writing. According to Croce, poetry is emotion, an
expression of the soul at the moment of intuition. The task of an art
critic is to characterize the image of the work, an unified mental
picture of a particular thing, define its emotional aspects and
evaluate how faithful the image is to emotion. Image consists of
smaller parts, plot, setting, language. </p>
      <p>Croce's conservative, classical taste led him to&nbsp;reject
French symbolist poetry and experimental movements. He also dismissed
translation as a logically imposible task, which&nbsp;somewhat
hindered&nbsp;the development of translation studies in Italy. Croce
disliked <a href="pirandel.htm">Pirandello</a>, Rimbaud's 'Bal des
pendus' showed him "stupid inhumanity," he ridiculed Valéry for his
poetic theory, and criticized <a href="dannun.htm">D'Annunzio</a> for
not having inner clarity. Thoroughly disappointed with contemporary
literature, he eventually gave up writing. </p>
