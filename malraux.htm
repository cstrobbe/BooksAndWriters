and statesman, minister for cultural affairs for 11 years in 1958-1969.
Malraux was a man of action in the service of noble causes as was the
British soldier-writer <a href="telawren.htm">T.E. Lawrence</a>. He
fought in the Spanish Civil war and joined the French Resistance forces
in World War II. Malraux's best-known work is <span style="font-style: italic;">La Condition humaine</span> (1933, Man's
Fate), a story of revolution, psychological anguish, and death. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Malraux's career begins in mystery
with
the expedition to Indo-China, the obscure affair of the missing
statues, a short term of imprisonment, and a plunge into Eastern
politics. The details of these matters are still unknown to us, but it
is their resonance that counts. With all their shadow and uncertainty
they nevertheless suggest a purity of adventure. Malraux entered the
European consciousness not as a writer but as an event, as a symbolic
figure somehow combining the magical qualities of youth and heroism
with a sense of unlimited promise." </b>(William Righter in</font><i><font size="2"> The Rhetorical Hero</font></i><font size="2">, 1964) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Georges-André Malraux was born in Paris into a wealthy family.
His
father, Fernand-Georges Malraux, a stockbroker, and mother Berthe
(Lamy) Malraux, separated when he was a child. Fernand-Georges then
lived with Lilette Godard, whom he married in 1922, but he also courted
and seduced Lilette's sister, Gaby. He committed suicide in 1930.</p>
      <p>From his childhood, Malraux suffered from Tourette's syndrome,
which
showed in a nervous facial tic and muscular and vocal activity. His
early hyperactivity became later an extension of his public
personality, in his energetic gesticulation and way of speech. </p>
      <p>Malraux was brought up by his mother and grandmother,
Adrienne, who
managed a small grocery store in Bondy, outside Paris. For the Easter
and summer holidays, Malraux father took his son to Dunkirk, where his
grandfather Alphonse lived. </p>
      <p>After attending the Lycée Condorcet, Malraux studied oriental
languages at the École des Langues Orientales, but left his studies
without graduating. After working briefly for bookdealers and
publishers, he went to Cambodia at the age of 21 with his wife, the
writer Clara Goldsmidt. They hoped to rediscover the Khmer temples, but
Malraux was arrested for taking bas-reliefs from a temple at Bantai
Srey. After his three years' sentence was voided, Malraux edited an
anti-colonialist newspaper in Saigon and returned briefly to France. In
1925 he went to Saigon to join the anti-colonial Young Annam League. </p>
      <p>According to some sources, Malraux worked in the 1920s for
Guomindang in China, where he witnessed the 1927 revolution. However,
this information has been open to doubt. Malraux first important book, <span style="font-style: italic;">La Tentation de l'Occident</span>
(1926), explored the parallels between Eastern and Western culture. The
work was set on the early stages of the Chinese revolution and focused
on the exchange of letters between a young European and a young Asian
intellectual. Its was followed by an adventure story, <span style="font-style: italic;">La Voie royale</span>
(1930), set in the Indochinese jungle. The book was largely a dialogue
on death; it was one Malraux's main themes. "The mystery of life
appears to each one of us as it appears to almost every woman when she
looks into a child's face and to almost every man when he looks into
the face of someone dead", Malraux once said.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Les Conquérants</span> (1928) dealt with
a revolutionary strike and its European organizers in Canton. Malraux
continued on revolutionary themes in <i>La Condition humaine</i> and <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Espoir</span>
(1937). Although he was aware of Stalin's crimes, he praised the Soviet
system. For a short time, he was interested in the figure of Trotsky,
who later said that "Malraux is organically incapable of moral
independence". </p>
      <p>During this period Malraux worked as an art editor at
Gallimard
publishers in Paris, and went on archaeological expeditions in Iran and
Afghanistan. His exploration by airplane of the Arabian hinterland led
to the discovery of the lost city that supposedly had been the seat of
the Queen of Sheba. In 1933 appeared one of Malraux's most famous
novels, <i>La Condition humaine </i>(Man's Fate). It won the Goncourt
Prize and established his international reputation. Gisèle Freund, who
met Malraux just after the publication of the book, took one of the
most famous photos of the author, his hair blown with wind, and a
cigarette butt stuck to his lips. "There was drama in his simplest
words," Freund recalled. </p>
      <p><i>Man's Fate</i> depicted a Communist uprising in Shanghai
and the
party's later annihilation in a massacre led by its former ally Chiang
Kai-shek and his Nationalist forces. Again Malraux's alienated
revolutionary heroes, men of action caught up in history &#8211; Ch'en, a
young Chinse fighter, Kyo Gisors, a Eurasian organizer, Katow, a former
student of medicine from Russia, and others &#8211; find a sense of human
solidarity and dignity in death. "The great mystery is not that we
should have been thrown here at random between the profusion of matter
and that of the stars; it is that from our very prison we should draw,
from our own selves, images powerful enough to deny our nothingness." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Man's Fate</font></i><font size="2">)</font>
Ch'en is a terrorist who struggles with his orders: "He was serving the
gods of his choice; but beneath his sacrifice to the Revolution lay a
world of depths beside which this night of crushing anguish was bright
as day. 'To assassinate is not only to kill, alas...'" The title of the
book came from the 17th-century philosopher Pascal. At the end of the
novel, Katow gives away his cyanide capsules, and faces his death,
complete aware of its nature - he will be thrown into the boiler of a
steam locomotive. </p>
      <p>With Louis Aragon, Malraux founded the International
Association of Writers for the Defence of Culture. His short novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Temps du mépris</span>
(1935), was a Book of the Month Club selection in the United States. It
told the story of a Communist, who is held prisoner in a Nazi
concentration camp. He is released when an unknown fellow Communist
surrenders in his place.</p>
      <p>Malraux backed many antifascist and leftist causes in the
1930s. He
fought for the Republicans (1936-39) in the Spanish Civil War, and
organized the Air Force of the International Brigades. His own role in
the war Malraux later exaggerated, but he was wounded twice in the
effort to halt Franco's advance on Madrid. Malraux and his pilots were
paid well for their services. </p>
      <p>Malraux's novel <i>L'Espoir</i> paints a wide picture of
Republican
Spain in combat. The author follows the fortunes of the International
Brigade from front to front, giving simultaneous impressions from
different places as if he had been an eyewitness. However, he couldn't
be at the same time in Madrid and Barcelona. The book was published
while the war was still going on. It ends at the battle of Guadalajara
in March 1937. A month after the battle German planes bombed the small
town of Guernica. This destruction became the subject of Picasso's
famous painting of the same name. Malraux was one of the few persons,
who were allowed to be present while Picasso worked with the huge
canvas, twenty-five feet by eleven feet. <i>L'Espoir</i> was adapted
for the screen in 1938, but the film, <i>Sierrade Teruel</i>, was not
shown in France until after World War II. </p>
      <p><i>L'Espoir</i> ended one period in Malraux's life. He
divorced and
had a liaison with the writer Josette Clotis, who died in 1945 in a
railroad accident. Malraux broke with communism &#8211; he did not accept the
Nazi-Soviet pact &#8211; and concentrated on writing non-fiction. After the
war he was openly against Stalinism. </p>
      <p>In World War II he served in a French tank Unit. After being
wounded
and captured during the breakthrough of 1940, he escaped from the
prison camp at Seans. In 1942 he tried to divorce his wife, who refused
&#8211; she was Jewish and needed even a token marriage with an Aryan
husband. Malraux managed to escape his German captors a second time in
1944. After the Normandy invasion, he became an active member of the
Resistance and eventually headed the Brigade Alsace-Lorraine in its
defence of Strasbourg and entry into Stuttgart in 1945. His service was
recognized by the award of the Médaille de la Résistance, the Croix de
Guerre, and the British Distinguished Service Order. </p>
      <p>Malraux became the foremost spokesman of Gaullist politics. He
served briefly as minister of information in de Gaulle's provisional
government of 1945-46. In the late 1940s and 1950s Malraux wrote
several books on art and aesthetics. These include <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Voix du silence</span> (1951), a
well-documented synthesis of the history of art in all countries and
all ages, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Le musée imaginaire de
la sculpture mondiale</span>
(1952-54). Malraux stated that all art is a revolt against man's fate,
and art is a means of transcendence. "Art," he once said, "is an
anti-destiny." The distinguished critic Edmund Wilson compared <i>The
Psychology of Art</i> with the <i>chefs d'&#339;uvre</i> of Gibbon, Marx,
and Tolstoy, which led the art historian <a href="gombric.htm">E.H.
Gombrich</a> to point out that "Malraux's text, against such a
background, looks like a mere string of accumulated <i>aperçus</i>,
sometimes brilliant, sometimes vacuous, but nowhere imbued with that
sense of responsibility that makes the scholar or the artist. There is
no evidence that Malraux had done a day's consecutive reading in a
library or that he has even tried to hunt up a few facts." <font size="2">(from 'André Malraux and the Crisis of Expressionism,' in </font><i><font size="2">Meditations on a Hobby Horse</font></i><font size="2">, 1963)
      </font></p>
      <p>In 1948 Malraux married Marie-Madeleine Lioux, a concert
pianist and
widow of his half-brother. In 1961 he lost his two sons in an accident.
When de Gaulle came to power in 1958, he appointed Malraux as his first
Minister of Information. A year later he was appointed Minister of
State for Cultural Affairs. He held this post for ten years. </p>
      <p>Malraux authorized the cleaning of the Louvre and other grand
facades, which was considered by many critics an act of vandalism. In
1962 Malraux visited the United States, where he met among others
Jacqueline Kennedy, and promised that <i>Mona Lisa</i> will be shown
in America. Without complicated bureaucratic maneuvers, Leonardo's
painting was sent overseas on the luxury liner <i>France</i>. Almost
two million Americans saw the famous work. During this period also a
retrospective exhibition was arranged to honor Picasso. Picasso had
first resisted the idea, and Malraux himself did not want to approach
the painter. "You're mad," was Malraux's answer when he was urged to
visit Picasso. "He would leave me standing at the gate, sending word
that someone was coming to open. And I'd wait there for hours while
they tipped off <i>L'Humanité</i>." The exhibition was a great
success, and in <i>Picasso's Mask</i> (1974) Malraux referred to it as
the "retrospective show I had organized". </p>
      <p>After de Gaulle withdrew from public life, Malraux started to
write his <span style="font-style: italic;">Antimémoires</span>,
in which he used excerpts from his novels, mixing fact and fiction and
defying the conventional view of an autobiography. The first part came
out in 1967. In <i>The Fallen Oaks</i> (1971) the author reported his
conversations with de Gaulle, his political idol. After leaving his
place at the centre of politics, Malraux retired to a suburb of Paris,
where he continued to write until his death. He was also an active
letter writer, and often decorated his letters with the image of a cat.
      </p>
      <p>Malraux died in Paris on November 23, 1976. An international
Malraux
Society was founded in the United States in 1968. It published
bio-bibliographical material in its <i>Mélanges Malraux/Malraux
Miscellany</i> between 1969 and 1986, when it was superseded by the <i>Revue
André Malraux.</i> In 1976 started the publication of Malraux's works
in the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade series. </p>
