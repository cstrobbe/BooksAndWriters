      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Polish novelist, short-story
writer, and
political dissident, whose most famous work is <i>Popiol i diament</i>
(1948, Ashes and Diamonds). It dealt with the conflict between two
visions of the world in Poland, some years before "a people's republic"
was established in 1947. Andrzejewski's novel was translated into more
than 20 languages and adapted for screen in 1958 by the director
Andrzej Wajda. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What lay ahead, what sort of life,
what future? The worst years had passed but now, at the beginning of a
new day, it looked as if so much had been destroyed, so much laid
waste, so much crushed down and afflicted, that the destructive force,
as though yet unappeased, was encroaching upon the present, poisoning
even the future, in which she placed her hopes during the worst
periods." </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Ashes and Diamonds</font></i><font size="2">, tr. David J. Welsh) </font> </blockquote>
      <p>Jerzy Andrzejewski was born in Warsaw into a middle-class
family. His father was a grocer and mother the daughter of a provincial
doctor. Andrzejevski studied Polish literature at the University of
Warsaw, without taking a degree, and contributed to the literary weekly
      <i>Prosto z mostu</i>. He had started to write in his early
boyhood. Andrzjewski's first works <i>Drogi nieuniknione</i> (1936), a
volume of short stories, and <i>Lad secra</i> (1938), published in <i>Prosto
z mostu</i>, showed the influence of such French Catholic writers as <a href="mauriac.htm">François Mauriac</a> and <a href="bernanos.htm">Georges
Bernanos</a>. <i>Lad secra</i> received the award of the Polish
Academy of Literature. Andzejewski was called the most gifted Catholic
writer of his country, a "Polish Mauriac." </p>
      <p>During WW II Andrzejewski was a member of the Resistance
movement in Warsaw. <i>Noc </i>(1945),
Andrzejewski's collection of short stories, dealt with the war and
occupation. This collection contained the novella 'Wielki tydzien'
(Holy Week), written in the spring of 1943 and adapted for the screen
by Andrzej Wajda some fifty decades later. Structured around the plight
of a Jewish woman, Irena Lilien, it dealt with emotional and moral
responses towards the Jews and saving her as the Warsaw Ghetto burns.
Lilien understands that she is doomed, but she also prophesies that the
Poles will soon be killing each other for ideological reasons. In
occupied Poland helping Jews was punished by death. In addition, the
predominat attitude towards Jews was hostile; for a long period they
had been the main targets of nationalists. Andrzejewski himself helped
Jews in hiding at the risk of his own life. Later, during the communist
period, the 1968 purge drove more than half the Jews then living in
Poland out of the country. After decades silence, in the 1980s, writers
began to examine Polish-Jewish relations. </p>
      <p>With <i>Popiól i diament</i> (Ashes and Diamonds)
Andrzejewski captured the agony of the war-torn generation. Its title
and motto, how a new society can be created, was taken from Cyprian
Norwid's (1821-1883) drama <i>Za kulisami. </i>The novel covers three
days in May 1945 in the district city of Ostrowiec, where old ideals
collide with the rise of a new government. Wajda's celebrated film
version from 1958 completed the director's informal trio begun with <i>A
Generation</i> (Pokolonie, 1955) and <i>Sewer / They Loved Life</i>
(Kanal, 1957). One of the characters says: "But nowadays I've
met so many people who broke down and failed this or that test that I
don't attach much importance to what a man thinks of himself. Until a
man faces the test he can deceive himself endlessly." </p>
      <p>The protagonist is a young Polish nationalist and partisan,
Maciek Chelmicki, a member of the underground Home Army. His acts of
terrorism bring him in conflict with the new social order. Maciek is
assigned to assassinate a new Communist district secretary, Szczuka,
who has returned from Russia. Maciek and Szczuka, both sympathetically
portrayed, form a contrasting pair &#8211; the young man representing the
past and cynicism, the old man the future and purposefulness. As Maciek
waits in a hotel, he meets a young woman, Krystyna. She works at the
bar, where people celebrate the end of the war and drown bad memories
in liquor. Maciek and Krystyna both like violets, and they spend some
time together. Maciek shoots Szczuka in the street, but in the morning
he is in turn fatally wounded by soldiers. Maciek dies on a giant
scrap-heap &#8211; an obvious symbol. Highly dramatic, realistic in detail,
and full of memorable scenes, such as Maciek setting fire to liquor in
glasses, and Maciek and Krystyna conversing in a ruined church
building, where a figure of Christ hangs upside down. </p>
      <p>After the war Andrzejewski joined the Writers' Union. The
fairly liberal cultural atmosphere did not last long. Early in 1949 the
Union of Polish Writers adopted the Soviet model for socialist realism.
In 1949 Andrzejewski was elected president of the Polish Writers'
Union. He produced some books in the Socialist Realist vein, and
defended in his journalism the Communist rule in Poland. Andrzejewski
(as Alfa) was portrayed by <a href="milosz.htm">Czeslaw Milosz</a> in <i>Captive
Mind</i> (1953), which revealed the problems of intellectuals living
under Stalinism. Milosz described his colleague under the code name
quot;Alfa" as a man with a "barometer-like sensitivity to the moral
opinion of his environment".</p>
      <p>Andrzejewski's companion from 1941 to 1943 was Wanda
Wertenstein, who gained prominence as a film critic and screenwriter;
she was partly the model for Irena Lilien in <i>Holy Week</i>. Another
model was Janina Askenazy, the daughter of Simon Askenazy (1866-1935),
a historian. In 1945 Andrzejewski married his second wife, Maria
Abgarowicz. His first wife he had left soon after their wedding in
1934. From 1952 to 1954 Andrzejewski was editor of a leading cultural
weekly, <i>Przeglad kulturalny</i>, and from 1952 to 1957 he was a
member of the Polish parliament. In protest against censorship he
resigned from the party in 1957. Andrzejewski then moved towards more
or less open criticism of the government, starting from the novel <i>The
Inquisitors</i> (tr. 1960), a philosophical parable on the autocratic
rule of a totalitarian ideology. Primarily following the thoughts of a
young Dominican, it documents how his personality is changing as he
adopts the mind of his teacher, Torquemada. </p>
      <p>Andrzejewski's characters are often defeated by circumstances,
or forces outside of the control of themselves. <i>The Appeal </i>(1968)
attacked directly the Communist regime and was not published in Poland.
The protagonist is Marian Konieczy, a middle-aged paranoiac and
faithful supporter of the United Workers Party. He is too conscientious
and uncorrupted in his work and is shut up in an institution, where he
appeals to the First Secretary, whom he trusts. Andrzejewski seems to
say that sometimes paranoiacs are actually persecuted, but only an
insane person can truly believe in the totalitarian system. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I consider myself a very Polish
product in many ways, i.e. a- and simplifying it a little &#8211; a person
generally more immune to great hardships than to the petty troubles of
everyday life. Two periods in my life I consider the most intense: the
second World War and the period preceding the so-called 'Polish
October.' I lived through two great spiritual adventures: in my youth,
the Roman Catholic Church; and in my middle age the experience of
Marxism."</b> (Jerzy Andrzejewski in </font><i><font size="2">World
Authors 1950-1970</font></i><font size="2">, ed. John Wakeman, 1975) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In general, Andrzejewski's career reflected the typical
development of an eastern European intellectual after World War II,
from the initial support of the Communist policies to the later more or
less openly expressed disappointment. The widening gulf between reality
and official truths led Andrzjeweski to such explorations of mass
movements and culture as <i>Bramy raju</i> (1960, The Gates of
Paradise), focusing on the Children's Crusade of 1212, and the
satirical <i>Idzie skaczac po górach</i> (1963, A Sitter for a Satyr),
in which Andrzejewski used a stream-of-consciousness style. The
Picasso-like protagonist is Antonio Ortiz, a celebrated artist and
genius, who is surrounded by women, art dealers, and sycophants. He
thinks he has lost his creativity, but returns to painting after the
stimulation of young love and energy. Andrzejewski's ambiguous thoughts
and experimental use of language was a problem for the authorities, and
several of his works were left unpublished. His most important novel
from late 1960s, <i>Miazga</i> (1969), a portrait of modern Polish
intelligentsia, did not appear officially until 1981. </p>
      <p>Andrzejewski, Kazimierz Brandys, Tadeuz Konwicki, Wlodzimierz
Odojewski, and several other authors printed their works in the late
1970s and early 1980s in the literary quarterly <i>Zapis</i>
(1979-82), or in the emigré publishers. In 1979 Andrzejewski helped
found the workers' defence committee (KOR) to aid families of striking
workers, who were jailed or dismissed from their jobs. Andrzejewski
died on April 19/20, 1983, in Warsaw. His novel on the homosexual Roman
emperor Heliogabalus was left unfinished. </p>
