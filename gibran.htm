<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Lebanese-American philosophical
essayist, novelist, mystical poet, and artist. In the 1960s Gibran's
works influenced especially American popular culture; his most famous
book,<em> The Prophet </em>(1923), has been a bestseller from the
1920s. Critics have not treated the book well. Gibran believed that if
a sensible way of living and thinking could be found, people would have
mastery over their lives. </p>
      <blockquote>
        
        <p><font size="2"><strong><font size="2">When love beckons to
you, follow him, </font><br>
Though his ways are hard and steep.</strong></font><font size="2"><strong><br>
And when his wings enfold you yield to him,<br>
        <font size="2">Though the sword hidden among his pinions may
wound<br>
you</font></strong></font><font size="2"><strong><font size="2">. <br>
And when he speaks to you believe in him, <br>
Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north <br>
wind lays waste the garden.</font><br>
        </strong><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The
Prophet</font></i><font size="2">)</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Khalil Gibran was born in Bechari (Besharri), Lebanon, an
isolated&nbsp;mountain village of Maronite Christians. At that time
Lebanon was an autonomous province of Turkey. Gibran once said that the
date of&nbsp;his birth is unknown,&nbsp;but it has been&nbsp;deduced
that he was born on January 6, 1883. Gibran's mother Kamila <span class="st"><span class="ft">had been married previously to her cousin
Hanna Abd-al-Salaam Rahme. They had one son before he abandoned her and
went to Brazil, where he died. </span></span></p>
      <p>A talented child,&nbsp;Gibran was modelling, drawing, and
writing at an early age. "My father had a very imperious temper and was
not a loving person," Gibran recalled his childhood. Khalil,&nbsp;his
father,&nbsp;owned a walnut grove, but much of its earnings&nbsp;he
spent in gambling. In 1895 Kamila took her children to the United
States; their father remained in Lebanon. The family settled first in
Boston, where she earned living by selling laces and linen. Within a
year she managed to save enough money to help her son Peter to open a
small dry goods store. </p>
      <p>Gibran went to Lebanon in 1897 for two years to study in
Beirut at the Maronite college Madsasat-al-Hikma College. Under the
guidance of Father Youssef Haddad, he read the Arab classics,
translations from the French, and Syrian novelists and poets. In his
final year at the college, Gibran edited the student magazine <span style="font-style: italic;">The Beacon</span> (Al-Manarah). Within a
year after his return to Boston, Gibran lost three members of his
family: his sister, his mother who died of cancer, and half brother. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Gibran's artistic talents was recognized by his art teacher
and he was introduced to Fred Holland Day, a photographer and follower
of of the European avant-garde movement, who tutored him in art and
literature. Gibran's sister Marianna supported him while he established
himself as a writer and painter.</p>
      <p>Through Day, Gibran was given entrée to Boston society, where
he acquired valuable contacts. He had an affair with Josephine Peabody,
a poet and&nbsp;dramatist who organized his drawing exhibition.
Josephine&nbsp;was nine years his senior. After she married&nbsp;they
still kept up correspondence.&nbsp;Though Gibran usually preferred
women older than himself, Gertrude Barrie, a pianist and
feminist,&nbsp;was close to him in age. The liaison began in 1906,
before he left for Paris. </p>
      <p>Gibran's most ardent benefactress was Mary Haskell, the
headmistress of a progressive girl's school in Cambridge. Her father
was a vice-president of a Columbia bank. Born in 1873, Mary was ten
years Gibran's senior, a strongly built woman of five feet six. She had
light brown hair and blue eyes, "a tall and cadaverous maiden, / With
head that was large and ungainly, / With eyes far apart like the
owlets'," as she candidly wrote in her autobiographical poems. Mary
supported her protégé financially for most of his career and edited
Gibran's English-language books. </p>
      <p>In 1904 Gibran had his first art exhibition in Boston&nbsp;at
Day's studio. The drawings were mostly spiritual allegories. "The
earnest desire to give expression to metaphysical ideas has
triumphantly prevailed over technical limitations to the extent that
the imagination is greatly stirred by the abstract&nbsp;or moral beauty
of the thought," said a rewiever in the <em>Evening Transcript</em>.
Gibran's first book,<em> Al-Musiqa</em> (1905) was about music. It was
followed by two collections of short stories and a novelette in 1912.
From 1908 to 1910 he studied art in Paris with August Rodin. In 1912 he
settled in New York, where he felt himself more comfortable than in the
social circles of the Boston elite. In addition to contributing to
émigré magazines such as<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Arts</span>
(Al-Funun) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Traveler</span>
(As-Sa'ih), he devoted himself painting. Though concerned with the
transcendental in his books, the basic subject in Gibran's art was
naked human bodies, tenderly intertwined.</p>
      <p>Gibran's first works were written in Arabic and are considered
central to the development of modern Arabic literature. His
early&nbsp;influences&nbsp;were drawn&nbsp;from Sufism to Hinduism, the
English romantic poets to the Boston decadents and the symbolism of
Maeterlink and W.B. Yeats. Gibran also wrote for journals published by
the Lebanese and Arab communities in the U.S. Conservative
Arabic-speaking readers were offended by his negative portrayal of the
clergy and feudal lords. From 1918 he wrote mostly in English and
managed to revolutionize the language of poetry in the 1920s and 1930s.
His first book for the publishing company Alfred Knopf was&nbsp;<em>The
Madman </em>&nbsp;(1918), a slim volume of aphorisms and parables
written in biblical cadence somewhere between poetry and prose. <em>Sand
and Foam</em> (1926) was greeted with lukewarm reviews, but <em>Jesus,
the Son of Man</em> (1928) received general acclaim. "Here is a
treatment, certainly unusual, possibly unique," said P. W. Wilson in
the <em>Times</em>. Gibran's other popular books include <em>The
Earth Gods </em>(1931), a dialogue in free verse between three titans
on the human destiny.</p>
      <p>Usually Gibran used prophetic tone to condemn the evils that
torment his homeland or threaten the humankind. His style, a
combination of beauty and spirituality, became known as 'Gibranism.' "I
am a stranger to myself. I hear my tongue speak, but my ears find that
voice strange. I may see my hidden self laughing, crying, defiant
frightened, and thus does my being become enamored of my being and thus
my soul begs my soul for explanation. But I remain unknown, hidden,
shrouded in fog, veiled in silence."<font size="2"><b> </b>(from
'The Poet')</font> In 1920 he founded a society for Arab writers called
"Aribitah" (the pen bond), and supported the struggle to revolutionize
the classically conservative Arabic literature. A very important
channel for new ideas was <i>Al Magar</i>, the first New York Arabic
newspaper, that Gibran wrote for. Other influential&nbsp;contributors
included Mikha'il Nu'aima (1889-1988), Iliya Abu Madi (1889-1957),
Nasib Arida (1887-1946), Nadra Haddad (1881-1950), and Ilyas Abu Sabaka
(1903-47). Especially Mikha'il Nu'aima's critical writings paved way to
new freedom in poetic expression. </p>
      <p>Although Gibran was not a great poet in verse, and most of his
writings in prose should not be regarded as "poetry," he opened doors
to a new kind of creativity. He also illustrated a number of his books
with his own drawings. Salma Khadra Jayyusi wrote in 1987 that Gibran's
rhythm "fell on ears like magic, intoxicating in its frequent use of
interrogations, repetitions, and the vocative; by a language which was
at once modern, elegant, and original; and by an imagery that was
evocative and imbued with a healthy measure of emotion. His vision of a
world made sterile by dead mores and conventions but redeemable through
love, good will, and constructive action deepened his readers' insights
en enlightened their views of life and man." </p>
      <p>Heavy drinking contributed to Gibran's health problems. "New
York is a wasteland," he wrote to his sister. "There is not a drop of
arak to drink before dinner and no song by Maroon after dinner. . . ."
Gibran died of liver disease, possibly accelerated by alcoholism, in
St. Vincent's Hospital,&nbsp;New York, on April 10, 1931. According to
a nun's testimony, he refused the services of a priest. His funeral was
held&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Maronite Catholic Church in Boston. Gibran's body
was shipped back to his hometown in Lebanon, where alongside his tomb
The Gibran Museum was later established. In his will Gibran left all
the royalties of his books to his native village.&nbsp;During 1989,
when&nbsp; bombs were falling in Beirut, several of Gibran's drawings
and paintings were exhibited in London and Paris. </p>
      <p>Gibran's best-known work is <em>The Prophet</em>, a partly
autobiographical book of 26 poetic essays, which has been translated
into over 20 languages. The Prophet, who has lived in a foreign city 12
years, is about to board a ship that will take him home. He is stopped
by a group of people, whom he teaches the mysteries of life. The
resulting 26 sermons are meant to emancipate the listeners. In the
1960s <i>The Prophet</i> became a counterculture guide and in the
1980s the message of spiritualism overcoming material success was
adopted by Yuppies. Even today&nbsp;its mystical poetry is frequently
read at weddings.</p>
