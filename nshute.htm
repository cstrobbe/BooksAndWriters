<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British-born Australian novelist, an accomplished storyteller, whose best-known work, <span style="font-style: italic;">On the Beach</span> (1957), was adapted for the screen in 1959. The picture became one of the most celebrated anti-Bomb films, 
and attracted much attention all over the world, Moscow included because it was the first full-length American 
feature to have a premiere in the 
Soviet Union. Educated as an aeronautical engineer, Nevil Shute utilized  his expertise on technical issues and 
knowledge of aviation in his fiction. Shute's novels <span style="font-style: italic;">Pied Piper</span> (1942) and<span style="font-style: italic;"> A Town Like Alice</span> (1950) have also been 
made into major films. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A beautiful aircraft is the expression
of the genius of a great engineer who is also a great artist. It is
impossible for that man to carry out the whole of the design himself;
he works through a design office staffed by a hundred draughtsmen or
more. A hundred minds, each with their own less competent ideas, are
striving to modify the chief designer's original conception. If the
design is to appear in the end as a great artistic unity, the chief
designer must be a man of immensely powerful will, capable of imposing
his idea and his way of doing things on each of his hundred
draughtsmen, so that each one of them is too terrified to insert any of
his own ideas."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">No Highway</font></i><font size="2">, 1948) </font></blockquote>
<p>Nevil Shute Norway was born in Ealing, Middlesex, the son of Arthur Hamilton Norway, C.B., 
an assistant secretary of the General Post Office in London, and  the former Mary Louisa Gadsden. 
From an early age, Shute began to stammer badly, and as he later recalled, "a stammer certainly 
makes things tough for a little boy at school". In 1912 the family moved to Dublin, 
when Shute's father became head of the post office in Ireland. 
After witnessing the Easter Rising in Dublin, where he was a volunteer stretcher-bearer, 
Shute entered Balliol College, Oxford. He spent the later stages of World War I in military 
service and then continued his studies in Oxford, graduating in 1922.</p>
<p>In 1922 Shute joined the de Havilland Aircraft Company. Specializing
in Zeppelins, he was employed as an aeronautical engineer at Hawden
Airship Station. Shute worked as Chief Calculator and then Deputy Chief
Engineer of the Rigid Airship R100 project, one of the last of the
British airships. However, its gas valves, filled with hydrogn, were
built by the Zeppelin company. Shute flew aboard R100 in July 1930, on
its transatlantic crossing to Canada and back. The project ended after
the R101 disaster &#8211; the overweight and underpowerd airship of the
rivaling team crashed in France in October 1930, on the maide flight to
India. Next year, despite the recession, Shute founded with Hessell
Tiltman Airspeed Ltd., an aircraft construction company. In 1931, he
married Frances Mary Heaton, a doctor, with whom he had two daughters.</p>
<p>As a novelist Shute made his debut in 1926 with <span style="font-style: italic;">Marazan</span>, an adventure story of flying, embezzlement, and murder.   
It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">So Disdained</span> (1928), about loyalty, treason, and patriotism, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lonely Road</span> (1929), a spy thriller, 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ruined City</span> (1938), set in a shipbuilding  town in the grips of the Great Depression. Shute's heroes in these and 
his other works are decent, resourceful, and courageous, like  <a href="buchan.htm">John Buchan</a>'s Hannay and Sandy 
Arbuthnot, and they don't not have as hard-boiled mentality as typical American thriller heroes. </p>
<p>During the 1930s, Shute's company had grown successfully, employing
about a thousand people, and he decided to resign and devote himself
entirely to writing. However, he always insisted that he wrote just for
fun, and as he later said, "most of my adult life, perhaps all the
worthwhile part of it, has been spent in messing about aeroplanes." </p>
<p>The novel <i>Pied Piper</i> became a huge success and also was
adapted for the screen, for the first time in 1942. In the story an
elderly man, John Sidney Howard, helps a swarm of children to escape
the Nazis from France to the United States. In the beginning John
reluctantly promises an English couple to take their two children with
him back to England. During his journey through France the group grows,
and John submits to his role as the "Pied Piper". "He sat down again,
and began to fashion a whistle with the pen-knife that he kept for
scraping out his pipe... The Cavanagh children stood by him watching
his slow, wrinkled fingers as they worked; in their faces incredulity
melted into interest. He stripped the bark from the twig, cut deftly
with the little knife, and bound the bark into place. He put it to his
lips, and it gave out a shrill note." The book had two sequels,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Pastoral </span>(1944) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Most Secret </span>(1945). </p>
<p>During WW II Shute served as a lieutenant-commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and contributed 
to the development of a number of top-secret, specialized weapons. Originally he had joined the Volunteer 
Reserve as an "elderly yachtsman", thinking to spend the war in charge of a drifter or a motor 
minesweeper. He was sent to Normandy  as a correspondent in 1944, on the afternoon of D-Day. "The 
beach was littered with wrecked landing craft and shot up vehicles, and yet it did not look too bad," 
Shute wrote in his account. On the next morning, he went ashore, took a lot of photographs, and talked with 
soldiers, and French laborers, who told that the bombardment had  killed ten and wounded twenty. "I was 
amazed to hear the numbers were so low, having seen the destruction of the front..." In 1945 Shute 
went to India and Burma as a correspondent for the Ministry of Information. Although his writings were 
not published, his experiences provided material for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Chequer Board</span> (1947), in which 
a former officer flies to Burma to look up a British pilot he had met  in a military hospital. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He glanced around the ice-cream parlour.
'If everything you want to do works out like this,' he said slowly,
'you'll have a town as good as Alice Springs in no time.' </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">'That's what I want to have,' she said. 'A town like Alice.'"</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">A Town Like Alice</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>From 1950 on, Shute lived permanently in Australia, settling on a
farm at Langwarrin, Victoria. His later novels were mostly set in his
new home country, among them <i>A Town Like Alice</i>. As in <i>Pied Piper</i>,
Shute uses a narrator, who relates the story of the central characters
to readers. It tells of Jean Paget, a London typist, and her trek from
Japanese-occupied Malaya to the Australian outback. In Malaya during
her imprisonment she befriends Joe Harman, an Australian ringer, who
steals five chickens for women prisoners and is crucified in
punishment. After the war she hears Joe is still alive. They meet again
and start their life together in Willstown. The book was based on a
real-life incident. Shute expected to be accused of falsifying history
and wrote in the author's note: "After the conquest of Malaya in 1942
the Japanese invaded Sumatra and quickly took the island. A party of
about eighty Dutch women and children were collected in the vicinity of
Padang. The local Japanese commander was reluctant to assume the
responsibility for these women and, to solve his problem, marched them
out of his area; so began a trek all round Sumatra which lasted for two
and a half years. At the end of this vast journey less than thirty of
them were still alive." </p>
<p><i>On the Beach </i>was a pessimistic and pathetic tale of the
atomic age. In the
novel the feared nuclear war has eliminated all life in the northern
hemisphere, leaving Australia to await the inevitable spread of
radioactive contamination, that will end the rest of the human life on
Earth. Shute depicts people faced with inevitable doom, but his
characters are not desperate, though they know that their death is only
a matter of time. They try to spend their last months
normally, planning garden works for the next ten years, going to work,
watching Grand Prix races, learning to type. A Morse code signal from
the devasted U.S. turns out to be a false alarm:&nbsp; a submarine crew
discovers that it is generated accidentally as a windblown soda bottle
taps a telegraph key. The hopeless relationship
between U.S. Navy Captain Dwight Towers and Moira Davidson, the
middle-aged daughter of a stockbreeder, ends in their separation:
Towers takes his nuclear submarine to the sea. At the end Australian
government handles out cyanide pills to its citizens. Moira takes a
pill
from a red box, as do Mary and Peter, a young couple with their
daughter Jennifer. </p>
<blockquote>The theme of the end of the world 
has been subject in many novels throughout literary history. 
<a href="mshelley.htm">Mary Shelley</a> wrote in 1826 a gloomy Great 
Plague story <i>The Last Man</i>, the atomic bomb was depicted in 
<a href="hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>'s <i>The World Set Free 
</i>(1914), and apocalyptic visions have inspired  a number of films and books  from different genres, from 
<a href="vonnegut.htm">Kurt Vonnegut</a> Jr's <i>Cat's Cradle</i> 
(1963) and James Blish's <i>The Triumph of Time </i>(1958) 
to Bernard Malamud's <i>God's Grace </i>(1982) and Margaret Atwood's <i>Oryx &amp; Crake</i> (2003).  Years after the shooting of Dick Powell's movie <i>The Conqueror </i>(1956)
in Utah near a nuclear test site, several members of the cast and crew,
including Powell, John Wayne, Susan Hayward, and Agnes Moore, were
stricken by cancer. For further reading: <i>The End of the World</i>, ed. by Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, 
Joseph D. Olander (1983).</blockquote>
<p>The film version of <i>On the Beach</i> (1959), directed by Stanley
Kramer, was set in the year 1964. Stanley Kramer wanted to make a
picture that reflected the primary hopes and fears of the era; this
stand prompted Pentagon in refusing to lend an atomic submarine to the
production company. Nevil Shute himself boycotted the entire venture;
he was not happy with Kramer's interpretation of the novel and the
script. </p>
<p>Gregory Peck played the commander of a U.S. nuclear submarine that
lands in Australia, the only country that has not yet been wiped out by
atomic fallout. He has a desperate affair with Ava Gardner &#8211; and he
must decide whether to die with Gardner in Australia or go back to
America so that his men can die on home soil. Gardner tells reporters:
for making a picture about the end of the world, "this is the place to
do it." Fred Astaire was casted in the role of a disillusioned
scientist whose message is that if we have nuclear weapons, they will
be used, intentionally or by accident. "Waltzing Matilda" plays
throughout the film. An abandoned banner is seen at the end, reading
"There is still time... Brother". <i>The New York Daily News</i> <font size="2">(December 18, 1959) </font>condemned
the movie on political grounds: "This is a would-be shocker which plays
right up the alley of a) the Kremlin and b) the Western defeatists
and/or traitors who yelp for the scrapping of the H-bomb. ... See this
picture if you must (it seems bound to be much talked about), but keep
in mind that the thinking it represents points the way toward eventual
Communist enslavement of the entire human race." </p>
<p>Shute was a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. During his 30
years long career as writer, he published 25 books, mostly fiction but
also nonfiction, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Slide Rule</span>
(1954), a book of memoirs. Its title refers to a calculating device
used by engineers before pocket calculators and computers. "Like many
men today, after two wars I have been in danger too often to bother
very much about being killed," he wrote, "and when it comes I would
prefer that it should happen in an aeroplane, since aeroplanes have
been the best part of my life." After finishig his autobiography, Shute
began working on an unfinished novella from 1946-47, entitled<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Seafarers</span>. This work was not published until 2002. Shute  died of a cerebral haemorrhage on January 12, 1960, in East Melbourne. </p>
