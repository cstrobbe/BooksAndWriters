<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American lyrical poet, a recluse, nicknamed the "nun of Amherst" &#8211; only seven of Dickinson's
some 1800 poems were published during her lifetime, five of them in the 
<i>Springfield Republican</i>. Dickinson never married. She withdrew from social contact  and devoted herself in secret into writing. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>I felt a Cleaving in my Mind &#8211;  </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">As if my Brain had split &#8211;  </font><br>
<font size="2">I tried to match it &#8211;  Seam by Seam &#8211;  </font><br>
<font size="2">But could not make them fit. </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>The thought behind, I strove to join </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Unto the thought before &#8211;  </font><br>
<font size="2">But Sequence ravelled out of Sound </font><br>
<font size="2">Like Balls &#8211;  upon a Floor. </font></b><font size="2"></font></blockquote>

<p>Emily Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a family well
known for educational and political activity. Her father, an orthodox
Calvinist, was a lawyer and treasurer of the local college. He also
served in Congress. Dickinson's mother, whose name was also Emily, was
a cold, religious, hard-working housewife, who suffered from
depression. Her relationship with her daughter was distant. Later
Dickinson wrote in a letter, that she never had a mother. </p>
<p>Dickinson was educated at Amherst Academy (1834-47), where she ot a
good scientific education, and Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (1847-48).
Around 1850 she began to compose poems &#8211; "Awake ye muses nine, sing me
a strain divine, / Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!" she
said in her earliest known poem, dated March 4, 1850. It was published
in <i>Springfield Daily Republican</i> in 1852. </p>
<p>The style of her first efforts was fairly conventional, but after
years of practice she began to give room for experiments. Often written
in the metre of hymns, her poems did not only deal with with issues of
death, faith and immortality, but with nature, domesticity, and the
power and limits of language. From c.1858 Dickinson assembled many of
her poems in packets of 'fascicles', which she bound herself with
needle and thread. A selection of these poems appeared in 1890. </p>

<p>In 1862 Dickinson started her life long correspondence and friendship 
with  Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1823-1911)<b>, </b>a writer and 
reformer, who commanded during the Civil War the first troop of 
African-American soldiers. Higginson later  published <i>Army Life in a Black 
Regiment</i> in 1870.  On of the four poems he received from Dickinson was the famous 'Safe in their Alabaster Chambers.' </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Safe in their alabaster chambers, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Untouched by morning and untouched by noon, </font><br>
<font size="2">Sleep the meek members of the resurrection, </font><br>
<font size="2">Rafter of satin, and roof of stone. </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine; </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Babbles the bee in a stolid ear; </font><br>
<font size="2">Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence &#8211; </font><br>
<font size="2">Ah, what sagacity perished here! </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Grand go the years in the crescent above them; </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row, </font><br>
<font size="2">Diadems drop and Doges surrender, </font><br>
<font size="2">Soundless as dots on a disk of snow. </font></b><font size="2"></font></blockquote><p>Although
Higginson was astounded by Dickinson's originality and encouraged her
literary aspirations, he advised her not to publish. He called Emily
"my partially cracked poetess at Amherst". Dickinson's decision to
follow the advise was influenced by her ambivalent attitude toward her
role as a woman writer and desire to protect her privacy, to live in
her self-impised exile. She was grateful to Higginson for his editorial
suggestions, but did not follow them blindly. </p>

<p>After the Civil War Dickinson restricted her contacts outside Amherst 
to exchange of letters, dressed only in white and saw few of the visitors 
who came to meet her. In fact, most of her time she spent in her room. 
During her most productive years, she almost wrote a poem a day. 
Meanwhile, 
outside, the battle between her brother Austin, who lived next door to her house, 
and rest of the family continued. Austin Dickinson (1829-1895) was a  lawyer, 
married to a cultivated woman, Susan Gilbert, by whom he had three children. 
In his early 50s he  entered into an affair with Mabel Loomis Todd, who was married to 
an Amherst professor. 
The affair continued until his death, and was a permanent source of gossips for the community. Emily 
called her "Lady Macbeth of Amherst".
</p>
<p>Although Dickinson lived secluded life, her letters 
reveal knowledge of the writings of <a href="jkeats.htm">John Keats</a>,
John Ruskin, and Sir Thomas Browne. Most important writers for her were
Shakespeare, Elizabeth Browning, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, George
Eliot, and George Sand. </p>
<p>Dickinson's emotional life remains mysterious, despite much
speculation about a possible disappointed love affair. Two candidates
have been presented: Reverend Charles Wadsworth, with whom she
corresponded, and Samuel Bowles, editor of the <i>Springfield Republican</i>,
to whom she addressed many poems. In 1861-62 she had a crisis; it is
not known if she ever fully recovered. Wadsworth had moved to San
Francisco and Bowles disappointed her by traveling in 1861 to Europe.
He returned in Autumn 1862. At that time Dickinson did not want to meet
him or write to him any more. </p>
<p>Dickinson's father died in 1874. Her mother, who had a stroke, died
in 1882. During this period Judge Otis Lord, a friend and colleague of
her father, brought some love into Dickinson's life. Lord was a widower
and 18 years her senior.</p>


<p>Emily Dickinson died at the age of fifty-five on May 15, 1886. She
had suffered from Bright's disease since 1884. "I almost wish there was
no Eternity," she had written in her youth. "To think that we must
forever live and never cease to be." After Dickinson's death Susan
Gilbert tried to get her poems published but failed. Eventually a
selection was brought out by Mabel Todd and T. W. Higginson. Lavinia
destroyed most of Dickinson's correspondence. Despite its editorial
imperfections, the first
volume became popular and was followed by<i> Poems: Second Series </i>(1891) and <i> Poems: Third Series</i> (1896). In the early decades of the twentieth century,
Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the poet's niece, transcribed and published
more poems. <i>Bolts of Melody</i>  (1945) essentially completed the task
of bringing oeuvre to the public. </p>

<p>The publication of Thomas H. Johnson's edition of Emily Dickinson's
poems finally gave readers a complete and accurate text. Johnson's work
was not made easier that the author had left alternative versions of
words, lines and sometimes of whole poems. Johnson found a valuable
assistant in Theodora Ward, who was then completing an edition of
Dickinson's letters to her grandparents. As editor of Emily Dickinson's <i>Selected Poems</i> (1924), <a href="caiken.htm">Conrad Aiken</a> (1889-1973) was largely responsible for establishing her posthumous literary reputation. </p>

<p>Dickinson's work has had a considerable influence on modern poetry.
Her frequent use of dashes, sporadic capitalization
of nouns, off-rhymes, broken metre, unconventional metaphors have
contributed her reputation as one of the most innovative poets of
19th-century American literature. Amherst has became a pilgrimage for
her fans and aspiring lyricists, her life and work has attracted a
number of scholars, and like <a href="splath.htm">Sylvia Plath</a>,
her dedication to her art has inspired feminist writers. Dickinson is
also one of those poets whose words have given much comfort for people
who have mental problems. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Hope is the thing with feathers</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">That perches in the soul,</font><br>
<font size="2">And sings the tune without the words</font><br>
<font size="2">And never stops at all,</font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>And sweetest in the gale is heard;</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And sore must be the storm</font><br>
<font size="2">That could abash the little bird</font><br>
<font size="2">That kept so many warm.</font></b></blockquote>


<blockquote><font size="2"><b>I've heard it in the chillest land,</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And on the strangest sea;</font><br>
<font size="2">Yet, never, in extremity,</font><br>
<font size="2">It asked a crumb of me. </font></b><font size="2"></font></blockquote>

<p>Later feminist critic have challenged the popular conception of the
poet as reclusive, eccentric figure, and underlined her intellectual
struggle and passive aggressiveness. Her verse is full of allusions to
volcanoes, shipwrecks, funerals, and other manifestations of natural
and human violence, which she hide into her writings. Pain and extreme
psychic feelings were among her central themes; according to some
researchers she may have been epileptic. In a letter she wrote to
Higginson, "I had a terror &#8211; since September &#8211; I could tell to none &#8211;
and so I sing as the Boy does by the Burying Ground &#8211; because I am
afraid." </p>
<p>Scholars have explored 
 Dickinson's relationship with her sister-in-law, Sue Gilbert, her admiration 
for the English poet <a href="ebrownin.htm">Elisabeth Barrett Browning</a> 
(1806-1861)  and her affection for US writer Helen Hunt Jackson 
(1830-1885). Dickinson read  voraciously and called poets "the dearest ones of time, 
the strongest friends of soul." Judith Farr have pointed out that she spoke of the <i>soul</i> 
or <i>souls </i>141 in her poems. Soul was for her a lost boat, an internal lamp, a storm within, 
an emperor. "The Soul unto itself / Is an imperial friend &#8211; / Or the most agonizing Spy / 
An Enemy &#8211; could send &#8211; " <b></b><font size="2"></font></p>
