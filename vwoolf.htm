<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->British author who made an
original contribution to the form of the novel &#8211; also distinguished
feminist essayist, critic in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>,
and a central figure of Bloomsbury group. Virginia Woolf's books were
published by Hogarth Press, which she founded with her husband, the
critic and writer Leonard Woolf. Originally their printing machine was
small enough to fit on a kitchen table, but their publications later
included T.S. Eliot's <i>Waste Land </i>(1922),
fiction by Maxim Gorky, E.M. Forster, and Katherine Mansfield, and the
complete twenty-four-volume translation of the works of Sigmund Freud. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Have you any notion how many books
are
written about women in the course of one year? Have you any notion how
many are written by men? Are you aware that you are, perhaps, the most
discussed animal in the universe?"</b> (in <i>A Room of One's Own</i>,
1929) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Virginia Woolf was born in London, the daughter of Julia
Jackson
Duckworth, a member of the Duckworth publishing family, and Sir Leslie
Stephen, a literary critic, a friend of Meredith, Henry James,
Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, and George Eliot, and the founder of the <i>Dictionary
of National Biography</i>.
Leslie Stephen's first wife had been the daughter of the novelist
William Makepeace Thackeray. His daughter Laura from the first marriage
was institutionalized because of mental retardation. In a memoir dated
1907 she wrote of her parents, "Beautiful often, even to our eyes, were
their gestures, their glances of pure and unutterable delight in each
other." </p>
      <p>Woolf, who was educated at home, grew up at the family home at
Hyde
Park Gate. From her early age, she was extremely attached to her
father. In middle age she described this period in a letter to Vita
Sackville-West: "Think how I was brought up! No school; mooning about
alone among my father's books; never any chance to pick up all that
goes on in schools&#8212;throwing balls; ragging; slang; vulgarities; scenes;
jealousies!" Woolf's youth was shadowed by series of emotional shocks.
Gerald Duckworth, her half-brother, sexually abused her. In 'Sketch of
the Past' (1939) she wrote: "I can remember the feel of his hands going
under my clothes; going firmly and steadily lower and lower, I remember
how I hoped that he would stop; how I stiffened and wriggled as his
hand approached my private parts. But he did not stop." </p>
      <p>Julia Jackson Duckworth died from a bout of influenza, when
Virginia
was in her early teens. She never had a close relationship with her
mother &#8211; "Can I remember," she once asked, "being alone with her for
more than a few minutes." Stella Duckworth, her half sister, took her
mother's place, but died a scant two years later. Leslie Stephen
suffered a slow death from stomach cancer, he died in 1904. When
Virginia's brother Thoby died in 1906, she had a prolonged mental
breakdown. Vanessa, Virginia's sister, influenced a number of her
characters; in childhood they bathed and slept together. Later in <em>Flush</em>
(1933) Woolf parodies her own devotion to Vanessa. </p>
      <p>Following the death of her father, Woolf moved with her sister
and
two brothers to the house in Bloomsbury. Vanessa, a painter, agreed to
marry the critic of art and literature Clive Bell. He was the only
person, whom she trusted sufficiently to show her unfinished work.
Virginia's economic situation improved when she inherited £2,500 from
an aunt. Their house became central to activities of the Bloomsbury
group. "And part of the charm of those Thursday evenings was that they
were astonishingly abstract. It was not only that Moore's book
[Principia Ethica, 1903] had set us all discussing philosophy, art,
religion; it was that the atmosphere &#8211; if in spite of Hawtrey I may use
that word &#8211; was abstract in the extreme. The young men I have named had
no 'manners' in the Hyde Park Gate sense. They criticized our arguments
as severely as their own. They never seemed to notice how we were
dressed or if we were nice looking or not."<font size="2"> (in</font><i><font size="2"> Moments of Being</font></i><font size="2">, ed.&nbsp; Jeanne
Schulkind, 1976)</font> </p>
      <p>From 1905 Woolf began to
write for the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>. With Vanessa and
Violet Dickinson she traveled in 1906 to Greece, where she carried
Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>
in her handbag. In 1912 she married the political theorist Leonard
(Sidney) Woolf (1880-1969), who had returned from serving as an
administrator in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Not long after the wedding,
she told to friend that the charms of orgasm had been exaggerated.
Leonard Woolf<b> </b>was
of Jewish descent, the son of a barrister. Woolf had anti-Jewish
attitudes, but she loved her husband, who as her caretaker followed in
the footsteps of Vanessa Bell and Leslie Stephen. Leonard Woolf had
studied at Cambridge and from 1923 to 1930 he was a literary editor on
the
      <i>Nation</i>. During WW I he was not called for military
service,
most likely due to his constantly trembling hands. Most of the
Bloomsburies were conscientious objectors.</p>
      <p>In 1917 Leonard set up a small hand press at Hogarth House,
working as its director until his death.
The tiny Hogarth Press had in 1919 the opportunity to publish the early
chapters of <i>Ulysses</i>.
Virginia Woolf turned them down: she did not like Joyce's use of
dashes. Leonard Woolf's own books include novels, non-fiction, and his
five volume
memoirs <i>Sowing </i>(1960), <i>Growing </i>(1961), <i>Beginning
Again </i>
(1964), <i>Downhill All the Way </i>(1967), and <i>The Journey Not
the Arrival Matters </i>(1969).</p>
      <p><em>The Voyage Out </em> (1915) was Virginia Woolf's first
novel.
Set in South America, it tells of the emotions of tourists somewhere
near the Amazon River. The whole scene is imaginary; Woolf had never
been there, but the story can be read as an allegory of artistic
creation. This work, which received mixed reviews, was followed by <em>Night
and Day</em> (1919), a realistic novel about the lives of two friends,
Katherine and Mary. <em>Jacob's Room</em>&nbsp; (1922) was based upon
the life and death of her brother Thoby. </p>
      <p>With <em>To the Lighthouse</em> (1927) and <em>The Waves</em>
(1931) Woolf established herself as one of the leading writers of
modernism. On the publication of <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, Lytton
Strachey wrote: "It is really most unfortunate that she rules out
copulation &#8211; not the ghost of it visible &#8211; so that her presentation of
things becomes little more... than an arabesque &#8211; an exquisite
arabesque, of course." <i>The Waves</i>
is perhaps Woolf's most difficult novel. It follows in soliloquies the
lives of six persons from childhood to old age. Louis Kronenberger
noted in <i>The New York Times</i> that Woolf was not really concerned
with people, but "the poetic symbols, of life--the changing seasons,
day and night, bread and wine, fire and cold, time and space, birth and
death and change." </p>
      <p>Woolf's mood swings, depression, physical ailments, headaches,
and
other symptoms are in current psychiatric parlance considered
"psychosomatic", which include the so-called neurasthenic syndromes.
Much of her writing reflected her inner conflicts. Woolf developed
innovative literary techniques in order to reveal women's experience
and find an alternative to the dominating views of reality. In her
essay 'Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown' Woolf argued that John Galsworthy,
H.G. Wells and other realistic English novelist dealt in surfaces but
to get underneath these surfaces one must use less restricted
presentation of life, and such devices as stream of consciousness and
interior monologue and abandon linear narrative. Marital
disappointments and frustrations she often dealt ironically. In <i>To
the Lighthouse</i> Woolf wrote: "So that is marriage, Lily thought, a
man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball." </p>
      <p><em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> (1925) formed a web of boring and
depressing thoughts of several groups of people. Like Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>,
the action takes place in a single day, in this case in June in 1923.
There is little action, but much movement in time from present to past
and back again. The central figure, Clarissa Dalloway, married to
Richard Dalloway, is a wealthy London hostess, who spends her day in
London preparing for her evening party. Clarissa recalls her life
before World War I, her friendship with the unconventional Sally Seton,
and her relationship with Peter Walsh. At her party she never meets the
shell-shocked veteran Septimus Smith, one of the first Englishmen to
enlist in the war. Sally returns as Lady Rossetter, Peter Walsh is
still enamored with Mrs. Dalloway, the prime minister arrives, and
Smith commits suicide. <i>To the Lighthouse</i> had a tripartite
structure: part 1 presented the Victorian family life, the second part
covers a ten-year period, and the third part is a long account of a
morning and reconciliation.
The central figure, Mrs. Ramsay, was based on Woolf's mother. Also
other characters in the book were drawn from Woolf's family memories. </p>
      <p>During the inter-war period, Woolf was a central character of
the literary scene both in London and at her home in Rodmell, near
Lewes, Sussex. She lived in Richmond from 1915 to 1924, in Bloomsbury
from 1924 to 1939, and maintained the house in Rodmell from 1919-41.
Their Hogarth Press had operated from the basement room in Tavistock
Square. The Bloomsbury group was initially based at the Gordon Square
residence of Virginia and her sister Vanessa (Bell). Its other members
included among others <a href="forster.htm">E.M. Forster</a>, Lytton
Strachey, Clive Bell, Duncan Grant, and Leonard Woolf. The
consolidation of the group's beliefs in unifying aesthetic concerns
occurred under the influence of the philosopher G.E. Moore (1873-1958).
By the early 1930s, the group ceased to exist in its original form.</p>
      <p>Since 1924, the Hogarth Press had published works by Sigmund
Freud.
Woolf met him in 1939, and later wrote in her diary: "A screwed up
shrunk very old man: with a monkey&#8217;s light eyes, paralyzed spasmodic
movements, inarticulate: but alert&#8230;" In the event of a Nazi invastion,
Woolf and Leonard had made provisions to kill themselves. After the
final attack of mental illness, Woolf loaded her pockets full of stones
and drowned herself in the River Ouse, near her Sussex home, on March
28, 1941. On her note to her husband she wrote: "I have a feeling I
shall go mad. I cannot go on longer in these terrible times. I hear
voices and cannot concentrate on my work. I have fought against it but
cannot fight any longer. I owe all my happiness to you but cannot go on
and spoil your life." Woolf's suicide, like Sylvia Plath's, has much
colored the interpretation of both of their work. </p>
      <p>Virginia Woolf's concern with feminist thematics is dominant
in <em>A Room of One's Own</em> (1929). In it she made her famous
statement: "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to
write fiction."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>The
book originated from two expanded and revised lectures the author
presented at Cambridge University's Newnham and Girton Colleges in
October 1928. Woolf examined the obstacles and prejudices that have
hindered women writers. She separated women as <i>objects </i>of
representation and women as <i>authors </i>of
representation, and argued that a change in the forms of literature was
necessary because most literature had been "made by men out of their
own needs for their own uses." In the last chapter Woolf touched the
possibility of an androgynous mind. Woolf refers to Coleridge who said
that a great mind is androgynous and states that when this fusion takes
place the mind is fully fertilized and uses all its faculties. "Perhaps
a mind that is purely masculine cannot create, any more than a mind
that is purely feminine..." <em>Three Guineas</em> (1938) urged women
to make a claim for their own history and literature. </p>
      <p><em>Orlando</em> (1928), a fantasy novel, traced the career of
the androgynous protagonist, Orlando, from a masculine identity within
the Elizabethan court to a feminine identity in 1928. Chief model for
the character was writer <a href="sackvill.htm">Vita Sackville-West</a>,
with whom Woolf had a lesbian relationship.&nbsp;Violet (Keppel)
Trefusis, who&nbsp;had a passionate relationship with Vita, was Sasha,
named after a white Russian fox Orlando had had as a boy, "a creature
soft as snow, but with teeth of steel, which bit him so savagely that
his father had it killed." The book was illustrated with pictures of
Vita Sackville-West, dressed as Orlando. According to Nigel Nicolson,
the initiative to start the affair came as much on Virginia's side as
on the more experienced Vita's. Their relationship coincided with a
period of great creative productivity in Woolf's career. In 1994 Eileen
Atkins dramatized their letters in her play <i>Vita and Virginia</i>,
starring Atkins and Vanessa Redgrave. </p>
      <p>As an essayist Woolf was prolific. She published some 500
essays in
periodicals and collections, beginning 1905. To find her own voice, she
read and wrote voraciously, but it was not until Woolf was middle-aged
she felt confident in her craft. Characteristic for Woolf's essays are
dialogic nature of style &#8211; her reader is often directly addressed, in a
conversational tone. A number of her writings are autobiographical. In
the essay on the art of <a href="sickert.htm">Walter Sickert</a>,
which was inspired by her visit in his retrospective show, Woolf asked
how words can express colour, and answered that all great writers are
great colorists: "Each of Shakespeare's plays has its dominant colour.
And each writers differs of course as a colourist..."<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">Walter Sickert: A Conversation</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">1934). </font>Woolf rejection of an authoritative voice
links her essays to the tradition of <a href="michelde.htm">Montaigne</a>.
