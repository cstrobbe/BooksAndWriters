<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American mystery writer and a rabbi, famous
for his series about the wise Rabbi David Small. Kemelman's hero is a
master of theological discourse and an analyst of human behavior.
Small's logic, learned from the Talmud, plays an important part in the
plots. During the process of solving murder cases, he reveals ethical
problems and ethnic prejudices in America and introduces the reader to
informally to Jewish life and philosophy. Kemelman's books, which has
been translated into several languages, can be enjoyed without much
knowledge of Jewish culture. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Religion!" The Rabbi was scornful. "Religion with 
us is ethical conduct..." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Wednesday 
the Rabbi Got Wet</font></i><font size="2">, 1976) </font></blockquote>

<p>Harry Kemelman was born in Boston, Massachusetts,  the son of Isaac and Dora (Prizer) Kemelman. 
His parents had settled in Boston when they emigrated from Russia. Although they were not particularly 
religious, they decided to give their son a through education in Hebrew schools. Kemelman has confessed 
that he was not very enthusiastic about spending afternoons in classrooms, but at the age of eleven he 
became interested in Talmud, and found the debates lead by a rabbi inspiring. After  
attending Boston Latin School from 1920 to 1926, he studied English literature at Boston University, 
receiving 
in 1930 his A.B. In 1931, he earned  a Harvard M.A. in English philology. Kemelman had early 
decided to pursue a career in literature but  during the depression years he had to postpone his 
plans when he was unable to get a college teaching position.  From 1935 to 1941, 
he worked as a teacher in several Boston high schools. "... I had to hold as many as 
four teaching jobs simultaneously to make up one inadequate salary", he later said. 
In 1936, Kemelman married Anne Kessin, a medical secretary-technician born 
in Denmark; they had three children. </p>
<p>Kemelman taught from 1938 to 1940 at Manter Hall School, Cambridge, 
and from 1938 to 1941 at North-eastern University Evening Division. 
During World War II,  Kemelman served a chief wage administrator in the 
United States Army Transportation Corps. He then worked  for War Assets 
Administration in 1948-49, and as a free-lance writer and a private businessman. 
In 1963, Kemelman was appointed assistant professor of English at the Franklin 
Technical Institute in Boston. Kemelman was also an assistant professor at Boston 
State College in the 1960s. </p>

<p>Kemelman's early stories appeared in <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</i>. 
His first hero, a white-haired New England college professor named Nicky Welt, 
solved a crime case on the basis of the overheard remark, "A nine-mile walk 
is no picnic, especially in the rain." After writing about half a dozen stories, Kemelman 
lost his interest in them. The Nicky Welt stories were collected as <i>The Nine-Mile Walk</i>, 
which appeared in 1967. Welt is born around the turn of the century. His "pupil" and 
chronicler of his cases in the District Attorney of Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Every Friday 
night they play chess. The evening is concluded with the solution to a mystery Welt has 
described before the game starts. Welt is the embodiment of an armchair detective &#8211; 
he do not use orthodox police methods but pure logic, 
as <a href="futrell.htm">Jacques Futrelle</a>'s professor Van Dusen, 
called the Thinking Machine. </p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Kemelman wrote a novel about a community of Jews in  
New England. He had moved with his family to the small Yankee town of Marblehead, 
twenty miles north of Boston. The new surroundings gave material for his book  <i>The Building 
of the Temple</i>. Kemelman tried to sell it without success to get a synagogue built. 
Arthur Fields, editor at Crows Publishers, suggested that Kemelman would add detective 
elements into it. It was rewritten and published as his first rabbi David Small story, 
<i>Friday the Rabbi Slept Late</i>. The novel, in which Rabbi Small
solves the murder of a young girl, whose body is found in his car,
become a success and received in 1964 Edgar Allan Poe Award from the
Mystery Writers of America. Kemelman also received $35,000 for the
movie rights. <i>Lanigan's Rabbi</i>, NBC's Mystery Movie series 
from 1977, was based on Kemelman's  novels.  Art Carney played Chief 
Paul Lanigan and Bruce Solomon was Rabbi David Small. Kemelman last  Rabbi book, 
<i>The Day the Rabbi Left Town </i>was published in 1996. Kemelman died in 1996, 
at the age of 88, in Marblehead, Massachusetts. </p>

<p>David Small is the unconventional leader of the conservative Jewish
congregation in the suburban Massachusetts town of Barnard's Crossing,
Boston. He has wisdom and all the good qualities of a detective
sharpened by the Talmudic training, or as he says, as a Talmudist, "I
am not entirely without legal training." He is a devoted husband to his
wife and he has two well behaving children. Usually Small is drawn into
the events when he tries to help a friend in trouble. Other major
characters include Hugh Lanigan, the Irish-Catholic police chief. The
two friends often discuss religion over a cup of tea. Small ages
realistically during the series. He has much troubles with his
congregation and he is constantly at odds with its powerful members. In
Small's first case a body of a young woman is found on the grounds of
the Temple. Small's car has been seen at the Temple at the time of the
murder. The woman has been strangled and evidence points to the Rabbi &#8211;
her purse is found in his car. Small is not a serious suspect and
eventually he proves himself innocent. He also becomes a friend of Hugh
Lanigan, and ensures renewal of his contract. After several stories,
Small takes a job as a college teacher in <i>The Day the Rabbi Resigned  
</i>(1992).  Rabbi Small also visits Israel twice: first in <i>Monday 
</i><i></i><i>The Rabbi Took Off </i>(1972), and then in <i>One Fine Day 
the Rabbi Bought a Cross</i> (1987). </p>

<p>In <i>Saturday the Rabbi Went Hungry </i>(1966) Small's congregation believes 
that he has buried a suicide in the temple's cemetery. <i>Sunday, the Rabbi Stayed 
Home</i> (1969) deals with drugs and militants &#8211; one of Small's temple board 
members, a businessman, is rumored to be pushing drugs and there is a group of 
young people who question conservative values. The book also gives extensive 
details about the Passover celebration. <i>Monday the Rabbi Took Off </i>(1972) 
takes Rabbi David Small  to Israel, where an international incident involves a 
young American student, Israeli intelligence, and a group of Arab terrorists. </p>

<p>In <i>Tuesday the Rabbi Saw Red Small </i>(1973) Small goes to teach a 
course on Jewish thought at a small community college, where the idyllic front 
is shattered by a bomb which goes  off in the dean's office. <i>Wednesday the 
Rabbi Got Wet</i>  (1976) brings on the scene a hurricane and pharmacy. Also a member Small's 
congregation, an invalid, dies a mysterious death.  Small becomes fully involved with the crime 
case on page 257 of a 288-page book. The plot weaves together mystical religious 
sects,  the different roles of mysticism in the Jewish and Christian faiths, 
and malpractice suits.  "With us, however, faith in the Christian sense 
is almost meaningless, since God is by definition unknowable... Our religion 
is a code of ethical behavior." <font size="2">(from <i>Wednesday the 
Rabbi Got Wet</i>)</font>. <i>Conversations with Rabbi Small </i>(1981) dispenses with a murder mystery. It tells of a  
girl who appears at Small's cabin door, wanting to know if the Rabbi would convert 
her to Judaism. Rabbi Small offers her a personal lecture into the truths and the 
fables of the world's oldest religion. </p>
<p><i>Someday the Rabbi Will Leave </i>(1985) deals with  political corruption and 
dirty campaign tricks, blackmail, and a possible murder. There are also problems 
in Small's own temple.  <i>One Fine Day the Rabbi Bought a Cross </i>(1987) 
was about Small's   and Miriam's trip to the Holy Land. There Small faces 
the beliefs of  a controversial fundamentalist Jewish group. An American 
tourist is killed, weapons are sold, and Small finds it  difficult to 
get answers  amidst Middle Eastern mysticism and intrigue. <i>The Day 
the Rabbi Resigned</i> (1992) continues Small's  eternal battle with his 
fractious congregation at Barnard's Crossing.  A drunk-driving accident 
is not an accident and now Small is really quitting. <i>The Day the Rabbi 
Left Town </i>(1996) depicts Small's situation after his new life. He has 
retired and accepted a teaching job at nearby Windermere College. This 
time Kemelman focuses more on  the history, customs, and practices of 
Judaism than writing a mystery novel &#8211; the murder occurs late in the 
story. </p>
