      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Novelist, playwright,
historian,
and short story writer, a former nobleman who immigrated to
western Europe after the Bolshevik Revolution. Tolstoi returned to
Russia in 1923. Nicknamed "Comrade Count" he was a supporter of
Communist Party and honored artist receiving three Stalin Prizes. His
two-part historical&nbsp;play on Ivan the Terrible&nbsp;Tolstoi wrote
clearly to please Stalin. The Nobel writer <a href="rolland.htm">Romain
Rolland </a>admired the power of Tolstoi's novels and&nbsp;said to
him: </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What particularly impresses me
about your strong and truthful art is the way you mould your personages
in their particular surroundings. They seem to constitute an
inalienable part of the air, earth, and light which surround and
nourish them, and you have the knack of expressing the finest tints of
the environment with one stroke of the brush." </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Aleksei Tolstoi was born in Nikolaevsk (now Pugachyov), in
Samara Province, into an aristocratic family distantly related to Lev
Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev. He grew up without knowing his real father,
Count Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tolstoi, who was a member of the elite of
Russian society and a wealthy landowner. His mother,
Alexandra&nbsp;Leont'eva Turgeneva, was a minor literary
figure.&nbsp;While pregnant with&nbsp;Aleksei,&nbsp;she left her
husband and three children, and moved with Aleksei Apollonovich Bostrom
to a farm in the Samara region. </p>
      <p>Bostrom brought&nbsp;Tolstoi as his own child. Count Tolstoi,
who&nbsp;died in 1900,&nbsp;never saw his son, but acknowledged
paternity and left provision for him in his will. Until the age of 13,
Tolstoi was educated at home, then at a secondary school in Samara
(1894-1901), and at St. Petersgurg Technological Institute (1901-08).
In 1902 he married Julia Rozhansky; they had two children. While in
Germany, he met&nbsp; Sophia Dymshits. After leaving Julia, she became
his common-law wife. </p>
      <p>Tolstoi's first literary experiments were born under the
influence of the Symbolist movement, but from poetry he soon turned to
prose. In 1907 he published a collection of symbolist poems, <i>Lirika</i>.
Among his early works were some realistic short stories depicting his
childhood. As a writer Tolstoi made his breakthrough with a series of
novels exploring the historical process of the impoverishment of the
nobility's country estates and the spiritual decline of their owners. </p>
      <p>Between the years 1914 and 1916 Tolstoi served as a war
correspondent for the liberal newspaper <i>Russkie vedomosti</i>,
sided with the Whites. He made several visits to the Front line, and
travelled in France and England. Tolstoi's war experiences formed the
background of <i>Na voyne </i>(1914-16), a collection of stories. In
1917 Tolstoi worked for General Anton Denikin's propaganda section.
Though he welcomed the February revolution he was unable to accept
the&nbsp;Bolshevist October Revolution,&nbsp;and emigrated in
1918&nbsp;with his family to Paris. A few years later he went&nbsp;to
Berlin where he joined a pro-Communist <i>émigré</i> group and became
the editor of the Bolshevik newspaper <i>Nakanune</i>. With the
introduction of the New Economic Policy in Russia and a change in his
political beliefs, Tolstoi broke with the emigre circles and returned
with his family to his homeland. From West Tolstoy brought with him to
the novel <i>Syostry</i> (1922), the first part of his trilogy <i>Road
to Calvary </i>(1922-42). </p>
      <p>After an uneasy period, when he was suspected because of his
aristocratic origins, Tolstoi established himself among the leading
Soviet writers. During the 1920s Tolstoi wrote several plays, including
adaptations of works by <a href="oneill.htm">Eugene O'Neill </a>and <a href="capek.htm">Carel Capek</a>. He participated in the anti-fascist
congress in Paris and London in 1935-36 and took part in the 2nd
International Congress of Writers in Madrid during the Spanish Civil
war (1936). In 1936 he was elected Chairman of the Writer's Union and a
deputy to the Supreme Soviet in 1937. Two years later he was elected
member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. During World War II he served
as a journalist and propagandist. His patriotic articles were collected
in <i>Chto my zashchishchayem</i> (1942) and <i>Rodina</i> (1943).
Tolstoi died in Moscow on February 23, 1945. </p>
      <p>Tolstoi's major works include <i>Nikita's Childhood</i>
(1922), a lyrical story with autobiographical elements of a childhood
in a Russian village, and <i>Road to Calvary</i>, about the life of
four people, sisters Dasha and Katia, and Telgin and Roshchin, from the
eve of World War I to end of the Russian Civil War. It covered the same
period as <a href="solohov.htm">Sholokhov</a>'s <i>Quiet Flows the Don</i>
(1928-40), but from the viewpoint of the progressive intelligentsia. </p>
      <p><em>Peter the First</em> (1929-45, book 1-2) was hailed as the
best Soviet historical novel ever written &#8211; also in West perhaps due to
its apolitical views. Moreover, the historical novel made a strong
comeback in the 1930s and&nbsp;contributed to the rise of historical
films.&nbsp; Tolstoi never managed to finish the third part of the book
before his death.&nbsp;He&nbsp;followed the myth of Peter the Great as
a progressive ruler who made Russia strong, while also having a heart
for the people. Tolstoi did not try to interpret history in a new way
but used traditional material. Among his sources were works by the
novelist Dmitry Merezhkovasky (1865-1941) and Daniil Mordovtsev, and
the historians Vasily Klyuchevsky and Vladimir Solovyov (1853-1900).
Tolstoi's screenplay for the lavishly produced film version from
1937-38, directed by Vladimir Petrov, justified Peter's interest in
imperial expansion. </p>
      <p>Tolstoi's&nbsp;historical drama <i>Na dybe</i> (1929) was
about the czar, too, but Peter was characterized as a tyrant. Stalin
attended a preview of the play, regretting that "Peter was not drawn
heroically enough."&nbsp; Owing to changes in the regime's policies,
its second version, <i>Pyotr Pervy</i> (1938) presented the tsar in a
more sympathetic light. After Stalin wanted to see himself as a
modern-day Peter, the czar become a builder-ruler in the history
writing.&nbsp; In 1937&nbsp;Tolstoi said to his friend, the painter
Yurii Annenkov: "I rewrote it again, in conformity with the revelations
of the Party, and now I'm writing a third and hopefully final version
of the thing, since the second version also didn't satisfy our Joseph."
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When a man's at war and constantly
facing death he rises above his ordinary self. All the trashy stuff
that doesn't matter peels off him, like dead skin after sunburn, and
only the kernel, the real man, is left."</b> (in 'The Russian
Character', 1944) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Tolstoi's political novels&nbsp;include <i>Chornoe zoloto</i>
(1932), which painted uncharitable caricatures of Russian émigrés, and <i>Khleb
      </i>(1937), in which history was&nbsp;crudely falsified to
denigrate <a href="trotsky.htm">Trotsky</a>. In his last plays, <i>Oryol
i orlitsa</i> (1942,. The Eagle and Its Mate) and <i>Trudnye gody</i>
(1943, The Difficult Years) Tolstoi idealized Ivan the Terrible and
then drew parallels between him and Stalin &#8211; an idea that the film
director Sergei Eisenstein developed in his monumental film production,
      <i>Ivan the Terrible</i> (1945-46). Stalin disliked especially
the second part,&nbsp;in which Ivan Groznyi was portrayed as a
disturbed Hamlet-like figure, but the first part won a Stalin Prize.
Trying to save his film, Eisenstein acknowledged the errors and asked
in a letter to Stalin permission to revise the work. </p>
      <p>In Tolstoi's <i>Ivan the Terrible</i> the czar was a
democratic ruler, who worked for the good of Russia tirelessly and
mercilessly. The first part dealt with his love for his Kirghiz wife, <i>The
Difficult Years </i>focused on Ivan's activities as a statesman.
The&nbsp;work,&nbsp;which won&nbsp;Tolstoi a third, posthumous Stalin
Prize in 1946,&nbsp;had been commissioned as a result of instructions
of the Communist Party concerning "the need for the restoration of a
true historica image of Ivan IV in Russian history." </p>
      <p>Tolstoi also published two science fiction novels, both of
which appeared in the experimental 1920s and which were revised during
the following decades of Stalinist terror. <i>Aelita </i>(1923), a
science-fiction fantasy in the manner of H.G. Wells, told the story of
a Soviet expedition to Mars with the aim of establishing communism. The
native Martians are in fact long-ago emigrants from Atlantis. The story
was adapted into screen in 1924. <i>Aelita</i>'s film version
preceeded Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis </i>by three years. Its
futuristic, Expressionistic sets were designed by Isaac Rabinovitch of
the Kamerny Theatre. Jakov Protazanov, the director, had worked in
Paris and Berlin before he returned to the Soviet Union. The film is
said to have influenced the design&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<i>Flash Gordon </i>space
opera, which was created by the artist Alex Raymond in 1934 and led to
a popular radio serial and several films. </p>
      <p>Tolstoi's <i>Giperboloid inzhenera Garina</i> (1926, The
Death Box) described an attempt of an unscrupulous inventor to use his
death ray to conquer the world. He manages to rule a decadently
capitalist USA for a short period. <i>Bunt mashin</i> (1924) was a
play, based on Carel Capek's science fiction story <i>R.U.R.</i> With
the journalist Alexander Starchakov, who died in one of Stalin's
purges, Tolstoi wrote the libretto for Dmitri Shostakovich's satirical
opera <i>Orango</i> (1932). The opera in three acts, which was
rediscovered in 2006, portrays a "biomorph", half-man and half-monkey. </p>
