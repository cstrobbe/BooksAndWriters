<P><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->A major American poet, who worked first 
as an Unitarian priest. In his hometown, Concord, Emerson founded a literary circle called New England Transcendentalism, a hodgepodge of fashionable thoughts, in which participated among others <A href="hawthorn.htm">Nathaniel Hawthorne</A> and <A href="thoreau.htm">Henry Thoreau</A>. During his travels in England he met <A href="wordswor.htm">Wordsworth</A>, <A href="coleridg.htm">Coleridge</A>, and <A href="carlyle.htm">Thomas Carlyle</A>, with whom he maintained a lifelong correspondence from the 1830s and whose opinions of the importance of great historical figures influenced his own writings. 
Later Emerson became involved in the antislavery movement and worked for women's rights. </P>

<P>Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Most of his ancestors were clergymen as his father, who died when Emerson was eight. He was educated in Boston and Harvard, like his father, and graduated in 1821. While at Harvad, he began keeping a journal, which became a source of his later lectures, essays, and books. In 1825 he began to study at the Harvard Divinity School and next year he was licensed to preach by the Middlesex Association of Ministers. In 1829 Emerson married the seventeen-year-old Ellen Louisa Tucker, who died in 1831 from tuberculosis. She had been young and pretty, and in March 1832, Emerson opened her coffin, a year and two months after her burial, just to see her. In his own journal he wrote: "I visited Ellen's tomb and opened the coffin." </P><P>Emerson's first and only settlement was at the important Second Unitarian Church of Boston, where he became sole pastor in 1830. Three years later he had a crisis of faith, finding that he "was not interested" in the rite of Communion. Her once remarked, that if his teachers had been aware of his true thoughts, they would not have allowed him to become a minister. Eventually Emerson's controversial views caused his resignation. However, he never ceased to be both teacher and preacher, although without the support of any concrete idea of God. </P>
<P>In 1832 Emerson sold his household furniture and traveled to Europe. While in England&nbsp;met William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Thomas Carlyle, whith whom he corresponded for half a century. During his Italian journey Emerson read Goethe's account of his trip, <EM>Italian Journey</EM>, and following Goethe's footsteps, he took in Italy's tourist attactions. In his journal he wrote: "Goethe says "he shall never again be wholly unhappy, for he has seen Naples." If he has said "happy," there would have been equal reason. You cannot go five yards in any direction without seeing saddest objects &amp; hearing the most piteous wailings. Instead of the gayest of cities, you seem to walk in the wards of a hospital." </P><P>In 1835 Emerson married Lydia Jackson, who came from an old Plymouth&nbsp;family that went back to John Cotton. He&nbsp;settled with her at the east end of the village of Concord, Massachusetts, where he then spent the rest of his life. Lydia had a strong, brooding face, she was interested in poetry,&nbsp;and loved cats. Her mother and father had died when she was sixteen. Emerson's oldest son, Waldo, died at the age of five.</P><P>Emerson went on a lecture tour in Europe in 1848. A letter to a London newspaper requested lowering the admission price so that the poorer people could attend, for "to miss him is to lose an important part of the Nineteenth Century." The English writer Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909) did not share the admiration which his countrymen had for Emerson&nbsp;– he called Emerson "a wrinkled baboon, a man first hoisted into notoriety on the shoulders of Carlyle, and who now spits and sputters on a filthier platform of his own finding and fouling."&nbsp;Upon his return&nbsp;to the United States, Emerson lectured on natural history, biology, and history. </P><P>Like Wordsworth,&nbsp;Emerson drew inspiration from Nature. His first book,&nbsp;<EM>Nature,</EM> a collection of essays,&nbsp;came out&nbsp; when he was 33 and summoned up his ideas. Emerson emphasized individualism and rejected traditional authority. He invited to "enjoy an original relation to the universe," and emphasized "the infinitude of the private man." All creation is one, he believed&nbsp;– people should try to live a simple life in harmony with nature and with others. "... the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God," he wrote in <EM>Nature</EM>, the manifesto of American transcendentalism. His lectures 'The American Scholar' (1837),&nbsp;and 'Address at Divinity College' (1838) challenged the Harvard intelligentsia and warned about the formalism of the clergy of his time. He was ostracized by Harvad for many years, but his message attracted young disciples, who joined the informal Transcendental Club, organized in 1836 by the Unitarian clergyman F.H. Hedge. </P>

<P>In 1840 Emerson helped Margaret Fuller to launch<I> The Dial</I> (1840-44), an open forum for new ideas on the reformation of society. From&nbsp;his compensated lectures Emerson produced his various books and collections of essays.&nbsp;A selection of his earlier lectures and writings appeared in 1841 under the title <EM>Essays</EM>. It was followed by&nbsp;<EM>Essays: Second Series</EM>&nbsp;(1844), a collection of lectures annexed to a reprint of&nbsp;<EM>Nature</EM>&nbsp;(1849), and&nbsp;<EM>Representative Men</EM>&nbsp;(1850). In these works Emerson encouraged his readers to trust instinct, use their potential talents for authentic self-discovery as the great men have done, and perceive Nature as a source of inspiration and great truths. Many of his best poems Emerson write in 1834, a collection came out in 1840. When&nbsp;Emerson was courting Lydia, he said, "I am born a poet, of a low class without doubt yet a poet. This is my nature and vocation." </P><P>Emerson started to gain success as a lecturer in the 1850s and his books became a source of moderate income. His <EM>English Traits</EM>, a summary of English character and history, appeared in 1856. Other later works include <EM>Conduct of Life</EM>&nbsp;(1860),&nbsp;<EM>Society and Solitude</EM>&nbsp; (1870), a selection of poems called&nbsp;<EM>Parnassus</EM>&nbsp;(1874), and <EM>Letters and Social Aims</EM>, edited by J.Elliot Cabot (1876). Emerson's heath started fail after the partial burning of his house in 1872. He made his last tour abroad in 1872-1873, and then withdrew more and more from public life. Emerson died on April 27, 1882, in Concord. In the 1880s appeared posthumously &nbsp;<EM>Miscellanies</EM>&nbsp;(1884), a collection of political speeches, and <EM>Lectures and Biographical Sketches </EM>(1884). </P>
<P>As an essayist Emerson was a master of style. "Emerson is God," declared the literary theorist Harold Bloom once, and testified with this the importance of Emerson to American literature. Many of his phrases have long since passed into common English parlance: 'a minority of one', 'the devil's attorney', 'a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds'. His essays have speech like character and a prophetic tone, a sermon like quality, often linked to his practice as an Unitarian minister. Emerson's aim was not merely to charm his readers, but encourage them to cultivate 'self-trust' and to be open to the intuitive world of experience. Philosophy for Emerson was always entwined with the concrete reality of life. </P><P>In his essay 'Books' Emerson advised to avoid mediocrities: <FONT size=2><FONT size=3>"Be sure, then to read no mean books. Shun the spawn of the press of the gossip of the hour. Do not read what you shall learn, without asking, in the street and the train. Dr. Johnson said, "he always went into stately shops" and good travellers stop at the best hotels; for, though they cost more, they do not cost much more, and there is the good company and the best information. In like manner, the scholar knows that the famed books contain, first and last, the vest thoughts and facts. Now and then, by rarest luck, in some foolish Grub Street in the gem we want. But in the best circles is the best information. If you should transfer the amount of your reading day by day from the newspapers to the standard authors&nbsp;&nbsp;–&nbsp; But who dare speak such a thing."</FONT><STRONG> </STRONG></FONT>Emerson encouraged American scholars to break free of European influences and create a new American culture. He had formulated this idea&nbsp;in his&nbsp;a Phi Beta Kappa address, 'The American Scholar,' which Oliver Wendell Holmes (Sr.) hailed as nothing less than the declaration of of independence of American letters. Emerson believed that the development of culture was a more worthy end of a government than the development of commerce.<FONT size=2></FONT></P>
