<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American poet and painter who first attracted
attention for his eccentric punctuation, but the commonly held belief that
E.E. Cummings had his name legally changed to lowercase letters is erroneous &#150; preferred to capitalize the initials of his name on book covers and in other material.
Despite typographical eccentricity and devotion to the avant-garde, 
Cummings's themes are in many respects quite traditional. He often 
dealt with the antagonism between an individual and the masses, but 
his style brought into his poems lightness and satirical tones. 
As an artist Cummings painted still-life pictures and landscapes 
at a professional level. </P>

<P>Edward Estlin Cummings was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was a Harvard
teacher and later a Unitarian minister. Cummings was educated at Cambridge
High and Latin School, and from 1911 to 1916 he attended Harvard, 
where

he met John Dos Passos. Cummings became an aesthete, he began 
dress unconventionally, and dedicated himself to painting and literature. He graduated in 1915 with a major in classics. </P>


<P>With Dos Passos and others he published in 1917 <I>Eight Harvard 
Poets</I>. During the last years of World War I, he drove an ambulance 
in France. Indiscreet comments in the letters of a friend led  to 
Cummings's arrest and incarceration in a French concentration camp 
at La Fert&#233;-Mac&#233;. Later, he found out he had been accused 
of treason, but the charges were never proven. This experience 
gave basis for Cummings's only novel, <I>The Enormous Room</I> 
(1922), in which he drew acidly funny sketches of the jailers 
and sympathetic portraits of prisoners. It was followed by 
collections of verse, <I>Tulips and Chimneys</I> (1923), 
which contrasted the evils of war to the 'sweet spontaneous 
earth', and <I>XLI Poems</I> (1925). In the 1920s and1930s Cummings divided his time between Paris, where he studied art, and New York, where he had a child with a friend's wife. </P>
<P>In Paris Cummings met the poets Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, and 
Archibald MacLeish. His friends also included the philosopher 
A.J. Ayer, who had a short affair with Cummings' wife, Marion 
Morehouse. She was twelve years his junior, a former Ziegfield 
showgirl and one of the leading models of the age. Cummings's 
friendship with Ayer lasted over twenty-five years. Once 
Cummings took Ayer to see the legendary stripper Gypsy Rose 
Lee. &quot;You walk on tightropes as if they lay on the ground,&quot; 
Cummings wrote in a birthday poem to Ayer, &quot;and always, bird 
eyed, notice more than we notice you notice.&quot; </P>
<P>Cummings supported himself by  painting portraits and 
writing for <I>Vanity Fair</I>. Throughout the 1920s, he 
contributed to <I>The Dial</I>, perhaps America's 
greatest literary journal. <I>&</I> (1925) and
<I>is 5</I> (1925), inspired by Apollinaire, were 
written in the poet's new style.  The books presented 
his radical experiments with punctuation and typography, 
and he used lower letter cases in his own name. In 1930 
he Cummings published a sixty-three page volume with no 
title. Grammatical anarchism, a modern extension of 
romanticism, was a both result of the poet's hostility 
to mass society and his attempt to find a new way to  
write on old subjects:   &quot;Since feeling is first 
/ who pays any attention / to the syntax of things / 
will never wholly kiss you.&quot; <FONT SIZE="2"> 
(from 'since feling is first', 1926). </FONT> In 
the line &quot;mOOn Over tOwns mOOn&quot; (1935), 
which showed the movement of the full moon, the 
letters became pictorial signs. </P>
<P>Cummings believed that modern mass society was a threat to 
individuals. &quot;Progress is a comfortable disease,&quot; 
Cummings once wrote. He was interested in jazz, 
which had not yet become mass entertainment, cubism, 
and contemporary slang, an unorthodox form of language. 
In his poems Cummings often expressed his rebellious attitude 
towards religion, politics, and conformity.<B> </B>&quot;the 
Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls / are unbeautiful 
and have comfortable minds / (also,with the church's protestant 
blessings / daughters,unscented shapeless spirited) they 
believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead&quot;.<FONT SIZE="2"> 
(from 'the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls', 1923). 
</FONT>  But Cummings also celebrated the joy of life and the 
beauty of natural world, from which people have unluckily 
estranged themselves.<B> </B>&quot;anyone lived in a 
pretty how town / (with up so floating many bells down) 
spring summer autumn winter / he sang his didn't he danced 
his did.&quot; <FONT SIZE="2">(from 'anyone lived in a 
pretty how town', 1940). </FONT></P>

<P>In 1927 his play<I> him</I> was produced by the 
Provincetown Players in New York City. During these 
years he exhibited his paintings and drawings, but 
they failed to attract as much critical interest as 
his writings. Moreover, his ballet <I>Tom</I>, 
based on <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I>, was pronounced 
undanceable, and fourteen publishers had politely 
turned down his new book, entitled <I>70 Poems</I>. 
In 1931 Cummings traveled in the Soviet Union and 
recorded  later his impressions in <I>Eimi</I>  
(1933), a version of Dante's <I>Descent into Hell</I>, 
in which he saw the Russians as &quot;undead.&quot; 
However, on leaving Russia he also translated 
Louis Aragon's <I>Le Front Rouge</I>, a poem 
influenced by Mayakovsky. </P>
<P>When Cummings did not find  a publisher for <I>70 Poems</I>, 
he got $300 from his mother and published the collection 
in 1935 under his own imprint, the Golden Eagle Press, 
but now entitleD <I>No Thanks</I>.

<P>From 1952 to 1953 Cummings was a professor at Harvard. His series of 
lectures appeared under the title <I>i: six nonlectures</I>. 
In 1957 he received
a special citation from the National Book Award Committee for 
<I>Poems, 1923-1954</I>, and in 1957 he won the Bollinger Prize. 
Cummings was married three times, first to Elaine Orr; the marriage 
ended in divorce in less than nine months. He then married Anne 
Minnerly Barton; they separated in 1932. The rest of his 
life Cummings shared with Marion Morehouse, a photographer 
and model, whom he met in 1933. They collaborated in 1962 
in Marion Morehouse's photographic book, <I>Adventures in 
Value</I>. Cummings  died of cerebral hemorrhage on September 
3, 1962, in North Conway. </P>
