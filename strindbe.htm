<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Swedish playwright, novelist, and
short-story
writer, who combined in his works psychology, naturalism, and later
elements of new literary forms. Strindberg was married three times &#8211;
several of his plays drew on the problems of his marriages and
reflected his constant interest in self-analysis. A sensitive and
controversial writer, who suffered from hostile reviews, Strindberg
represented the 19th-century ideal of artist as a free personality,
unrestrained by convention.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"My souls (characters) are
conglomerations of past and present stages of civilization, bits from
books and newspapers, scraps of humanity, rags and tatters of fine
clothing, patched together as is the human soul. And I have added a
little evolutionary history by making the weaker steal and repeat the
words of the stronger, and by making the characters borrow ideas or
"suggestions" from one another." </b>(author's foreword to Miss Julie,
in </font><i><font size="2">Six Plays of Strindberg</font></i><font size="2">, 1955) </font></blockquote>
      <p>August Strindberg was born in Stockholm. His father, Carl
Oscar
Strindberg, proud of a trace of aristocratic blood, was a shipping
agent, but his business success was relatively modest. Strindberg's
mother, Ulrika Eleanora Norling, had a proletarian background. She was
a tailor's daughter, who had been a domestic servant and become Carl
Oscar's mistress. August was their third son; the couple had nine more
children. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ulrika Eleanora died when Strindberg was 13
years old. After his father remarried, Strindberg came to hate his
stepmother. To underline his sympathies with the lower-classes,
Strindberg entitled his autobiography <i>The Son of a Servant</i>
(1886). Strindberg's childhood was poor and miserable &#8211; he was shy
and family tensions depressed him. <a href="heidenst.htm">Verner von Heidenstam</a>
once said that he never heard him laugh. His habitual expression was so
severe, he described, that if you met him on a mountain path you would
hand him your purse before he asked for it. </p>
      <p>In 1867 Strindberg entered the University of Uppsala, where he
failed to pass the preliminary examination in chemistry. He was
employed for
a short time by the Royal Dramatic Theatre, writing for the stage
three plays that were rejected. Strindberg returned to his studies in
Uppsala and completed in 1872 a senior candidacy. Back in Stockholm,
Strindberg worked as a journalist and finished the historical drama<em>
Mäster Olof</em>,
about the introspective Swedish Protestant reformer Olaus Petri. It was
written in the spirit of Shakespeare but Strindberg also adopted
influences from Schiller. </p>
      <p>Strindberg became in 1874 an assistant librarian at the Royal
Library, serving until his resignation in 1882. He married in 1877
Baroness Siri von Essen, who had been wife of Baron Carl Gustaf
Wrangel, and was a member of the Swedish aristocracy in Finland. By the
time of the marriage Siri was seven months pregnant; the child died and
they had later three more children, one of whom, Kristin, wrote an
account of her parents' stormy life together. In&nbsp;<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>En dåres försvarstal</em>&nbsp;</span></span>
(1887, A Madman's Defense) Strindberg returned to his first marriage in
a story in which the narrator is torn between adoration and revulsion.
However, first the marriage brought some balance into Strindberg's
life. </p>
      <p>Strinberg´s first published novel, <em>Röda rummet </em>(1879,
The
Red Room), a satirical story about early capitalism and corruption in
Stockholm, made him nationally famous. Arvid Falk, the central
character, is an aspiring writer who loses all his illusions, and
finally accepts bourgeois family life. With this book Strindberg
started his career as one of the most prominent figures in Nordic
literature and culture. <i>Master Olof,</i> which first had been
rejected, was produced in 1881 and received with enthusiasm. </p>
      <p><em>Svenska folket</em> (1880-82) was an excursion into the
history
of Sweden. Far from trying to establish himself as Sweden's national
writer, Strindberg attacked the nation's central values, official
history writing, and made himself unpopular among academic historians.
Strindberg's revenge on his critics was <em>Det nya riket</em> (1882),
a dissection of Oscarian Sweden. In Denmark he was accused of
antisemitism. </p>
      <p>To escape the uproar which he had stirred up, and partly to
follow
the example of many other Scandinavian writers, Strinberg decided to
travel abroad. He first moved in 1883 to France with his family and
between the years 1884 and 1887 he lived with short interruptions in
Switzerland. During this time he corresponded with <a href="../../../nietzsch.htm">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and became
interested of the works of <a href="../../../eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a>.
Under financial and marital difficulties, Strindberg started to show
symptoms of emotional crisis. Feelings of persecution were suppressed
by heavy drinking of absinthe. Eventually he started to believe his
wife wanted to have him locked away in a mental institution.</p>
      <p>While staying with his wife Siri in Grez-sur-Loing, on the
edge of the Forest of
Fontainebleau,&nbsp; Strindberg met there <a href="bjornson.htm">Bjørnstjerne
Bjørnson</a>. Other members of the Scandinvian artists' colony
included Carl Larson, Jonas Lie, Karl Nordström, Ville Vallgren, and
Anders Zorn. </p>
      <p>The publication of the first part of his scenes of marital life<em>&nbsp;Giftas</em>
(1884, Getting Married), outraged the Swedish establishment, especially
the short story 'Reward of virtue', in which Strindberg mocked the Holy
Communion. The book was confiscated, Strindberg was prosecuted for
blasphemy but acquitted. In Sweden the younger generation hailed him as
a hero. <i>Getting Married </i>was inspired by Ibsen's play<i> A
Doll's House</i>
(1883), but Strindberg was more on the side of Nora's husband. However,
Strindberg's egalitarian vision of gender roles was radical for its day
and age, although at the same time he accepted the idea that celibacy
could lead to physical debility.</p>
Strindberg's friendship with Bjørnson eventually grew very sour.
Bjørnson
first adviced him to go into exile ("This prosecution is the biggest
and best advertisement for the book," he wrote) and then urged him to
return to Sweden and face the charges. Strindberg's letter crushed
Bjørnson's hopes that his younger colleague would be his ally: "Your
Majesty. I am in receipt of your
Imperial decree and will have the honour of completely ignoring it! . .
. "I don't want any immoral advice about returning home and making a
spectacle of myself in order to advertise my writings, which need no
such assistance! Your former friend, August Strindberg."
      <p> </p>
      <p><em>Fröken Julie</em>&nbsp;(1888, Miss Julie), Stridberg's
next major drama after&nbsp;<em>Fadren</em>
(1887, The Father), coupled one of his favorite themes, the Darwinian
battle between the sexes, with a social struggle and love-hate bond.
Strindberg wrote it durring his stay in Denmark. The protagonist,
Julie, a daughter of a count, allows herself to be seduced by her
father's servant Jean. She must then confront the situation, in which
Jean, a man on the rise, turns out to be the stronger person. Julie
causes her own tragic fate. Unable to arrive at any reasonable plan,
she orders Jean to hypnotize her into committing suicide.<i> Miss Julie
      </i>had its premiere at Strindberg's Experimental Theater in
Copenhagen in 1889. <br>
</p>
      <p>Alf Sjöberg's film adaptation of the play from 1951 was
faithful to Strindberg's dislike of fragmentation into the acts. He had
already staged Strindberg's play and had experimented with
"simultaneous theatre," where the stage was shared by the actors and
their visions, or with ghosts. The cinematographer Göran Strindberg was
the author's grandson. From 1954-61 he worked mostly in West Germany
photographing 11 films, notably Kurt Siodmak's <span style="font-style: italic;">Die Ratten</span> (1955), Horst Hächler's <span style="font-style: italic;">Liebe</span> (1956), based on <a href="vbaum.htm">Vicki Baum</a>'s novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Danger from Deer</span>, and Gottfried Reinhardt's <span style="font-style: italic;">Menschen im Hotel</span> (1959), also from a novel by Baum. <br>
 </p>

      <blockquote><b><font size="2">"The Thèâtre Libre did not start
its
activity by proclaiming any program; it has never developed an
aesthetic, never wanted to for a school... All prohibitive laws have
been canceled, and only the demands of taste and of the modern spirit
are allowed to determine the artistic form."</font></b> <font size="2">(from
'On Modern Drama and Modern Theatre', 1889, in </font><i><font size="2">Samlade
Skrifter</font></i><font size="2">, XVII, 1913) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After completing Miss Julie, Strindberg wrote in 1889 with
Antoine's Théâtre Libre a group of one act plays, <em>Paria</em>, <em>Den
starkare</em>, and <em>Samum</em>,
and returned to Sweden. He divorced from Siri von Essen and moved to
Berlin, where he met an Austrian journalist Maria Uhl, known as Frida
Uhl, his second wife, whom he married in 1893. Their honeymoon the
couple spent in London, but after disagreements Strindberg escaped to
the island of Rügen. The marriage became the subject of his
autobiographical sketch, <em>Klostret </em>(1966, The Cloister), but
he also dealt with marital problems in some minor works, as in the
short story 'An Attenmpt at Reform'. In the ironic picture of "a model
marriage" a young couple try to live together but maintain at the same
their independence. They have separate rooms, share expenses and
household work equally, and throw away the double bed, "that
abomination which has no counterpart in nature and is responsible for a
great deal of dissipation and immorality." After the birth of their
baby, the husband asks himself: "Didn't she do her full share of of the
work by mothering the baby? Wasn't that as good as money?" And the wife
soon gets over the fact that he had to keep her. </p>
      <p>Haunted by guilt about deserting his children and attacked by
his
critics, Strindberg became possessed of a persecution mania. He also
suffered from insomnia and psoriasis, and spent some weeks in the St.
Louis Hospital in Paris. Between the years 1892 and 1897 Strindberg
experienced several psychotic episodes, and recorded his tormented
thoughts later in <i>Inferno</i>. Turning to painting, Strindberg
created in the 1890s seascapes, which have been compared to the works
of Turner. His favorite motifs included a vision from a cave toward the
outside world and a wave breaking in open sea. With the help of
Swedenborgian studies, and adopting the idea that certain people are
destined to suffer, he emerged from the crisis. </p>
      <p>While
spending the summer of 1892 on Dalarö, he produced about
thirty paintings. His first exhibition Strindberg held in the same
year. It was not a success; only two canvases were bought. Alone in
Paris in the mid-1890s, Strindberg became interested in alchemy and
tried to prove that it is possible to make gold. He was permitted to
work in the laboratory of the Sorbonne, and his paper on the nature of
sulphur was reported in <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Petit Temps</span> (January 30, 1895).
For a time he was respected by the scientific community. He was also
interested in monkeys, developing a theory that the gorilla was
descended from a shipwrecked sailor and an ordinary female monkey. <br>
</p>
      <p>For his neighbor, Paul
Gauguin, Strindberg wrote a an insightful letter which the artist uses as a
preface to his catalogue. "I cannot grasp your art and I cannot like
it," Strindberg said. "But I know that this confession will neither
surprise nor injure you, for you seem to me to be thoroughly fortified
by the hatred of others; in its desire to be left alone, your character
takes pleasure in the antipathy that it provokes." After stopping
painting in 1905, Strindberg built with the photographer Herman
Andersson the "Wunderkamera", with which he made photographic portraits.</p>

      <p>In the novel <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>I
havsbandet</em> </span></span>(1890,
By the Open Sea) Strindberg expressed his fascination with the sea and
Swedish archipelago, which he had depicted in&nbsp;<em>Hemsöborna</em>
(1887, The Natives of Hemsö), a return to his favorite place of his
youth, the island of Kymmendö, where he had began to write <i>Mäster
Olaf</i>.
"A dark cliff came into view on the headland of the last island. It was
coal-black, made of the volcanic rock diorite, and as he drew near it
he became depressed. The black chrystallised mass seemed to have been
spewed up from the bottom of the sea and then, as it had begun to
petrify, had been involved in a fearful struggle with the water or some
thunder-cloud."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">By the Open Sea</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>
      <p>Strindberg moved to Stockholm and wrote during the following
productive years from 1898 to 1909 thirty-six plays. In the Damascus
trilogy 1898-1901, <em>Påsk</em> (1901, Easter), <em>and Ett drömspel
      </em>(1901,
A Dream Play) Strindberg made use of details of his second marriage.
The protagonist of the trilogy is called the 'Stranger' or 'The Unknown
One', a man on a journey to discover his fate. He has left his wife and
children and goes through a series of trials. <em>Påsk</em> dealt with
the theme of death and resurrection. The play tells a story of a woman,
who lives with her children in fear of the coming of the creditor, who,
in fact, brings reconciliation and the remission of debt. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In old Greek the word </b></font><b><i><font size="2">drama</font></i><font size="2">
seems to have meant event, not action or what we call conscious
intrigue. For life does not move as regularly as a constructed drama,
and conscious spinners of intrigue very seldom get a chance to carry
out their plans in detail. Thus we no longer believe in these cunning
plotters who, unhindered, are permitted to control people's destinies,
so that the villain in his conscious falseness merely arouses our
ridicule as not being true to life."</font></b><font size="2"> (from
'On Modern Drama and Modern Theatre', 1889, in </font><i><font size="2">Samlade
Skrifter</font></i><font size="2">, XVII, 1913) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In <i>A Dream Play</i> Strindberg attempted to imitate the
logical
form of a dream. Time and space are not important in the dramaturgy,
the characters split, all thoughts and perceptions emanate from a
single individual's unconscious, the dreamer's. Behind the character of
the luminous protagonist, Daughter of Indra, who descends to earth, was
the young actress Harriet Bosse, who became the author's third wife.
The emphasis on subjectivity in the play foreshadowed <a href="../../../freud.htm">Freud</a>'s theories about the gap between
the conscious and unconscious. </p>
      <p>Strindberg's series of historical plays from this period
included <em>Gustav Vasa</em> (1899), <em>Erik XIV</em> (1899), a
portrait of a man who was half-genius, half-psychopath, and <em>Gustaf
Adolf</em> (1900), said to be unplayable, in which the king is an
instument of the ideal of religious freedom. In the novel <em>Svarta
fanor</em>&nbsp;(1904,
Black Banners) Strindberg took his revenge after decades of negative
critic and condemned with a Biblical fury his colleagues, wrong
prophets, and parasites of culture. Strindberg continied his religious
and natural philosophical speculations in <i>Zones of the Spirit </i>(1907-1912)
and its sequels. <em>Götiska rummen</em>&nbsp;(1904) was written as a
companion piece to<i> Röda rummet</i> from 1879, but Strindberg's
youthful vigour had gone, and had been replaced by bitterness and
misantrophy. </p>
      <p>During 1907-08 Strindberg undertook a series of experiments in
order
to establish an intimate theater, based on his innovations on the form
of chamber music. He discharged the single protagonist in favor of a
small group of equally important characters, creating a drama that
would impress by its mood and atmosphere. In contrast to the ill and
corrupt characters who people the dramas, Strindberg created an
individual, who is capable of perceiving supernatural phenomena, and of
stripping away the facades of lies and deceits. Among Strindberg's
works from 1907 were such chamber plays as&nbsp;<em>Oväder</em> (1906,
The Thunderstorm),<em> Brända tomten</em> (1907, After the Fire), in
which everything is worse that the protagonist expects, <em>Spöksonaten
      </em>(1907, The Ghost Sonata), an unmasking of a middle-class
pretensions, and&nbsp;<em>Pelikanen</em>&nbsp;(1908,
The Pelican), in which the final purgation happens through fire.
Strindberg called his plays "kammerspiel" after Max Reinhardt's
"Kammerspiel-Haus" in Berlin. <em>Stora landsvägen </em>(1909, The
Great Highway) was Strindberg's final allegorical self-portrayal. Ofter
characterized as the author's literary testament, Strindberg himself
appeared in the figure of the hunter who climbs down from the mountain
&#8211; like Zarathustra. </p>
      <p>In 1908 Strindberg settled into a house he called "the Blue
Tower"
and lived there until his death from stomach cancer on May 14, 1912.
According to his wish, Strindberg was buried beneath wooden crucifixes
with the inscription O Crux Ave Spes Unica. Faithful to his role as an
iconoclast and a disturber, Strindberg fuelled the so-called Strindberg
Feud from 1910 to his death with a series of newspaper articles on
social, literary, and political issues. His major adversary was
Heidenstam,
whom he called "Sweden's most unintelligent man." Strindberg described
Heidenstam's friend, the critic and author&nbsp;Oscar Levertin&nbsp;as
his "greatest enemy" in his <em>Occult Diary</em>.&nbsp;On the day
when Levertin died, he&nbsp;noted that&nbsp;something that had been
oppressing him had gone&nbsp;and he&nbsp;fell into a holiday mood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Like Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), Strindberg never
received the Nobel Prize for literature. However, he had actively
supported the Trades Union movement and was awarded its alternative
Nobel Prize. Strindberg wrote more than 70 plays as well as novels,
short-stories and studies of Swedish history. His influnce has been
wide. As a dramatist he was a source of inspiration to the German
expressionists, and to Eugene O'Neill, Eugène Ionesco, and Tennessee
Williams, and his impact is seen among others in the works of such
playwrights as <a href="../../../hpinter.htm">Harold Pinter</a>, <a href="../../../beckett.htm">Samuel Beckett</a>, John Osborne, and John
Arden. Pär Lagerkvist wrote about Strindberg in <i>Modern Theatre</i>
(1966): "And it is a fact that he has meant the renewal of the modern
drama, and thereby also the gradual renewal of the theatre. It is from
him and through him that naturalism received the critical blow, even
though it is also Strindberg who gave naturalism its most intense
dramatic works."</p>
