<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Argentine poet, essayist, and
short-story
writer, whose tales of fantasy and dreamworlds are classics of the
20th-century world literature. Borges was profoundly influenced by
European culture, English literature, and such thinkers as Berkeley,
who argued that there is no material substance; the sensible world
consists only of ideas, which exists for so long as they are perceived.
Most of Borges's tales embrace universal themes&nbsp;&#8211; the often
recurring circular labyrinth can be seen as a metaphor of life or a
riddle which theme is time. Although Borges's name was mentioned in
speculations about
Nobel Prize, Borges never became a Nobel Laureate.</p>

      <p>Jorge Luis Borges was born in Buenos Aires. His family
included British ancestry and he learned English before Spanish. Jorge
Guillermo Borges, his father, was a lawyer and a psychology teacher,
who demonstrated the paradoxes of Zeno on a chessboard for his son. In
the large house was also a library and garden which enchanted Borges's
imagination. Borges's mother, Leonor Acevedo Haedo, was a translator;
she lived far into her 90's. In 1914 the family moved to Geneva, where
Borges learned French and German and received his B.A. from the Collège
of Geneva. According to a story, Borges's father, worried about his
son's sexual initation, sent him to a prostitute in the red-light
district area, the Place Dubourg de Four. There Borges started to think
that his father was her "client". Borges's visit failed miserably and
perhaps contributed to his lifelong difficulties with women. </p>
      <b>
      </b>
      <p>After World War I the Borges family lived in Spain, where he
was a member of avant-garde Ultraist literary group. His first poem,
'Hymn to the Sea,' written in the style of Walt Whitman, was published
in the magazine <i>Grecia</i>. In 1921 Borges settled in Buenos Aires.
There he started his career as a writer by publishing poems and essays
in literary journals. Among his friends was the philosopher Macedonio
Fernandez, whose dedication linguistic problems influenced his thought.
Borges's first collection of poetry was <span style="font-style: italic;">Fervor de Buenos Aires</span> (1923). He
contributed to the avant-garde review <i>Martin Fierro</i>, and
co-founded the journal <i>Proa</i> (1924-26). For decades Borges was
the chief contributor of <i>Sur</i>, Argentina's most important
literary journal, which was founded in 1931 by Victoria Ocampo. He also
served as literary adviser for the publishing house Emecé Editores,
worked as a literary editor of the <i>Saturday Color Magazine</i> of
the tabloid newspaper <i>Crítica,</i> and wrote weekly columns for <i>El
Hogar</i> from 1936 to 1939. As a critic Borges gained fame with
interpretations of the Argentine classics. His writings displayed a
deep knowledge of European and American literature, in particular for
such writers as Poe, Stevenson, Kipling, Shaw, Chesterton, Whitman,
Emerson, and Twain. He also translated Virginia Woolf's <i>Orlando</i>,
Henri Michaux's <i>A Barbarian in Asia</i>, Herman Melville's <i>Bartleby
the Scrivener</i>, and William Faulkner's <i>The Wild Palms</i>. </p>
      <p>Borges's father died in 1938, a great blow because the two had
been unusually close. Borges also suffered a severe head wound. He
developed a blood poisoning and nearly died. The experience freed in
him deep forces of creativity, and at the hospital, where he spent
several weeks, he wrote several of his most important stories. His
first collection, <span style="font-style: italic;">El jardín de
senderos que se bifurcan </span>(1941) was nominated for the National
Literary Prize, but a lesser book was awarded, in spite of a special
issue by <i>Sur</i>, in which a number of his friends and
acquaintances expressed their support. Later collections include <span style="font-style: italic;">Ficciones</span> (1944), <span style="font-style: italic;">El Aleph</span> (1949), and <span style="font-style: italic;">El hacedor</span> (1960). Borges's
interest in fantasy was shared by another well-known Argentine writer
of fiction, Adolfo Bioy Casares, with whom Borges coauthored under the
pseudonym H. Bustos Domecq several collections of tales.</p>
      <p>From 1937 Borges worked as a cataloguer at the Miguel Cane
branch of the Buenos Aires Municipal Library. The job did not interest
him and he usually disappeared into the basement to read (especially
Kafka), write, and translate. The never-ending process of cataloguing
inspired one of Borges's most famous short stories, 'The Library of
Babel' (1941), in which the faithful catalog of the Library is
supplemented with "thousands and thousands of false catalogs, the proof
of the falsity of those false catalogs, a proof of the falsity of the <i>true</i>
catalog". Borges spent nine years at the suburban library. He was fired
in 1946 from his post by the Péron regime, and appointed poultry
inspector for Buenos Aires Municipal Market, a position he declined. </p>
      <p>Borges's political opinions were not considered inoffensive.
As a sign of negative attention, an attempt was made to bomb the house
where Borges lived with his mother. His sister was imprisoned and his
mother was placed under house arrest. With he help Miguel Cohen-Miller,
a psychotherapist, Borges managed to overcome his shyness and he could
accept lecture offers. Dr Cohen-Miller also noted that Borges was
exaggerated sensitive, had guilt feeling and fear of sex. Later Estela
Canto, whom Borges met in 1944, wrote in <i>Borges a contraluz</i>
(1989), that Borges's attitude toward sex was one of "panic and
terror". </p>
      <p>In 1946 Borges took over the editorship of Los Annales de
Buenos Aires, an academic magazine. His first story in English, 'The
Garden of Forking Paths', was published in 1948 in <i>Ellery Queen
Mystery Magazine</i>. After Peron's deposition in 1955 Borges became
Director of the National Library. "I speak of God's splendid irony in
granting me at once 800 000 book and darkness," Borges noted alluding
to his now almost complete blindness. Borges also was professor of
English literature at the University of Buenos Aires, and taught there
from 1955 to 1970. </p>
      <p>Borges shared the Prix Formentor with Samuel Beckett in 1961.
After the death of his mother, his constant companion, Borges started
his series of visits to countries all over the world, continuing
traveling until his death. In 1967 Borges began a five-year period of
collaboration with Norman Thomas di Giovanni, and gained new fame in
the English-speaking world. When Juan Perón was again elected president
in 1973, Borges resigned as director of the National Library. Despite
his opposition to Perón and later to the junta, his support to liberal
causes were considered too ambiguous. "If he thinks like a dinosaur,
that has nothing to do with my thinking," said once the Chilean poet
and Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda. "He doesn't understand a thing about
what's happening in the modern world, and he thinks I don't either." In
1980 Borges signed protests against the political repression and the
"disappeared". In 1982 he condemned the Falkland Islands War &#8211; "Two
bald men fighting over a comb" was his cited comment in the
international media. </p>
      <p>Borges, who had long suffered from eye problems, was totally
blind in his last decades, but never taught himself Braille. He had a
congenital defect that had afflicted several generations on his
father's side of the family. However, he continued to publish several
books, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">El libro de
los seres imaginario</span> (1967),<span style="font-style: italic;"> El informe de Brodie</span> (1970), and <span style="font-style: italic;">El libro de arena</span> (1975). "I need
books," he once said. "They mean everything to me." In New Orleas he
developed a passion to jazz. </p>
      <p>Borges was married twice. In 1967 he married his old friend,
the recently widowed Elsa Asteta Millán, whom he had met decades ago
when she was just seventeen.&nbsp;Elsa shared none of his literary
interests and the marriage lasted three years. One night at Harvard,
Borges was found outside the residence, in his pajamas,
because&nbsp;she had locked him out. Since divorce did not exist in
Argentina, they entered into a legal separation agreement, and Borges
moved back in with his mother. His last years Borges lived with María
Kodama, his assistant; they married on 22 April in 1986, though his
marriage to Elsa had never been annulled. However, the relationship
brought much happiness in the authors life. Kodoma had earlier
participated in Borges's Old English study group and earned doctorate
in English from the University of Buenos Aires. In 1984 they produced
an account of their journeys in different places of the world, with
text by Borges and photographs by Kodoma. Borges moved in 1985
permanently to Geneva, Switzerland.&nbsp;Far from Buenos Aires&nbsp;he
died there of liver cancer on June 14, 1986, and was buried at the old
Plainpalais Cemetery. </p>
      <p>Borges's fictional universe was born from his vast and
esoteric readings in literature, philosophy, and theology. He sees
man's search for meaning in an infinite universe as a fruitless effort.
In the universe of energy, mass, and speed of light, Borges considers
the central riddle time, not space. "He believed in an infinite series
of times, in a growing, dizzying net of divergent, convergent and
parallel times. This network of times which approached one another,
forked, broke off, or were unaware of one another for centuries,
embraces<i> all </i>possibilities of time." The theological
speculations of Gnosticism and the Cabala gave ideas for many of his
plots. Borges has told in an interview that when he was a boy, he found
an engraving of the seven wonders of the world, one of which portrayed
a circular labyrinth. It frightened him and the maze has been one of
his recurrent nightmares. "Almost instantly, I
understood: 'The garden of forking paths' was the chaotic novel; the
phrase 'the various futures (not to all)' suggested to me the forking
in time, not in space. A broad rereading of the work confirmed the
theory. In all fictional works, each time a man is confronted with
several alternatives, he chooses one and eliminates the others; in the
fiction of Ts'ui Pên, he chooses &#8211; simultaneously &#8211; all of them. He <i>creates</i>,
in this way, diverse futures, diverse time which themselves also
proliferate and fork." <font size="2">(from 'The Garden of Forking
Paths') </font></p>
      <p>Another recurrent image is the mirror, which reflects
different identities. The idea for the short story 'Borges y yo' was
came from the double, who was looking at him &#8211; the <i>alter ego</i>,
the other I. There is a well-known man, who writes his stories, a name
in some biographical dictionary, and the real person. "So my life is a
point-counterpoint, a kind of fugue, and a falling away - and
everything winds up being lost to me, and everything falls into
oblivion, or into the hands of the other man." </p>
      <p>Influenced by the English philosopher George Berkeley
(1685-1753), Borges played with the idea that concrete reality may
consist only of mental perceptions. The "real world" is only one
possible in the infinite series of realities. These themes were
examined among others in the classical short stories 'The Garden of
Forking Paths' and 'Death and the Compass', in which Borges showed his
fondness of detective formula. In the story the calm, rational
detective and adventurer Erik Lönnrot (referring to the
philologist/poet <a href="lonnrot.htm">Elias Lönnrot</a>, 1802-1884,
the collector of <a href="kalevala.htm">Kalevala</a> poems) finds
himself trapped in cryptographic labyrinths in a fantastical city,
while attempting to solve a series of crimes. However, Borges's Lönnrot
has more in common with C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes and Father
Brown and their amazing powers of deduction than with the Finnish
namesake, who traveled in the northwest Russia to collected ancient
poems. The <i>Kalevala</i> was created by Lönnrot, edited from poems
of his own and a number of separate poems and poem-fragments he had
received from rune-singers. In similar way, Erik Lönnrot creates a
coherent story from a series of crimes by interpreting cryptic messages
and filling the holes with his own insights. Detective stories bring
order into chaos. "In this chaotic era of ours," said Borges, "one
thing is has humbly maintained the classic virtues: the detective
story. For a detective story cannot be understood without a beginning,
middle, and end... I would say in defense of the detective novel that
it needs no defense; though now read with a certain disdain, it is
safeguarding order in an era of disorder." <font size="2">('The
Detective Story', 1978) </font></p>
      <p>In 'The Library of Babel' the symmetrically structured library
represents the universe as it is conceived by rational man, and the
library's illegible books refers to man's ignorance. In 'Tlön, Uqbar,
Orbis Tertius' Borges invented a whole other universe based on an
imaginary encyclopedia. The narrator states, that 'Tlön is surely a
labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth devised by men, a labyrinth destined
to be deciphered by men." </p>
      <p>As an essayist Borges drew on his European education and
brought attention to ancient philosophers and mystics, Jewish cabbalist
and gnostics, French poets, Cervantes, Dante, Schopenhauer, and above
all such English writers as Shakespeare, John Milton, Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, Thomas De Quincey, H.G. Wells, and G.K. Chesterton. His key
books were<span style="font-style: italic;"> Discusión</span> (1932), <span style="font-style: italic;">Historia de la eternidad</span> (1936), and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Otras inquisiciones</span> (1952). When
many Latin American writers dealt with political or social subjects,
Borges focused on eternal questions and the literary heritage of the
world. However, Borges has criticized his friend <a href="neruda.htm">Pablo
Neruda</a>, a politically highly visible author, for denouncing all the
South American dictators except Juan Perón, Borges's own arch-enemy.
"Perón was then in power. It seems that Neruda had a lawsuit pending
with his publisher in Buenos Aires. That publisher, as you probably
know, has always been his principal source of income."<font size="2">
