<p>
British poet, painter, visionary mystic, and engraver, who illustrated
and printed his own books. Blake proclaimed the supremacy of the imagination over the rationalism 
and materialism of the 18th-century. He joined for a time the <a href="sweden.htm">Swedenborgian</a> Church of 
the New Jerusalem in London and considered Newtonian science to be superstitious nonsense. Mocking criticism 
and misunderstanding  shadowed Blake's career as a writer and artist
 and it was left to later generations to recognize his importance. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>To see a world in a grain of sand </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And heaven in a wild flower </font><br>
<font size="2">Hold infinity in the palm of your hand </font><br>
<font size="2">And eternity in an hour. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Auguries of Innocence') </font></blockquote>

<p>William Blake was born in Soho, London, where he spent most of his
life. The house of his parents, on the corner of Broad Street and
Marshall Street, was erected upon an old burial ground. His father,
James Blake, was a successful London hosier, who was attracted by the
doctrines of Emmanuel
Swedenborg and deeply opposed to the Court. Blake was first educated at
home, chiefly by his mother, Catherine Wright Armitage; her first
husband, also a hosier, had died in 1751. When she married James in
1752, she was thirty. Blake's first biographer, Frederick Tatham, wrote
that Blake "depised restraints &amp; rules, so much that his Father
dare not send him to School." <br>
</p>
      <p>From his early years, Blake had
experienced visions of angels and ghostly monks, he saw and conversed
with the angel Gabriel, the Virgin Mary, and various historical
figures.
Blake's parents encouraged him to collect prints of the Italian
masters, and his father gave him engravings and plaster casts. Gothic
art and architecture influenced him, and the work of Adam Ghisi and
Albert Dürer. </p>

 
<p>In 1767 Blake was sent to Henry Pars' drawing school, at No. 101 the Strand. 
 
At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to the engraver 
James Basire, working for him twelve hours a day, six days a week. Only on Sundays Blake returned to his 
family home. After studies at the Royal Academy School, where he did not have much 
respect for Sir Joshua Reynolds, the president of the Academy, Blake 
started to  produce  watercolors and engrave illustrations for magazines. <br>
</p>
      <p>When Blake met Catherine Boucher, the daughter of a market
gardener, he was rcovering from rejection by another woman. Catherine
fainted on being introduced to him. They married in 1783; Catherine who was ílliterate signed her wedding contract with an "X". The
marriage was childless &#8211; none of Blake's siblings had children. Blake
taught Catherine to draw and paint and how to use a printing press. She
assisted him devoutly. Just before his death Blake drew a portrait of
her, saying, "you have ever been an angel to me". Blake's younger
brother Robert, who had died of consumption when he was twenty-five,
regularly visited him in dreams. Once Robert adviced him in printing
technology. <br>
 </p>


<p> Blake's important cultural and social contacts included Henry Fuseli, who 
was a Member of the Royal Academy, 
Reverend A.S. Mathew and his wife, John Flaxman (1755-1826), a sculptor and draftsman, Tom Paine, William Godwin, 
and Mrs Elizabeth Montagu (1720-1800), married to the wealthy grandson of the earl of Sandwich. Blake never 
met the Swedish philosopher and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, who died in London in 1772, but he read widely 
Swedenborg's writings in his search for ancient truths, before turning to the writings of 
<a href="parace.htm">Paracelsus</a> and Jacob Boehme. </p>
<p>His early poems Blake wrote at the age of 12. However, being early apprenticed to a manual occupation, 
journalistic-social career was not open to him. His first book of poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">Poetical Sketches</span>, came out in 1783 
and was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Songs of Innocence</span> (1789), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Songs of Experience </span>(1794). Each copy of <i>Songs of Innocence</i> was 
unique and the poems were never in the same order. The book was not a commercial or critical success. <br>
</p>
      <p>Blake's most famous poem,
'The Tyger', was part of his <i>Songs of Experience</i>. Typical for Blake's poems were long, flowing lines 
and violent energy, combined with aphoristic clarity and moments of lyric tenderness. Blake was not blinded 
by conventions, but approached his subjects sincerely with a mind unclouded by current opinions. On the other 
hand this made him also an outsider. He approved of free love, and sympathized with the actions of the French 
revolutionaries but the Reign of Terror sickened him. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1790 Blake
engraved <span style="font-style: italic;">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span>,  his principal prose work,  
 
in which he expressed his revolt against the established values of his time:  "Prisons 
are built with stones of Law, brothels with bricks of Religion." Radically 
Blake sided with the Satan in Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>
and attacked the conventional religious views in a series of
paradoxical aphorisms. In Hell he walked around like a tourist. The
poet's life in the realms of images did not please his wife who once
remarked: "I have very little of Mr. Blake's company. He is always in
Paradise." Some of Blake's contemporaries called him a harmless
lunatic. The Examiner dismissed him as "an unfortunate lunatic" who had
published "a farrago of nonsense, unintelligibliness, and egregious
vanity, the wild effusions of a distempered brain." George III shouted
"Take them away! Take them away! when he was shown some of Blake's
drawings. <br>
      </p>


<p><a href="fuseli.htm">Henry Fuseli</a>, who was sixteen years Blake's senior, recognized also a debt to him, and 
Fuseli was the only contemporary artist, whose 'superiority' Blake seems to have acknowledged. 
Blake's writings did not interest Fuseli, but when he required a good draughtsman to 
prepare a frontispiece to his translation of Lavater's <i>Aphorisms on Man</i>, which 
Joseph Johnson was about to publish, he asked Blake to do the engraving. 
However, Blake was not an easy person to get along with, especially in a subordinate role, 
and although they worked together on a 
number of designs, by 1803 their  paths had separated.  Fuseli is said to have admitted that 
"Blake is d&#8212;good to steal from." 
</p>

<p>In 1774 
Blake opened with his wife and younger brother Robert a print shop at 27 Broad Street, but the venture failed 
after the death of Robert in 1787. Moreover,&nbsp; deadlines were always too short for him. Immediately upon his death Blake slept for three days and nights. 
The Blakes moved south of the Thames to Lambeth in 1790, where they had more room. During this
time Blake began to work on his 'prophetic books', where he recorded 
his lifelong concern with the struggle of the soul to free its natural
energies from reason and organized religion. <br>
</p>
      <p>Although Blake first accepted Swedenborg's 
ideas, he eventually rejected him. His mythical and visionary world he 
recorded in <span style="font-style: italic;">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</span> (1793), in which the motto is, "The Eye sees more than the Heart knows", America: a Prophecy (1793), about the rebellion of 
American colonies and the British response, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Book of Urizen </span>(1794), an introduction to his cosmogony, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Song of Los&nbsp;</span> (1795), and   
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Europe</span> (1794), which
contains one of his most extraordinary images, God measuring the abyss
below him with a pair of compasses. Blake hated the effects of the
Industrial Revolution in England and looked forward to the
establishment of a New Jerusalem "in England's green and pleasant
land." Between 1804 and 1818 he produced an edition of his own poem <span style="font-style: italic;">Jerusalem&nbsp;</span> with 100 engravings. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Bring me my Bow of burning gold: </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2"> </font><font size="2">Bring me my Arrows of desire: </font><br>
<font size="2">Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold! </font><br>
<font size="2">Bring me my Chariot of Fire." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Jerusalem' in <i>Milton</i>, 1804-1808) </font></blockquote>

<p>In 1800 Blake was taken up by the wealthy William Hayley, poet and
patron of poets, who had a house in Felpham, Sussex, and whose writings 
he began to illustrate, executing also other commissions. 
The Blakes rented a cottage at Felpham, 
staying there for three years. In a letter to a friend he wrote: 
"Meat is cheaper than in London, but the sweet air&amp;the voices of winds, trees&amp;birds, 
&amp;the odours of the happy ground, makes it a dwelling for immortals." </p>

<p>In this period, his attention was again drawn to Milton, perhaps after 
discussions with Hayley. <span style="font-style: italic;">Milton:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">A Poem in a Books To Justify the Ways of God to Men</span> was finished  and 
engraved between 1803 and 1808. After exchanging some heated words in argument with 
Private John Scofield, 
 Blake was charged in 1803 at Chichester 
with high treason for having uttered such expressions 
as "D-n the King, d-n all his subjects..." 	Blake was acquitted, and as 
the <i>Sussex Advertiser</i> later reported, the verdict "so gratified the auditory that the 
court was, in defiance of all decency, thrown into an uproar by their noisy 
exultations". <br>
</p>
      <p>Blake's exhibition in 1809 at the shop once owned by his brother was
 commercially unsuccessful. However, economic problems did not diminish his creativity, 
but he continued to produce energetically
poems, aphorisms, and engravings. "The tigers of wrath are wiser than the 
horses of instruction," he wrote. While working on his own version of the 
Canterbury Pilgrims, Blake produced <span style="font-style: italic;">The Four Zoas</span>, first called <span style="font-style: italic;">Vala</span>. The 
long epic poems was rediscovered in 1889, and 
published in <i>The Writings of William Blake</i> (1893). Many 
of its drawings are erotic; the central motif is the erect penis. </p>


<p>In his old age,  Blake enjoyed the admiration of a group
of young artist, known as 'The Ancients'. One of them 
called him "divine Blake", who "had seen God, sir, and had talked with angels". 
 Moreover, he was many times helped by 
John Linnell, an younger artist. 
Blake's last years were passed in obscurity, quarreling even with some of the 
circle of friends who supported him. Among Blake's later works are drawings and
engravings for 	Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> and the 21 illustrations to 
the book of Job, which was completed when he was almost  70 years old. 
Blake never managed to get out of poverty, in large part due to his  inability 
to  
compete with fast engravers 
and his expensive invention that enabled him to design illustrations 
and print  words at the same time. </p>

<p>Independent through his life, Blake left no debts at his death on 
August 12, 1827. He was buried in a common grave at the Dissenter's burial  
ground in Bunhill Fields, where his parents lie. Over the years, four bodies were placed 
above him. Catherine's final resting place was also at Bunhill Fields, but her 
grave was not near her husband. 
<a href="wordswor.htm">Wordsworth's</a> verdict after Blake's death reflected many opinions 
of the time: "There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something 
in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter 
Scott."  Blake's influence 
grew through Pre-Raphealites and <a href="wbyeats.htm">W.B. Yeats</a> 
especially in Britain. His interest in legend was revived with the
Romantics' rediscovery of the past, especially the Gothic and medieval. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the 1960s Blake's work was acclaimed by the Underground movement. 
The American rock group The Doors took its name from Aldous Huxley's book 
<i>The Doors of Perception</i>, which refers to a line in  
<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>: "If the doors of perception
were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite." T.S.
Eliot wrote in his essay on Blake that "the concentration resulting
from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy is one of the
reasons why Dante is a classic and Blake only a poet of genius."<font size="2"> (from<i> Selected Essays</i>, 1960) </font></p>
