<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Anthropologist and author of a
number of book describing the teaching of Don Juan, a Yaqui sorcerer
and shaman. Castaneda kept himself out of the public eye and there has
been much debate as to whether or not his books are documented fact or
entirely fiction. Castaneda's ideas influenced deeply the New Age
movement.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Don Juan had told us that the human
beings are divided in two. The right side, which he called the tonal,
encompasses everything the intellect can conceive of. The left side,
called the nagual, is a realm of indescribable features: a realm
impossible to contain in words. The left side is perhaps comprehended,
if comprehension is what takes place, with the total body; there its
resistance to conceptualization." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Eagle's Gift</font></i><font size="2">, 1981) </font></blockquote>
<p>According to immigration records, revealed by <i>Time </i>magazine,
Carlos Castaneda was born in Cajamarca, Peru, the son of César Arana
Burungaray, a goldsmith, and Susan Castaneda Navoa. The family moved to
Lima in 1948 and Castaneda entered the Colegio Nacional de Nuestra
Señora de Guadelupe. After graduation he studied painting and sculpture
at the National School of Fine Arts. Castaneda himself has claimed that
he was born at São Paulo, Brazil, into a well-known family of Italian
descent. He has told that his grandmother was an anarchist, and his
grandfather was sexually obsessed: "You can't fuck <i>all</i> the women in the world," was his teaching, "but you can try!" </p>
<p>Castaneda was raised by his grandparents in the isolated Brazilian
outback. He was then placed in a Buenos Aires boarding school. At the
age of fifteen or sixteen he moved to the United States (in some
sources in 1951), where he settled with a foster family in Los Angeles.
After graduating from Hollywood High School he studied parapsychology
at Los Angeles City College from 1955 to 1959. At the University of
California in Los Angeles he studied anthropology. In 1959 he became an
American citizen and took the name Castaneda <font face="Symbol"></font><font face="Symbol">-</font>
his father's surname was Aranha. Some sources mention that Castaneda
married in 1960 an American woman, Margaret Runyon, who was 14 years
older. Their marriage lasted only for some months, although they
separated officially in 1973. Castaneda has said that he'd had a
vasectomy and their adopted son, named C.J., had been fathered by one
of Castaneda's friends. </p>
<p>Later Castaneda's close friend was Florinda Donner, who met him in the 1970s. Her book, <i>Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerer's World</i>,
appeared in 1991. Castaneda and Donner married in 1993. "To ask me to
verify my life by giving you my statistics, is like using science to
validate sorcery," Castaneda once explained. "It robs the world of its
magic and makes milestones out of us all."<font size="2"> </font></p>
<p>In the summer of 1960 Castaneda met Don Juan Matus, an elderly Yaqui
Indian, at a bus station in Nogales, Arizona. Castaneda had started to
make trips to Mexico to study medinical plants. Margareta did not
accompany him on these trips. </p>
<p>Don Juan has remained a mysterious figure, no one else has met him.
After Castaneda's several visits from Los Angeles to the border regions
of Mexico, Don Juan revealed that he was in fact a <i>diablero</i>, a
sorcerer. Next year Castaneda became his apprentice, which continued
the famous pupil-teacher relationship familiar from the history of
philosophy and literature <font face="Symbol">-</font> fictional or real <font face="Symbol">-</font>
starting from Plato and Socrates, Sancho Panza and Don Quixote, James
Boswell and Dr. Johnson, to Stalin and Lenin. Don Juan also introduced
him don Genaro Flores, a Mazatec Indian, who would serve as another
tutor.</p>
<p>In his apprentice years Castaneda used peyote (called 'Mescalito'),
datura (Jimson weed), and Psilocybe mexicana mushrooms to enlarge his
vision of reality. This period of learning lasted from 1961 to the
autumn of 1965, when Castaneda decided to terminate it <font face="Symbol">-</font> he feared a total psychic breakdown. These experiences were the basis for Castaneda's first book, <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge</em> </span></span>(1968),
published by the University of California Press. The analysis of the
beliefs of Don Juan, a drug-using sorcerer, was accepted as his
master's thesis, although Castaneda did not show any field notes <font face="Symbol">-</font> <font face="r_symbol"></font>he claimed he had lost them<font face="Symbol"></font>. An expression of the drug culture of the 1960s, <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i>
first gained reputation as an underground classic. After Simon and
Schuster purchased the book for mass release, it turned into an
international bestseller. </p>
<p>In 1968 Castaneda returned to Mexico, where he started his second period of learning, which lasted until 
1971. This period produced <em>A Separate Reality: Further Conversations with Don Juan</em>&nbsp;(1971). Ted Hughes wrote 
in his review: "Castaneda becomes the guinea-pig hero of a modern quest as the weir glamour of the 
hypnotic, manipulating, profound, foxy old Indian carries him, with his notebooks and tape recorder, into 
regions where the words 'rational' and 'scientific' are violently redefined." Castaneda's third book,<em>&nbsp;<span class="st">Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan </span></em>
 (1972) was accepted as his doctoral dissertation by the UCLA 
Anthropology Department in 1973. The mainstream anthropologists were outraged and his work was labelled as the greatest 
science hoax since the Piltdown Man. </p>

<p>In <em>The Second Ring of Power</em> (1978) Castaneda encountered
Don Juan's women disciples. The popularity of his books also became a
great burden for Castaneda. He was hounded by "very strange people" and
he lived as a virtual recluse. In an interview he said: "I try to live
the way Don Juan demands, using all my strengths and efficiency. The
result is I work my head off." </p>
<p>In his later years, Castaneda started to lecture on <i>Tensegrity</i>,
a combination of all kinds of New Age magic. Originally the term was
coided by Buckmister Fuller, and related to structural tension and
integrity in architecture. Castaneda died of liver cancer on April 27,
1998, at his home in Westwood. His cremated remains were taken to
Mexico. Castaneda wrote 11 books, which have been translated
into&nbsp;some 20&nbsp;languages. Castaneda's last&nbsp;work was <em>The Active Side of Infinity</em><strong> </strong>(1999), about entering life in the Next 
World. In Martin Goodman's novel <i>I Was Carlos Castaneda</i> (2001) the author 
comes back from the dead to tell about eternal life. </p><p>When the Italian film director <a href="felli.htm">Federico Fellini</a>
met Castaneda in Rome, he found nothing in the author's stocky physical
appearance to suggest that he's a shaman. Castaneda&nbsp;told him that
Don Juan had seen his film <em>La Strada</em>.&nbsp;Fellini continued:
"Independently of don Juan, who is charming in a literary way and whom
we are made to see as an old sage, I couldn't help being invaded at
times by a feeling of strangeness. As if I were confronted with a
vision of a world dictated by a quartz! Or a green lizard!" Fellini
planned to make a film, a barely veiled satire,&nbsp;based on
Castaneda's work. The screenplay, entitled<em> Viaggio a Tulun</em>, was adapted by the noted Italian cartoonist Milo Manera as <em>Viaggio a Tulum</em> and published in the magazine <em><a href="hugoprat.htm">Corto Maltese</a> </em>in 1989. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics have pointed out, that nobody except Castaneda has ever seen
Don Juan. The absence of Yaqui terms and modest evidence of the
existence of Don Juan undermine the credibility of Castaneda's works.
According to the author, Don Juan was born in 1891 and was part of the
diaspora of Yaquis all over Mexico. Castaneda has defended his use of
drugs that they were part of his initial phase of apprenticeship. Don
Juan taught him later to achieve the same results without drugs. "It's
one, it's unity, it is ourselves," said a Huichol shaman, Ramón Medina
Silva, to the anthropologist Barbara Meyerhoff of the purpose of the
peyote ceremony. Don Juan died in 1973.</p>
