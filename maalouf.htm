<p>Lebanese journalist and novelist, whose native language was Arabic
but who writes in French. Most of Maalouf's books have a historical
setting, and like Umberto Eco, Orhan Pamuk, and Arturo Pérez-Reverte,
Maalouf mixes fascinating historical facts with fantasy and
philosophical ideas. In an interview Maalouf has said that his role as
a writer is to create "positive myths". Maalouf's works, written with
the skill of a master storyteller, offer a sensitive view of the values
and attitudes of different cultures in the Middle East, Africa and
Mediterranean world. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Is not one of the virtues of writing to
be able to set down the trivia and the exceptional on the same flat
sheet of paper. Nothing in a book seems any more profound than the ink
in which it is written."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The First Century After Beatrice</font></i><font size="2">, 1992)</font></blockquote>
<p>Amin Maalouf, a Catholic Arab, was born in Beirut, Lebanon, into a cultured family, 
which had a tradition of business, too. His father, Ruchdi Maalouf, 
was a writer, teacher, and journalist. Odette, Maalouf's mother, was from a Maronite Christian family. 
In <i>Origins: a Memoir</i>
(2004) Maalouf tells of his grandfather Botros, a schoolteacher and
failed businessman, and his younger brother Gebrayel, who built up a
successful retail enterprise in Havana. Maalouf attended French Jesuit
schools in Beirut and after studying sociology and economics, he
continued the long family tradition and became a journalist. </p>
<p>At the age of 22, Maalouf started to work for the leading Beirut daily <i>an-Nahar</i> and travelled 
in India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, and Algeria, often covering wars and other conflicts. 
In 1975, frightened by Muslim and PLO strength, Christian militias attacked Muslims, which led to civil war. 
The horrors of war entered Maalouf's own homeland and in 1977 he emigrated with his wife and three 
children to Paris, where they have lived ever since. After moving to France Maalouf has travelled 
little. In 1994 he visited Lebanon -- for the 
first time since the 1970s. Part of the year Maalouf has spend  on one of the Channel 
Islands where he writes his novels in a little fisherman's house. His books have been translated 
into more than 20 languages.</p>
<p>Maalouf continued to work as a journalist, writing for<i> Jeune Afrique</i> and <i>An-nahar Arabe 
et International</i>. Maalouf's first book, <i>The Crusades Through Arab Eyes</i>,
appeared in 1983. Although Western research has scrutinized the
religious zeal, and political and economic maneuvers behind the
Crusades (1096-1291), Maalouf's book, in which he used Arab accounts,
brought to the clash of Eastern and Western cultures a fresh and lesser
examined perspective. In the first chapter Maalouf quotes Saladin who
said: "Behold with what obstinacy they fight for their religion, while
we, the Muslims, show no enthusiasm for waging holy war." Maalouf
argued that from the Crusades the west became identified with the
forces of progress and Arabs became identified as victims after their
traumatic encounter with an alien culture. Maalouf's views have been
reviewed by a number of writers dealing with the theme of crusades and
the conflict between Islam and Christianity. </p>

<p>Maalouf's characters often find themselves in conflict with the
beliefs of their surroundings and time, as the Mesopotamian prophet
Mani (c. 216-276) in <i>The Gardens of Light</i> (1991), who preached his tolerant doctrine of 'The Gospel of Light', or the restless traveller Hassan Al-Wazzan from <i>Leo the African</i>
(1986), a geographer who roamed Africa and the Mediterranean lands in
the 16th-century. Actually very little is known of the real person
behind his myth. Leo's narration of his life, from Granada, his
birthplace, to his residence in Fez, echoes Maalouf's own years in
exile and the fate of his own native country: "Before Fez, I had never
set foot in a city, never observed the swarming activity of the
alleyways, never felt that powerful breath on my face, like the wind
from the sea, heavy with cries and smells. Of course, I was born in
Granada, the stately capital of the kingdom of Andalus, but it was
already late in the century, and I knew it only in its death agonies,
emptied of its citizens and its souls, humiliated, faded, and when I
left our quarter of al-Baisin it was no longer anything for my family
but a vast encampment, hostile and ruined." In Rome, Leo completed his
magnum opus, the famous description of African geography. It is
believed that he wrote the work first in Arabic. In 1550 it was
published in Italian under the title <i>Della descrittione dell'Africa et delle cose notabli che ivi sono</i>. </p>
<p>In 1993 Maalouf received the Prix de Goncourt for his novel <i>Le rocher de tanios </i>(The
Rock of Tanios). The acclaimed story-within-a-story was set in the 19th
century Lebanon. Its central characters are Sheikh Francis, a Christian
Arab, and the sheikh's illegitimate offspring, Tanios. Through their
fates and legends Maalouf creates a historical romance filled with
local myths, worldwide political games, treachery, and love. The title
of the book refers to a peculiar rock formation, looking like a great
stone chair, that dominates the Lebanese village of Kfaryabda. </p>
<p>In <i>Samarkand </i>(1989) Maalouf spins fact and fiction around the history of the manuscript of the <i>Rubaiyaat</i> of<a href="khayyam.htm"> Omar Khayyam</a>,
created in Samarkand in 1072 A.D. The manuscript is claimed to have
vanished on the maiden voyage of the Titanic. Maalouf gives the reader
an exotic and vivid picture of 11th-century Persia, with assassins and
intrigues, and returns to it 900 years later through the eyes of an
American academic searching for the manuscript. </p>
<p>Maalouf has regularly used fantasy elements in his novels, but <i>The First Century after Beatrice</i>
(1992) was his first full-length futuristic tale, in which female birth
has become increasingly rare due to a new fertility drug. The scarcity
of girls and women upsets the balance of sexes, and baby girls are
kidnapped to be sold in countries where there is a shortage. Maalouf
touches on several themes - the antagonism between the rich,
technologically advanced Western countries and the poor South, corrupt
science and sexual discrimination. "And the journalists? Where does his
passion lie? Is it solely in the observation of human butterflies,
human spiders, their hunting and their love affairs? No. Your job
becomes sublime, incomparable, when it allows you to read the image of
the future in the present, for the entire future is to be found in the
present, but masked, coded, in a dispersed order." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The First Century after Beatrice</font></i><font size="2">)</font> <i>Ports Of Call </i>(1999)
was a bittersweet love story which dealt with the troubled history of
the modern Middle East. The protagonist, Ossyane Ketabdar, travels in
the 1930s to Paris to study. When World War II reaches France, he
abandons his passivity, and becomes a Resistance hero, fulfilling his
family traditions. After returning to Beirut, he marries Clara, a
Jewish woman. But now the wars tear families apart. </p>
<p>Behind the story of <i>Balthasar's Odyssey </i>(2000) is the number 666 and the year of 
1666, the "year of the Apocalypse", which Maalouf explores through the experiences of 
Balthasar Embriaco, an Italian bookseller. With his companions he tries to track down a book, 
Abu-Maher al-Mazandarani's <i>The Unveiling of the Hidden Name</i>, which may contain the 
hundredth name of God. In Islam there are 99 names for God. To know the 100th, the name that 
may be missing from the Koran, is to ensure one's salvation. Balthasar is a Catholic but he 
views organized religion sceptically, and with his observations he comes close to a modern 
intellectual. Balthasar finds the book and loses it, twice, and almost perishes in the Great 
Fire of London. "What is common to Maalouf's wide-ranging works... is his apparent belief 
that through examining and understanding a particular historical period we can gain a better 
understanding of our present time." <font size="2">(Ian Sansom in</font><i><font size="2"> 
The Guardian</font></i><font size="2">, October 12, 2002) </font> </p>
<p>The Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho based her first opera <i>L'amour de loin</i>  (Love From Afar) on 
Maalouf's libretto  about  a  distant love of a 12th-century troubadour, Jaufré Rudel, for a 
countess in Tripoli. The opera was produced in Salzburg (2000) and in Paris (2001) at Chatelet theater,  
directed by Peter Sellars. <font size="2"> </font>"Idealized love is a well-worn theme," 
wrote Anthony Tommasini in his review, "but Mr. Maalouf has found a fresh way to revisit it. Mr. 
Maalouf's words invite music, and Ms. Saariaho has provided a lushly beautiful score, structured in 
five continuous acts lasting two hours." <font size="2">( </font><i><font size="2">The New York 
Times,   </font></i><font size="2">August 17, 2000) </font>Maalouf has also written lyrics to Saariaho's 
songs, 'Quatre instants', which were performed by the opera singer Karita Mattila in April 2004. 
Saariaho's second opera, based on Maalouf's libretto <i>Adriana Mater</i>, premiered in 2006 in Paris. 
Set in a civil-war torn country, it tells of a mother, who is a victim of a rape, her child, and  the 
choice between violence and nonviolence. Maalouf was also commissioned to write the 
libretto for Saariaho's opera <i>Émilie</i>, drawing 
on the colorful life of  Voltaire's mistress, the 
physicist and astronomer Émilie du Chatelet (1706-1749), who translated 
Newton's <i>Principia Mathematica</i>
into French. The opera openED in March 2010, in Lyon, with Karita
Mattila singing in the title role. "The immediate problem is that
Saariaho's score and Amin Maalouf's libretto fail to develop any
dramatic momentum or conflict", said Rupert Christiansen in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.
