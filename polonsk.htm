<p>American director and screenwriter who wrote essays, radio scripts
and several novels before starting his career in Hollywood. Polonsky
was blacklisted by the House on Un-American Activities Committee for
refusal to cooperate during the anti-Communist witch hunt of the 1950s.
His most famous works as a screenwriter include the classic boxing film
<span style="font-style: italic;">Body and Soul</span> (1947), directed by Robert Rossen. Its influence can be seen in Martin Scorsese's <i>Raging Bull </i>(1980) and also in Sylvester Stallone's Rocky movies. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"First of all, directing is an idea that
you have of a total flow of images that are going on, which are
incidentally actors, words, and objects in space. It's an idea you have
of yourself, like the idea you have of your own personality which finds
its best representation in the world in terms of specific flows of
imaginary images. That's what directing is."</b> (Polonsky in </font><font size="2"><i>Directing the Film</i> by Ed Sherman, 1976) </font></blockquote>


<p>Abraham Polonsky was born in New York City, the oldest son of a
Russian-Jewish immigrants. His father, who spoke and wrote several
languages, was a pharmacist, and a graduate from the University of
Columbia. His socialist ideals influenced deeply Polonsky, who read
voraciously books from their home collections. At an early age,
Polonsky decided to become a writer. Later in the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Zenia's Way</span>
(1980) Polonsky portrayed his father, who dreamed of returning to
school and being a doctor : "Mostly, though, he seemed to be wanting to
have a different profession entirely and often spoke of it as if it
were still possible. Anyway he was clever and witty about it." </p>

<p>In 1928, Polonsky entered the New York City College. After
graduating, he studied at Columbia Law School, receiving his B.A.
(1935). He practiced law for a few years and taught at the New York
City College. In 1937, he left his work as a lawyer and decided to
devote himself to writing, beginning from radio plays. "Writing good
sentences is a gift," Polonsky has said in an interview. "And writing
good dialogue is a special gift." Probably in the late 1930s, Polonsky
also joined the American Communist Party. He participated in the union
politics and established and edited a local newspaper, <i>The Home Front</i>. In 1940, Polonsky published his first novel, a mystery story <span style="font-style: italic;">The Goose Is Cooked</span>, which he wrote with Mitchell A. Wilson, using co-pseudonym Emmert Hogarth.</p>

<p>Before signing a screenwriter's contract with Paramount, Polonsky
published another novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Enemy Sea</span> (1943), which was dedicated to National 
Maritime Union. During World War II, Polonsky served with the OSS in Europe, and  moved 
to Hollywood after the war.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Charley: "When I lose the championship, they'll have 
to carry me out."</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Lloyd Goff: "This gym is full of guys who were carried out." 
</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Body and Soul</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

 
<p>In Paramount Polonsky's script for Mitchell Leisen's <span style="font-style: italic;">Golden Earrings</span>
was thoroughly revised. His intended film about the Gypsy holocaust was
turned into a romantic spy story, starring Marlene Dietrich. The film
failed badly both with the critics and the
public, but its haunting song, sung by Murvyn Vye, became a hit
recording in 1947-48 by Peggy Lee. With this experience still fresh in
his mind, Polonsky joined the new independent company Enterprise
Studios and made the screenplay for Robert Rossen´s <i>Body and Soul</i>, about money, fame and selling one's soul. John
Garfield played Charlie, who has left his poor neighborhood, friends
and family, and gained fame as a boxer. He is obsessed with money and
fame, and prefers the company of those who flatter him. After signing a
contract with a gangster, he ordered to take a dive and lose his title.
The crucial scene in the ring was intensely shot by James Wong Howe.
Rossen himself had been a former prizefighter. Polonsky juxtaposed the
world of money with friendship and love, and the boxing arena becomes a
metaphor for survival under the rules of capitalism. The film was
nominated for an Academy Award. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"<i>Body and Soul</i> made money. It was a hit. 
When it was a hit, I was a hit. I had never directed anything. But I figured I 
could do it. And I could. I knew that was where the fun was. The director spends 
the money. And it's harder to replace him. You can get rid of him, but it's a 
very expensive hobby. Getting rid of the writer is cheaper."</b> (Abraham 
Polonsky in 'If You Don't Get Kiled It's a Lucky Day' by Lee Server, published 
in </font><i><font size="2">The Big Book of Noir</font></i><font size="2">, ed. 
by Lee Server, Ed Gorman, Martin H. Greenberg, 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>Polonsky's  debut as a director, <span style="font-style: italic;">Force of Evil</span> (1948), is considered most 
overtly political of all the crime films of the 1940s. After completing his first 
directorial effort, Polonsky went to Europe to write a novel and acquire the screen 
rights for 
<a href="tmann.htm">Thomas Mann</a>´s short story <i>Mario and the Magician</i>, 
an allegorical tale of the power of fascism.  </p>
<p><i>Force of Evil</i> did not gain success in the United States, but it was hailed as a 
masterpiece in England, and enjoys nowadays a cult status. The film was based on Ira Wolfert's 
underworld novel <i>Tucker's People</i>. In the story a  lawyer, Joe Morse (John Garfield), 
has sold his expertise to Tucker (Roy Roberts), a gangster, who considers himself a 
businessman. "I wasn't strong enough to resist corruption, but I was strong 
enough to grab a piece of it," says Garfield's character to Beatrice Pearson, 
an idealistic young woman. Tucker runs an illegal lottery known as the "numbers 
racket". Joe finds that his boss has killed his brother Leo, who had his own 
lottery. "The analogy between the numbers racket and capitalism itself, with 
the reduction of human life to money and numbers, and the irresistible urge to 
monopoly, are there for all to see, reinforced by several location sequences in 
which the skyscrapers and steel bridges of New York dwarf the human dramas enacted 
below."<font size="2"> (from <i>The BFI Companion to Crime</i>, ed. by Phil 
Hardy, 1997).</font> Polonsky's "autopsy on capitalism" presented a 
merciless view of society, where rich get richer by exploiting the poor. After 
this work Polonsky did not direct again for twenty years. The influence of the film 
is seen among others in Martin Scorsese's <i>Mean Streets</i> (1973), in which 
Harvey Keitel's character struggles with a similar moral choice as Garfield. </p>


<p>Polonsky's third and most celebrated novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The World Above</span>, came out in 1951. The 
work follows psychologist Carl Myers as he learns, that outside the walls of the objective  
scientific  research  there are real people and their  problems. Polonsky´s film 
projects were stopped, when he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities 
Committee (HUAC).  The Illinois congressman Harold Velde called the director  
a "very dangerous citizen". "It was around by the time I did <i>Force of Evil</i>," 
said Polonsky later. "It was in the air. It was part of the cold war. The blacklist was already 
happening to people. It was inevitable that it was going to happen to me too unless I changed my 
position, which I wasn't about to do. So..."<font size="2"> (in '</font><font size="2">If You 
Don't Get Kiled It's a Lucky Day' by Lee Server) </font></p>
<p>Although blacklisted, Polonsky continued in film 
industry, writing TV scripts and doctoring screenplays. In the 1950s, he returned with 
his family to New York, where he wrote for CBS, among others episodes for <i>Danger</i> 
series, in which directors included Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer and Yul Brynner, and for 
<i>You Are There,</i> a dramatized documentary of such historical events as the trial of Joan of Arc, 
the death of John Dillinger, etc.  With Harry Belafonte and Robert 
Wise he made<span style="font-style: italic;"> Odds Against Tomorrow</span> (1959), based on <a href="mcgivern.htm">William P. McGivern</a>'s
novel. Polonsky wrote the script, having the author and civil-rights
activist John Oliver Killens ( (1916&#8211;1987) as a front, but it was not
until forty years later, when Polonsky was given public credit. In the
brutal crime story a plan to rob a bank fails due to racial hatred
between the three robbers. Robert Ryan played a racist ex-con,
Belafonte was a gambler, and David Burke a former policeman. The jazz
score was composed by John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet. </p>

<p>In the 1960s, Polonsky was story editor of the Canadian series <i>Seaway</i> (1964-65). Frank Rosenberg from Universal-International employed him first to write for <i>Kraft Suspense Theatre</i>, and then to co-write <span style="font-style: italic;">Madigan</span>
(1968) with Howard Rodman. This unpretentious police thriller, starring
Henry Fonda and Richard Widmark, was directed by Don Siegel, who had
been regarded as a B-movie director in the 1950s and 1960s, and who
went on to make <i> Dirty Harry</i> in 1971. Because the blacklist had
relaxed, Polonsky again used his own name in the credits. Also the cast
included an ex-blacklistee, the actor Lloyd Gough. Howard Rodman, using
the pseudonym Henri Simoun, had been blacklisted in the 1950s. </p>


<p>In 1970, Polonsky returned to Hollywood to make <span style="font-style: italic;">Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here</span>
(1970), nearly a quarter of a century after his directorial debut. The
film was based on Harry Lawton's novel about Indian turned cowboy, who
is pursued into desert after an accidental death. Polansky's third and
last directional work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Romance of a Horsethief&nbsp;</span>
(1971), was set in Poland at the turn of the century. Shot in
Yugoslavia, most of its technical staff did not speak English.
According to Polonsky, David Opatoshu who wrote the script <font face="Symbol">-</font> it was his first<font face="Symbol"> -</font>
was shocked, when learned that the director used accidents as a method
of filmmaking. The nostalgic Jewish drama ended up rather like <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>,
without the music. Polonsky himself enjoyed shooting abroad. Although
the film got mostly good reviews, people did not want to see it. "I was
very surprised that they didn't," the Polonsky said. </p>
<p>The following films, among them old projects like<i> Mario and the Magician</i> and <i>Childhood's End</i>, based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel, did not materialize. In the 1970s Polonsky worked with <span style="font-style: italic;">Avalanche Express</span>, adapted from Colin Forbes's thriller. In the early 1980s, he helped in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mommie Dearest</span>, based on Christina Crawford's memoirs, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man Who Lived at the Ritz</span> (1981), based on A.E. Hotchner's novel.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Monsignor</span>, from Jack Alain Léger's novel, is among Polonsky's last feature films as a co-screenwriter. <span style="font-style: italic;">Zenia's Way </span>partly drews from his childhood memories.&nbsp; Polonsky
received the Career Achievement Award of the Los Angeles Film Critics
Association in 1999. Polonsky died on October 26, 1999, in Beverly
Hills. </p>
