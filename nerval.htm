      <p>French writer and bohemian, one of the leading figures of
romantic movement. Also symbolists and surrealists found a kindred
spirit in Nerval, who described his dream states as "supernaturaliste".
The word first appeared in Nerval's translation of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.
Guillaume Apollinaire shortened the term to "sur-réaliste". Nerval believed that dream is a second life. <br>
 </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2">"Dream is a second life. I have
never been able to cross through those gates of ivory of horn which
separate us from the invisible world without a sense of dread."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Aurélia</font></i><font size="2">, 1855) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Gérard de Nerval was born Gérard Labrunie in Paris. His
father, Etienne Labrunie, was a doctor in Napoleon's army. Nerval's
mother, Marie-Antoinette-Marguerite Laurent, died in 1810 in Silesia.
Gérard's uncle, who lived at Valois at Mortefontaine, took care of him
for the next four years. Upon the return of his father, Nerval settled
in Paris. A taciturn figure, his father anyhow wanted him to follow in
his footsteps and study medicine. Although Nerval never became a
doctor, he helped his father in 1832 during a cholera epidemic. </p>
      <p>In 1822 Nerval entered the Collège Charlemange, where he met
the future poet and literature critic Théophile Gautier (1811-1872);
they became lifelong friends. Gautier was one of the most prominent
advocates of<i> l'art pour l'art</i> movement, born as a reaction
against bourgeois values. Nerval himself believed that poetry opens
doors to the invisible world, arguing that in similar way, "in sleep we
enter a new life, free of space and time". To astonish the bourgeois,
Nerval took sometimes his pet lobster for walks along the streets of
Paris. Gautier and Nerval lived in the rue du Doyenne. <br>
 </p>
      <p>Nerval's first poems, <i>Napoléon et la France guerrière</i>
and <i>Elégies nationales</i>, appeared in 1826-27. At the age of
twenty, Nerval published a translation of J.W. von Goethe's <i>Faust</i>
(1828), which the German author himself praised. The composer Hector
Berlioz used parts of the translation in his concert piece <i>La
Damnation de Faust</i>. On the eve of the première of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Symphonie Fantastique</span>,
Berlioz met the young Franz Liszt, and told him about Nerval's
translation. Litz shared Berlioz's ethusiasm, and decicated his own <span style="font-style: italic;">Faust-Symphony</span> to the French composer. Other German authors whom Nerval admired and
traslated were Heinrich Heine (1797-1856), who had lived in exile in
Paris since 1831, and E.T.A. Hoffmann (1776-1822), whose influence in
seen in Nerval's early collection of tales, <i>La main de gloire</i>
(1832). Heine's poems he translated for the<i> Revue des Deux Mondes</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Victor Hugo's play <i>Hernani</i> from 1829, about a noble
bandit, influenced deeply Nerval and other artists and writers of the
younger generation. Nerval had earlier adapted Hugo's <i>Han d'Islande</i>
(1826) for the stage and once ordered "sea-water" in a reataurant,
because that was Han of Iceland's favorite drink. </p>
      <p>Nerval's great love was the the second-class opera singer
Marguerite ('Jenny') Colon (1808-42), an actress at the <i>Opera-Comique</i>.
Frivolous but enchanting woman, she became, for her own surprise, one
of the muses of French Romanticism. Jenny was not a traditional beauty
but she played a central role in the operetta<i> Piquillo </i>(1837),
which Nerval co-authored with Alexandre Dumas <i>père</i> (1802-1970).
Nerval idolized her for four years, sent anonymous letters, founded her
a theatrical review, <i>Le Monde dramatique</i>, and praised her in
his writings. However, Jenny married the flutist Louis-Gabriel Leplus.</p>
      <p>Nerval's friends included <a href="/baudelai.htm">Charles
Baudelaire</a> (1821-1867), a much younger poet. Nerval was the
original dedicatee of Baudelaire's poem 'Un voyage à Cythère,' which
later became a part of <i>Fleurs du mal</i>. Baudelaire also
shared with Nerval a passion for Orient and hashish &#8211; they both attend
the meetings of the famous "Club des Hachischins", and wrote about the
drug. <i> </i>
The club, established by the early 1840s, held weekly
meetings in the Hotel Luzan in Ile St.-Louis. Along with Baudelaire,
and painters such as Eugène Delacroix, Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier,
and Paul Chenavard, he attended the meetings of the so-called "Club des
Haschischins". The club met regularly in the Hôtel Pimodan in Fernand
Boissard's room. <br>
 </p>
      <p>From 1832 Nerval was associated with a group of artist and
writers known as the<i> Jeune-France</i>. In 1834 Nerval inherited from
his grandfather a sizable sum of money, which enabled him to travel in
the south of France and Italy and found a short-lived theatre magazine,
      <i>Le Monde dramatique</i>. After the magazine went bankrupt,
Nerval turned to journalism due to his debts. He spent some months in
Vienna in 1839 on a mission for the Ministry of the Interior, but
eventually returned penniless to Paris, making part of the journey on
foot. Next year the Ministry of Education sent him to Belgium. </p>
      <p> Nerval traveled with Dumas in 1838 to Germany. They also
collaborated on two plays, <i>L'Alchimiste</i> (1839) and <i>Léo
Burckart </i>(1839), a failure. After the death of Jenny Colon in
1842, Nerval traveled to the Levant, returning in 1844 to Paris. </p>
      <p><i>Voyage en Orient</i> (1843-51), Nerval's account of the
journey, both inner and outer, is considered one of his best works. Edward
W. Said has noted, that while the German idea of Orient produced
lyrics, fantasies, and novels, the Anglo-French Orientalism was actual,
derived from political facts and domination. For a person who has never
seen the Orient, Nerval once said, a lotus is still a lotus; for me it
is only a kind of onion. In Cairo Nerval's travel companion bought a
slave girl &#8211; "This woman is costing us a fortune and we no longer know
what to do with her," he complained in a letter. <br>
</p>
      <p>Deeply in debt and trying to pay off his creditors, Nerval published
between 1851 and 1855 six volumes of prose in quick succession.<i> Lolery, souvenirs d'Allemagne</i> (1852) was based on
Nerval's journey to Germany in 1850.<i> Les Chimères</i> (1854) drew on
Egyptian and Greek mythology, Medieval legends, the <i>Tarot</i>, and
the<i> Kabbalah</i>. Its most famous sonnet, 'El Desdichado' (The
Disinherited), composed in a "state of supernaturalist reverie" as
Nerval himself said, has resisted all interpretation since its
publication in Alexandre Dumas's magazine<i> Le Mousquetaire</i>
(1853).&nbsp;  </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>I am the man of gloom &#8211; the widower
&#8211; the unconsoled</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">The prince of Aquitaine, his tower in ruins:</font><br>
        <font size="2">My sole </font><i><font size="2">star</font></i><font size="2"> is dead &#8211; and my constellated lute</font><br>
        <font size="2">Bears the </font><i><font size="2">Black Sun</font></i><font size="2"> of </font><i><font size="2">Melancholia</font></i><font size="2">.</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'El Desdichado', in </font><i><font size="2">The Chimeras</font></i><font size="2">, translated by Richard
Sieburth) </font></blockquote>
      
      <p>From the early 1840s to his death, Nerval suffered from
intermittent attacks of insanity; his first mental breakdown he had in
February 1841. Nerval spent in a hospital for nine months and wrote 'Le
Christ aux Oliviers' (Christ on the Mount of Olives). In the following
years, he was institutionalized several times, and once his
disappearance prompted a pseudo-obituary in the<i> Journal des Débats</i>. Gautier once remarked of his friend, "Gérard seemed to take pleasure in
disappearing from himself, in vanishing from his work, in leading his
readers astray." His contemporaries believed widely that he is incurably mad; for a long
period this was a hindrance to the criticism of Nerval's achievement. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Nerval was often treated at the clinic of Dr. Esprit Blanche, continued
later by his son, Dr. Emile Blanche, whose patients included Guy de
Maupassant in the 1890s. Until 1854, Nerval was in good terms with his
doctor although he was occasionally treated with cold baths or strapped
to straitjackets. "... I have suffered too greatly from a number of
remedies which I was unable to escape not to admire the methods of our
friend Emile, who limited himself to baths and two or three purgations
to deal with the illness that had struck me," he wrote in a letter to
his fellow patient at Passy. </p>

      <p><i>Les chimères</i>,
Nerval's most important collection of poems, was published together with the short story collection<i> Les filles du
feu</i> in 1854. His final work was the partly autobiographical <i>Aurélia</i>
(1855), written in lucid but hallucinatory prose. Its first instalment was published in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Revue de Paris</span>
with the indication, "to be continued in the nex issue". According to a
story, the conclusion of the text was found from Nerval's pockets after
his death. In <i>Sylvie</i>
(1853), a multilevel romance, the loss of real and ideal love centers
on three female characters. The images of love in <i>Aurélia</i> are
mostly related to the woman of the title, Jenny Colon's alter ego. The
narrator discovers the power of dreams and his faith in love is
restored after his descent into madness, the world beyond reason. </p>
      <p>Nerval committed suicide at the age of forty-six. In <i>Aurélia</i>,
his spiritual testament, Nerval said: "I said to myself: eternal night
is upon us, and the darkness will be frightful. What will happen when
they all realize there is no more sun?" Nerval's body was found on
January 26, 1855, hanging from a railing in the Rue de la Vielle
Lanterne, one of his favorite places in Paris.&nbsp; Nerval had said,
that his brain felt so softened that he had become incapable of
writing. For some decades, Nerval
fell into oblivion, until the novelist and critic Rémy de Gourmont
produced a new edition of his work in 1905. </p>
