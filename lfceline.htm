      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French writer and
physician, nihilist and anti-Semitist, a controversial figure, who
became famous with his first novel&nbsp;<em>Voyage au bout de la nuit</em>&nbsp;
(1932, Journey to the End of the Night). Céline was wounded severely in
World War I and respected as a national hero. After World War II he was
accused of collaborating with the Nazis and only his literary fame
saved him from imprisonment. </p>
      <blockquote> <font size="2"><b>"In this world we spent our time
killing or adoring, or both together. 'I hate you! I adore you!' We
keep going, we fuel and refuel, we pass on our life to a biped of the
next century, with frenzy, or any cost, as if it were the greatest of
pleasures to perpetuate ourselves, as if, when all's said and done, it
would make us immortal. One way or another, kissing is as indispensable
as scratching."</b></font> <font size="2">(from <i>Journey to the End
of Night</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Louis-Ferdinand Destouches (Louis-Ferdinand Céline) was born
in Courbevoie in the Seine Department. His father was employed by an
insurance company and mother dealt in quality lace. Céline grew in
Paris, where his mother set up a shop in the Passage Choiseul. Céline's
parents planned him a career in business and sent him abroad to learn
languages. He studied at a school at Diepholz in Lower Saxony, then at
an English boarding school, and worked in various commercial companies.
      </p>
      <p>In 1912, at the age of 18, he enlisted in a cavalry unit, the
Twelfth Regiment of the Cuirassiers. He was seriously wounded during
World War I in Ypres, which left him with a damaged arm, a buzzing and
ringing in his head, and headaches that lasted all his life. In the
autobiographical novel <i>North</i> (1960) he wrote about his ear
noises: "I listen to them become trombones, full orchestras, marshaling
yards..." He was awarded the Médaille militaire and a seventy-five
percent disability pension.</p>
      <p>Céline was then assigned to the French passport office in
London. In 1915 he married Suzanne Nebout, a Frenchwoman working as a
barmaid, but this union was not registered with the French consulate.
They divorced a years later, when he wen to the Cameroons, where he
worked for a lumber company. Upon contracting malaria and dysentery,
Céline was sent back to France. In 1919 he married Edith Follet, whose
father was a director of a medical
school. After studying medicine at the University of Rennes, Céline
received his degree from the University of Paris in 1924. His doctoral
thesis was entitled <span class="st"><em>La Vie et l'&#338;uvre de Philippe
Ignace Semmelweis</em></span>. This biographical study was about
Hungarian physician who discovered how to prevent childbed fever and
what was most important,&nbsp;Semmelweis introduced antiseptic
procedures into medicine. </p>
      <p>In 1925&nbsp;Céline left his practice, his wife, and his
daughter to work as a doctor for the League of Nations. He traveled for
three years in Switzerland,
the Cameroons, the United States, Cuba, and Canada. While in Detroit he
studied problems of social medicine at the Ford factories. In 1928 he
opened a private practice in a suburb of Paris and in 1931 he was
employed by a municipal clinic at Clichy, in Paris. Céline had an
affair with Cillie Pam, a gymnastics instructor; she was a Jew, married
and lived in Vienna. They met irregularly over the years. Eventually
Pam broke up with Céline, who wrote in 1939 in a letter, that
"[b]ecause of my anti-Semitic stance I've lost all my jobs (Clichy,
etc.) and I'm going to court on March 8. You see, Jews can persecute
too." </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><b>"Those who talk about the future are
scoundrels. It is the present that matters. To evoke one's posterity is
to make a speech to maggots." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Journey
to the End of the Night</font></i><font size="2">, 1932) </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While working in Clichy, Céline wrote his first ballets and
made his debut as a novelist with <i>Journey to the End of
the Night</i>, and assumed the pseudonym Céline &#8211; it was the Christian
name of his maternal grandmother. The book, which&nbsp;received the
Renaudot Prize,&nbsp;was praised both the right-wing extremist Léon
Daudet and Leon Trotsky, an exiled Communist leader. Ferdinand Bardamu,
the protagonist, had much in common with Céline. Narrated in the first
person in vernacular slang, the story covered author's life from 1913
to 1932, although the events are rearranged and modified for the tale.
Bardamu says he is an anarchist. His prayer of social vengeance is: "A
God who counts minutes and pennies, a desperate sensual God, who grunts
like a pig. A pig with golden wings, who falls and falls, always belly
side up, ready for caresses, that's him, our master. Come, kiss me." </p>
      <p>Céline follows Bardamu's adventures in the trenches of World
War I, his experiences in Africa running a trading post, hellish work
in a Ford factory in the United states, and his return to postwar
Paris, where he sets up a medical practice. At every turn of the
hallucinatory story, Bardamu encounters stupidity, suffering, and
cruelty. "It's sickening to see the workers bent over their machines,
intent on giving them all possible pleasure, calibrating bolts and more
bolts, instead of putting an end once and for all to this stench of
oil, this vapour that burns your throat and attacks your eardrums from
inside. It's not shame that makes them bow their head. You give in to
noise as you give in to war. At the machines you let yourself go with
three ideas that are wobbling about at the top of your head. And that's
the end." </p>
      <p>Céline's second
novel, <i>Death on the Installment Plan</i> (1936) also gained
critical success. Dropping the name Bardamu, it followed the story of
Ferdinand, but&nbsp;focused on his childhood, his violent father and
his mother, who suffered from polio and earned living for the family as
a saleswoman. "At the clinic where I work, the Linuty Foundation, I've
had a lot of complaints about the stories I tell..." Céline wrote.
Ferdinand leaves homes, and helps the inventor and hot air ballooner,
Courtial des Pereires, in his swindling plans. </p>
      <p>Much of his life, Céline spent traveling; as a prophet of
apocalypse, it was a political act for him, an escape from the modern
world. At the same time, Céline's travels provided him with new
perspectives. "The further away I go, the better," Bardamu says in <i>Journey
to the End of the Night</i>. </p>
      <p>Upon becoming a communist, Céline visited the Soviet Union. He
hoped in vain to have some of his ballets performed in Leningrad at the
Theater Marinski. In the first of his notorious pamphlets, <em>Mea
Culpa</em>, Céline declared his disenchantment with the Communist
system. He began to work on a third novel, but interrupted it because
he thought it was more urgent to try to prevent his country from
entering a new war &#8211; this conflict would be disastrous, Céline
believed. He produced anti-Semitic, pacifist pamphlets, two of which
were condemned by the courts. In <em><span class="st">Bagatelles pour
un massacre</span>
      </em>, a 118,000 word book, Céline argued, that there is an
international Jewish conspiracy to start a world war; all the evil in
the world is personified in the figure of the Jew. This work, in which
a physician tries to have his ballet performed by a professional dance
company, sold 75,000 copies by war's end. Although Céline's political
views had much in common with the Nazi propaganda, he claimed that
Hitler was a Jew. Once he interrupted a lecturer talking about
"Judeo-Marxist tyranny" with the remark "Hey, why don't you talk about
Aryan stupidity?" </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"Neptune has finally wed
Venus&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> even Gods can't screw around forever."</strong>
(from <i>Ballets without Music, without Dancers, without Anything</i>,
1959) <b>
        </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1936 Céline met the dancer Lucette Almanzor; she was 23 and
the author 41. <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i> had been
dedicated to another dancer, Elisabeth Craig. Lucette became his third
wife and faithfully stayed with her jealous husband through the hard
years after World War II until his death. Her memoirs, depicting the
marriage, appeared in 2001. At the outbreak of World War II, Céline
served as a volunteer doctor
on a French naval vessel, the <i>Shella</i>, which was sunk by a Nazi
submarine. After the fall of France in 1940, he worked in municipal
clinics in Satrouville and in a dispensary at Bezons. In 1943 he
published <em>Guignol's Band</em>, set in London's underworld during
the years of World War I, where the narrator witnesses the world
collapsing. </p>
      <p>To avoid avoid imprisonment, or death, during the Allied
liberation of France, he fled to Berlin with Lucette &#8211; he had met too
many times collaborationists and had formed too close ties with German
authorities. And on the BBC, Céline was denounced as a traitor. During
his stay in Germany he was arrested for a short time. In Sigmaringen,
where Céline found himself with Marshal Petain, members of the Vichy
Government and French collaborators, he treated refugees of the regime.
After journeying through bombed and devastated third Reich with his
wife and their constant companion, the cat Bébert , he settled in
Denmark, where he had deposited his savings. Céline was imprisoned over
a years in the Danish prison Vesterfangsel and others, because of
accusations of the Resistance, and finally released on the grounds of
ill health. He spent some years in exile at Korsør on the Baltic Sea. </p>
      <p>In Denmark, Céline was convicted in absentia by a civil court,
but in 1951 he was cleared and permitted to return to France. The
remaining decade of his life, Céline spent at Bellevue, on the
outskirts of Paris. Well aware that he was a literary outcast, Céline
continued to provoke his audiences. "Oh, many thanks! Many thanks! I'm
raging! Fuming! Panting! With hatred! Hypocrites! Jugheads! You can't
fool me!" <font size="2">(in the preface to the 1952 Gallimard edition
of <em>Journey</em>)</font> Gallimard, France's leading publishing
house, published in the 1950s such of his works as&nbsp; <em>Féerie
pour une autre fois</em> I-II (1952-54, Fable for Another Time), in
which the role of the ballet-dancer is to restore universal harmony,
and <span class="st"><em>D'un château l'autre</em></span> (1957,
Castle to Castle), a satire of the collaborators &#8211; Gallimard had
rejected Céline's (and Proust's) first submissions. </p>
      <p>The second part of <em>Fable for Another Day</em> took its
subject from the Allied bombing of a sorting station not far
from&nbsp;Céline's Montmartre apartment: "Blang! Kzeem! Kaboom! . . .
That's the truth of the Deluge! I've got nothing in my cellar! . . . so
I have no right . . . blamm and beboom! the sky may be torn open, that
doesn't make me any better, more respectable, less questionable, I've
still got no fucking business down there since there's nothing in my
cellar . . ."&nbsp;In the middle of the chaos, the narrator is worried
about&nbsp;the cat, "... damn it! I mean, that cat couldn't care less!"
Céline's later fiction was badly received. Soon after finishing the
novel <em>Rigardon</em>, he had a stroke. Céline died on July 1, 1961,
of a ruptured aneurysm. He was buried in a small cemetery at Bas
Meudon. </p>
      <p>Céline's reputation as an outstanding novelist has been
shadowed by his anti-Semitism and anti-Communism, although his
importance as an innovative author has been recognized. Andre Gide once
said: "It is not reality which Céline paints but the hallucinations
which reality provokes." Bardamu's conclusion was that people are
nothing but "packages of tepid, half-rotten viscera"; disease, loss,
and death are the basic elements of human life. Like <a href="rabela">Rabelais</a>,
he was a comic, a storyteller, fascinated by excess. In a short essay,
'Rabelais, il a raté son coup (1957)', he said: "I have had in my life
the same vice as Rabelais. I too have spent my time getting into
desperate situations." Céline often used in slang, which owed much to
the
Parisian poet Jehan Rictus (Gabriel Randon, 1867-1938). His attacks
against war, colonialism, and the nightmarish conditions of urban life
influenced such writers as Henry Miller, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and
William Burroughs. All of Céline's books
are more or less based on his own life. This is emphasized by the
first-person narrative and his own name &#8211; Ferdinand, Ferdine, Dr.
Destouches, Céline. In the post-war works the narrator is a
Louis-Ferdinand Céline / Dr. Louis Destouches, except in
      <i>Conversations with Professor Y</i>, which is a series of
imaginary interviews. His last three novels dealt with war. </p>
