<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Irish poet, dramatist and prose writer, one of the greatest English-language poets of the 20th century. Yeats 
received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. Between the Celtic visions of&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>The Wanderings of Oisin</em></span>&nbsp;(1889)
and the intellectual, often obscure poetry of the 1930s, Yeats produced
a tremendous amount of works. In his early career Yeats studied <a href="wblake.htm">William Blake</a>'s poems, 
<a href="sweden.htm">Emanuel Swedenborg</a>'s writings and other
visionaries. Later he expressed his disillusionment with the reality of
his native country. Central theme in Yeats's poems is Ireland, its
bitter history, folklore, and contemporary life.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Once out of nature I shall never take </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">My bodily form from any natural thing, </font><br>
<font size="2">But such a form as Grecian goldsmith make </font><br>
<font size="2">Of hammered gold and gold enamelling </font><br>

<font size="2">Or set upon a golden bough to sing </font><br>
<font size="2">To lords and ladies of Byzantium </font><br>
<font size="2">Of what is past, or passing, or to come. </font><br>
</b><font size="2">(in 'Sailing to Byzantium')</font><font size="2"></font></blockquote>

<p>William Butler Yeats was born in Dublin into an Irish Protestant family. His father, 
John Butler Yeats, a clergyman's son, was a lawyer turned to an 
Irish <a href="dgrosset.htm">Pre-Raphaelite</a> painter. Yeats's mother, Susan 
Pollexfen, came from a wealthy family <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the Pollexfens had a prosperous milling and shipping business. His
early years Yeats spent in London and Sligo, a beautiful county on the
west coast of Ireland, where his mother had grown and which he later
depicted in his poems. In 1881 the family returned to Dublin. While
studying at the Metropolitan School of Art, Yeats met there the poet,
dramatist, and painter George Russell (1867-1935), who&nbsp;was
interested in mysticism. His search inspired also Yeats, who at that
time associated Protestantism with materialism, and like Blake, he
rejected the Newtonian mechanistic worldview. This turn was a surprise
to his father, who had tried to raise his son without encouraging him
to ponder with such questions, but had given him Blake's poetry to
read. </p><p>Reincarnation,
communication with the dead, mediums, supernatural systems and Oriental
mysticism fascinated Yeats through his life. In 1886 he formed the
Dublin Lodge of the Hermetic Society and took the magical name <i>Daemon est Deus Inversus</i>. 
The occult order also attracted <a href="crowley.htm">Aleister Crowley</a>.
The Rhymers' Club, which Yeats founded with Ernest Rhys, he recalled it
meeting each night "in an upper room with a sanded floor in an ancient
eating-house in the Strand called the Cheshire Cheese". </p>

<p>As a writer Yeats made his debut in 1885, when he published his 
first poems in <i>The Dublin University Review</i>.
In 1887&nbsp;his family returned to Bedford Park, and Yeats devoted
himself to writing. He visited Mme Blavatsky, the famous occultist, and
joined the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society, but was later
asked to resign. In 1889 Yeats met his great love, Maud Gonne
(1866-1953), an actress and Irish revolutionary, whom he wrote many
poems. She married in 1903 Major John MacBride, and this episode
inspired Yeats's poem 'No Second Troy'. "Why, what could she have done
being what she is? / Was there another Troy for her to burn." MacBride
was later executed by the British. </p>
<p>Through Maud's influence Yeats joined the revolutionary organization
Irish Republican Brotherhood. Maud had devoted herself to political
struggle, but Yeats viewed with suspicion her world full of intrigues.
A police report described Yeats as "more or less revolutionary". He was
more interested in folktales as a part of an exploration of national
heritage and for the revival of Celtic identity. His study with George
Russell and Douglas Hyde of Irish legends and tales was published in
1888 under the name <i>Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish 
Peasantry</i>. Yeats assembled for children a less detailed version, Irish Fairy Tales (1892, see 
also <a href="wgrimm.htm">Wilhelm Grimm</a>). <span class="st"><em>The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems</em><strong> </strong></span>(1889), filled with sad longings, took its subject from Irish mythology. </p>

<p>In 1896 Yeats returned to live permanently in his home country. He
reformed Irish Literary Society, and then the National Literary Society
in Dublin, which aimed to promote the New Irish Library. Lady Gregory
first saw W.B. Yeats 1894 <font face="Symbol">-</font> "...looking every inch a poet," she wrote in her diary <font face="Symbol">-</font>
and again two years later. Their relationship started in 1897 and led
to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre, which became the Irish
National Theatre Society. It moved in 1904 into the new Abbey Theatre,
named after the Dublin street in which it stood. Yeats worked as a
director of the theatre, writing several plays for it. Another director
was the dramatist John Synge (1871-1909), Yeats's close friend, whose
masterpiece <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i>
(1907) was greeted with riots and had to be performed uder police
protection. Edmund Wilson once said, that Yeats's greatest contribution
to the theatre was not his own plays but those of Synge. </p>
<p>Yeats's most famous dramas were <em>Cathleen ni Houlihan</em> (1902), in which Maud Gonne gained great acclaim in the title role, and <em>The Land of Heart's Desire</em>
(1894). Yeats did not have in the beginning much confidence in Lady
Gregory's literary skills, but after seeing her translation of the
ancient Irish Cuchulain sagas he changed his mind. <i>Cathleen ni Houlihan</i> has been credited to Yeats but now it is considered to be written by Lady Gregory <font face="Symbol">-</font> the idea came from Yeats and he wrote the chant of the old woman at the end. <font size="2">('Lady Gregory's Toothbrush' by Colm Toibín, </font><i><font size="2">New York Times Review of Books</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">August 9, 2001</font><font size="2">) 

</font></p>
<p>Ezra Pound, whom Yeats met in 1912, served as his fencing master and 
secretary in the winters of 1913 and 1914. Pound introduced Yeats to 
Japanese <i>Noh </i>drama,
which inspired his plays. In early 1917 Yeats bought Thoor Ballyle, a
derelict Norman stone tower near Coole Park. After restoring it, the
tower became his summer home and central symbol in his later poetry. At
the age of 52, in 1917, he married Bertha Georgie Hyde Lees. Georgie,
who was 26 and came from a well-to-do family, was fluent in French,
German and Italian. Her father had died in 1909. She once confided to
Yeats, that her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were all
alcoholics. </p><p>
Although Yeats first had his doubts, the marriage was happy and they had a son and a daughter. 
However, before the marriage Yeats had proposed Maud Gonne, but he was also obsessed with Gonne's 
daughter Iseult, who turned him down. During their honeymoon, Yeats's wife demonstrated her gift 
for automatic writing. Their collaborative notebooks formed the basis of<em> A Vision</em>
(1925), about marriage, occultism, and historical cycles. Most readers
gave it a lukewarm reception. Gradually&nbsp;Georgie's role dwindled to
copyist, editor, housekeeper, and nurse, and by the early 1930s she was
too tired for sexual&nbsp;contact. </p>
<p>The change from suggestive, beautiful lyricism toward
disillusionment was marked in Yeats poem 'September 1913' in which he
stated: "Romantic Ireland's dead and gone." During the civil war Irish
Free State soldiers burned many of Yeats's letters to Maud Gonne when
they raided her house. In 1916 Yeats published 'Easter 1916' about the
Irish nationalist uprising. It referred to the executed leaders of the
uprising and stated: "Now and in time to be, / Wherever the green is
worn, / All changed, changed utterly: / A terrible beauty is born."
Although Irish politics was a central theme in many of Yeats's
writings, he made clear a distinction between political and religious
propaganda and art. At the start of the war, Yeats went to Oxford, but
then returned to Dublin. In 1922 he became a senator in the Irish Free
State. As a politician Yeats defended Protestant interests and took
pro-Treaty stance against Republicans. Maud Gonne's son, Sean MacBride,
was imprisoned without trial under emergency legislation that Yeats had
voted for. </p>
<p><em>The Wild Swans at Coole</em> (1917) was set on the Coole Park,
the estate of Yeats's friend and patron Lady Augusta Gregory. The tone
of the work is reflective, almost conversational, and occasionally the
poet lets loose his bitterness and grief of the past. Yeats registers
the death of Robert Gregory, Lady Gregory's son, and Mabel Beardley,
sister of the English artist Aubrey Beardsley. Yeats also returns to
his relationship with Maud Gonne, who had rejected his love. </p>
<p>In 1932 Yeats founded the Irish Academy of Letters. Never a
sophisticated political thinker, and favoring the leadership of the
few, Yeats was briefly involved in 1933-34 with the fascist Blueshirts
in Dublin and wrote some marching songs for them. In his final years
Yeats worked on the last version of <i>A Vision</i>, which attempted to present a theory of the 
archetypes of human personality, and published 
<em>The Oxford Book of Verse</em> (1936) and <em>New Poems</em> (1938). </p><p>After
finding breathing and walking difficult, Yeats tried to recover his
health in the south of France. At one point he said to&nbsp;his wife
that it was harder for him to live than to die. While staying at Cap
Martin he fell terribly ill. Yeats died in 1939 at the Hôtel Idéal
Séjour, in Menton, France. He was&nbsp; buried at Roquebrune. In 'Under
Ben Buiben,' one of his last poems, he had written: " No marble, no
conventional phrase; On limestone quarried near the spot / By his
command these words are cut: <i>Cast a cold eye / On life, on death. / Horseman; 
pass by!</i>" Yeats's 
coffin was taken in 1948 to Druncliff in Sligo, but there is some doubt as to the authenticity 
of the bones. "The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all 
that I write."</p>
