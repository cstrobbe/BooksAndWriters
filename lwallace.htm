<p>American novelist and a Civil War general, whose famous novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span>
(1880) contributed to the reinvigoration of the historical novel at the
end of the nineteenth century. Lew Wallace spent much of&nbsp; his life
as
a lawyer, soldier,
politician, and diplomat.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span>,
which took him seven years to write, has never been out of print since
its first publication. The screen
adaptation of the work from 1959, directed by William Wyler and
starring Charlton
Heston, won a record-breaking 11 Oscars.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1">"There is
an idea that war is the most noble occupation of men, and that the most
exalted greatness is the growth of battle-fields. Because the world has
adopted the idea, be not you deceived. That we must worship something
is a law which will continue as long as there is anything we cannot
understand. The prayer of the barbarian is a wail of fear addressed to
Strength, the only divine quality he can clearly conceive; hence his
faith in heroes</font><font size="-1"><b>." </b>(from <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span></font><font size="2"><font size="-1">)</font> </font></blockquote>
Lew
Wallace was born in Brookville, Indiana, the son of David Wallace,
a lawyer, and Esther
French Test Wallace, the third daughter of Congressman John Test. When
David Wallace, a member of the Indiana House of Representatives, was
elected as lieutenant governor of
Indiana in
1837, the family moved to Covington. <br>
<br>
Since
he was five years old, it was Wallace's noblest dream was to become
soldier
like his father, who had graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at
West
Point. Among young Lew's earliest memories was seeing the shining
bullet-buttons of the uniform his father wore as a Cadet.<br>
<br>
Wallace's mother
died of unknown causes in 1834. "And so I made&nbsp; acquaintance with
death," Wallace recalled in his autobiography. "I have seen it since in
many&nbsp; forms, at times under circumstances hideous because of&nbsp;
its accessories . . . but&nbsp; never realized its awful import, due,
as I can now perceive, to an intuitive perception of the extent of
the&nbsp; bereavement it so remorselessly inflicted on me." Two years
later his father married
Zerelda Gray Sanders, who was a suffragist and active in the temperance
movement. <br>
<br>
Wallace
attended briefly Wabash Preparatory School in Crawfordsville.
He was not a&nbsp; good student, but he loved to read, and remained a
voracious reader of history and historical fiction throughout his life.
Dropping out of
school at the age of sixteen, he became a newspaper reporter and at
nights
he studied law. To pursue adventure, he frequently interrupted his
practice. In 1846, Wallace left his studies to lead volunteers in
the
war with Mexico, but did not participate in combat. He was admitted
to the bar in 1849. Wallace never enjoyed being
an attorney; it was "the most detestable of human occupations," he
said. In 1856, he was
elected to the State Senate <br>
<br>
Wallace married in 1852 Susan Arnold Elston; they had one son. Susan
was a writer in her own right; two of her books were illustrated by
Wallace. While
living in Crawfordsville, he organized a militia unit called the
Montgomery Guards and outfitted his men in colorful uniforms in the
style of the Zouaves, a French Algerian army unit. During
the Civil War, he served at the battles of Fort Danielson and Shiloh,
where his dreams of military fame collapsed. Due to vague orders, his
division marched back and forth along the paths and arrived at Grant's
lines near Pittsburg Landing when the fighting was practically over.
Wallace, who was one of the youngest generals in the army, was accused
of incompetence. Later he commanded troops at Monocacy, slowing
Confederate General
Jubel Early's raid on Washington D.C. For the rest of his life, Wallace
tried to restore his military reputation. A theme of triumph over past
ran through<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ben-Hur</span>, too. <br>
<br>
Toward the end of war, Wallace went on an assignment to Mexico to help
Juárez oust the Emperor
Maximilian. His camp at the mouth of the Rio Grande was beset with an
epidemic of diarrhea. Back in Washington, he first served as the
second-ranking
officer on the commission that tried the conspirators involved in the
assassination of President Lincoln. The trial continued nearly two
months. During its progress Wallace employed himself sketching in
pencil the members of the commission, spectators, and the prisoners
themselves. He also acted as the president of martial board that tried
Henry Wirtz, commander of the notorious
Confederate prisoner-of-war camp at Andersonville, Georgia. <br>
<br>
Returning
to civilian life, Wallace re-entered law practice and
politics. He was appointed in 1878 Governor of the New Mexico
Territory, where he met the outlaw William Bonney (aka Billy
the Kid) after the Lincoln County War. Wallace was impressed by his
skills with firearms. He promised that if he
would testify before the grand jury and the trial court and convict the
murderer of Huston Chapman, an attorney, he will let Billy go
scott-free with a pardon in his pocked for all his misdeeds. However,
Wallace was not able to keep his part of the bargain. Billy took the
stand to name slayers of Chapman. <br>
<br>
In 1881, President James Garfield appointed
Wallace to the post of American minister to the Ottoman Empire. By
shaking Sultan Abdul Hamid II's hand at their first meeting, he
unknowingly defied the protocol, but made friends with the Sultan. The
despotic ruler, known later in history as the "Red Sultan" and "The
Great Assassin," carried out a series of massacres of the Armenian
population between 1884 and 1886. When the news reached American
shores, Wallace declared during a New England lecture tour that the
reports of the Turkish atrocities were exaggerated. Still
loyal to his friend, Wallace wrote in his autobiography, "... we can
readily believe that this uncontrolled master of fifty&nbsp; million
subjects has so kind and gentle a nature that he has never signed a
death-warrant." <br>
<br>
After settling again in Crawfordsville, Wallace
devoted to writing, politics, and lecturing. Wallace died on February
15, 1905, Crawfordsville. In addition to gaining fame as a writer,
Wallace held eight patents for various inventions, made and played his
own violins, and was a talented amateur artist. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span> became required reading in
literature classes across the United States. Until the publication of <i>Gone
With the Wind</i> (1936) by <a href="mmitchel.htm">Margaret Mitchell</a><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span>
remained the best-selling American novel. With the royalties, Wallace
built an luxury apartment building in Indianapolis, which he named
Blacherne after the Palace of Blachernae in Istanbul. <br>
<br>
Wallace's first novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Fair God</span>
(1873), was inspired by William Hickling Prescott's <span style="font-style: italic;">History of the Conquest of Mexico</span>
(1843). He had been indifferent to religion, but after meeting on a
train Robert Ingersoll, a prominent atheist, and having a discussion
with him, he decided to examine the nature and power of faith more
closely, but in the form of fiction. The result was <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span>. Set in the times of
Jesus, the novel traces the life of Judah Ben-Hur from
downfall to eventual redemption. Ben-Hur's friend, the Roman
Messala, accuses him of an attempt on the life of the Roman procurator
Valerius Gratus, and he is sent to the galleys for life. His mother and
sister are also
imprisoned. On the way to the coast in Nazareth, he is&nbsp; given a
cooling drink
by a stranger, who later turns out to be Jesus. Years later he returns
to Judea a free man and a Roman officer. In the chariot races in the
Circus at Antioch he wins Messala. He also rescues his mother and
sister. On the day of
the Crucifixion, he confronts the Christ and follows Him to Golgotha.
Recalling the occasion in Nazareth, he puts a sponge,
dipped into a vessel of wine and water and put on the end of a
stick, to the Christ's lips. At the end, Ben-Hur and his family embrace
the new
faith of Christianity. The story of the Three Wise Men is intertwined
in the plot. Wallace himself was not a member of any church or
denomination, or as he said, "Not that churches are objectionable to
me, but simply because my freedom is enjoyable, and I do not think
myself good enough to be a communicant." However, he was convinced that
Jesus was the person He claimed to be. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span>, which owes much
to <span style="font-style: italic;">The Count of Monte Christo</span>
by Alexandre Dumas, père, gained a great response, eventually selling
more copies than any other in the 19th century, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span>. Over 20 million
people saw&nbsp; the stage adaptation, which was performed continuously
on Broadway from 1899 to 1921, complete with live horses.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>The first staging featured later
film stars William Farnum and William S. Hart in the title role. <br>
<br>
Movie-makers
naturally seized early upon the work. Sidney Olcott's 1907 version was
billed as 'Sixteen Magnificent Scenes with Illustrated Titles,
Positively the Most Superb Motion-Picture Ever Made,' but was actually
composed of a few interior scenes and a chariot race. Fred Niblo's <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben-Hur</span>
(1925) contained impressive optical effects and outstanding miniature
work and mechanical effects. The gigantic sets were burned while
shooting
the Atlanta sequence in the film version of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Gone With the Wind</span>. William Wyler's
colossal remake of the silent classic <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>became
the only Hollywood production to make the Vatican's
official list of approved religious films. Its most famous
line, "Hate keeps a man alive," is not from the novel. M-G-M's first
choice for Ben-Hur was Paul Newman, who had portrayed a Greek slave in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Silver Chalice</span>
(1954). Concerned about his career image, Newman turned down the role,
saying "I'll never again wear a coctail dress in a movie." Miklos
Rozsa's vast musical canvas for the film brought the composer the Oscar
he admitted was "the one that I cherish the most." Several pieces of
the score were later adapted into hymns for use by church choirs. <br>

<br>
Wallace's final work,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Prince of
India</span>
(1893), dealt with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks,
seen from the perspective of the Wandering Jew. Wallace collected
material for the book during his stay in Turkey. In his official
position he had access to the Turkish archives and was able to verify
historical facts he wanted to use. All of Wallace's novels
are marked by their attention to historical detail. He also completed
two plays, <span style="font-style: italic;">Our English Cousin</span>
(aka The Blue and Gray) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Commodus</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>. <br>
