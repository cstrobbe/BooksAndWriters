      <p>Russian short story writer, novelist, autobiographer and
essayist, whose life was deeply interwoven with the tumultuous
revolutionary period of his own country. Gorky ended his long career as
the preeminent spokesman for culture under the Soviet regime of Joseph
Stalin. Gorky formulated the central principles of Socialist Realism,
which became doctrine in Soviet literature. The rough, socially
conscious naturalism of Gorky was described by Chekhov as "a destroyer
bound to destroy everything that deserved destruction." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The long files of dock labourers
carrying on their backs hundreds of tons of grain to fill the iron
bellies of the ships in order that they themselves might earn a few
pounds of this grain to fill their own stomachs, looked so droll that
they brought tears to one's eyes. The contrast between these tattered,
perspiring men, benumbed with weariness, turmoil and heat, and the
mighty machines glistening in the sun, the machines which these men had
made, and which, after all is said and done, were set in motion not by
steam, but by the blood and sinew of those who had created them &#8211; this
contrast constituted an entire poem of cruel irony."</b> (from
'Chelkash', 1895, translated by J. Fineberg) </font> </blockquote>
      <p>Aleksei Peshkov (Maksim Gorky, also written Maksim Gor'kii)
was born in Nizhnii Novgorod, the son of a journeyman upholster. Later
the ancient city was named 'Gorky' in his honour, and in Moscow one of
the leading thoroughfares was named Gorky Street. Gorky lost his
parents at an early age &#8211; his father died of cholera and his mother
died of tuberculosis. The scene of his mother, wailing and mourning
over her dead husband, opens his book of memoir, <i>My Childhood</i>:
"All her clothes were torn. Her hair, which was usually neatly combined
into place like a large gray hat, was scattered over her bare
shoulders, and hung over her face, and some of it, in the form of a
large plait, dangled about, touching Father's sleeping face. For all
the time I'd been standing in that room, not once did she so much as
look at me, but just went on combing Father's hair, choking with tears
and howling continually." </p>
      <p>Orphaned at the age of 11, he experienced the deprivations of
a poverty. The most important person in Gorky's life in those years was
his grandmother, whose fondness for literature and compassion for the
downtrodden influenced him deeply. Otherwise his relationships to his
family members were strained, even violent. Gorky stabbed his
stepfather, who regularly beat him. Gorky received little education but
he was endowed with an astonishing memory. He left home at the age of
12, and followed from one profession to another. On a Volga steamer, he
learned to read. In 1883 he was a worker in a biscuit factory, then a
porter, baker's boy, fruit seller, railway employee, clerk to an
advocate, and in 1891 an operative in a salt mill. Later Gorky used
later material from his wandering years in his books. In 1884 he failed
to enter Kazan University, and in the late 1880s he was arrested for
revolutionary activities. At the age of 19 he attempted suicide but
survived when the bullet missed his heart. </p>
      <p>After travels through Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the Crimea
Tiflis (late Tbilisi), Gorky published his first literary work, 'Makar
Chudra' (1892), a short story. 'Chelkash,' the story of a harbour
thief, gained an immediate success. He started to write for newspapers,
and his first book, the 3-volume <i>Sketches and Stories</i>
(1898-1899), established his reputation as a writer. Gorky wrote with
sympathy and optimism about the gypsies, hobos, and down-and-outs. He
also started to analyze more deeply the plight of these people in a
broad, social context. In these early stories Gorky skillfully mixed
romantic exoticism and realism. Occasionally he glorified the rebels
among his outcasts of Russian society. In his early writing career
Gorky became friends with <a href="tsehov.htm">Anton Chekhov</a>, <a href="ltolstoi.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, and Vladimir Lenin. Encouraged by
Chekhov, he composed his most famous play, <i>The Lower Depths</i>
(1902), which took much of the material from his stories of outcasts,
but did not have any single predominant figure. It was performed at the
Moscow Art Theater under the direction of Konstantin Stanislavsky. <i>The
Lower Depths</i> enjoyed a huge success, and was soon played in Western
Europe and the United States. </p>
      <p>Gorky was literary editor of <i>Zhizn</i> from 1899 and
editor of Znanie publishing house in St. Petersburg from 1900. <i>Foma
Gordeyev</i> (1899), his first novel, dealt with the new merchat class
in Russia. The short story <i>Dvadsat' shest' i odna</i><i> </i>(1899,
Twenty-Six Men and a Girl) was about lost illusions, a theme which
Gorky explored in a number of subsequent tales. "There were twenty-six
of us &#8211; twenty-six living machines locked in a damp basement where,
from dawn to dusk, we kneaded dough for making into biscuits and
pretzels. The window of our basement looked out onto a ditch dug in
front of them and lined with brick that was green from damp; the
windows were covered outside in fine wire netting and sunlight could
not reach us through the flour-covered panes. Our boss had put the wire
netting there so we could not give hand-outs of his bread to beggars or
those comrades of ours who were without work and starving." <font size="2">(from 'Twenty-Six Men and a Girl', 1899)</font> The joy in
the lives of the bakers is the 16-year old Tania, who works in the same
building. A handsome ex-soldier, one of the master bakers, boasts of
his success with women. He is challenged to seduce Tania. When Tania
succumbs, she is mocked by the men, who have lost the only bright spot
in the darkness. Tania curses them and walks away, and is never again
seen in the basement.</p>
      <p>Known as a writer with a mission, Gorky was put under close
watch in his hometown. He became involved in a secret printing press
and was
temporarily exiled to Arzamas, central Russia in 1902. In the same year
he was elected to the Russian Academy, but election was declared
invalid by the government and several members of the Academy resigned
in protest.
Because of his political activism, Gorky was constantly in trouble with
the tsarists authorities. He joined the Social Democratic party's left
wing, headed by Lenin. <br>
      </p>
      <p>To
raise money to Russian revolutionaries, Gorky
went to the United States in 1906. However, he was compelled to leave
his hotel, not because of his political opinions, but because he
traveled with Mlle. Andreieva, with whom he was not legally married. At
that time, he had not obtained divorce from his first wife, Ekaterina
Pavlovna, with whom he had two children. The American author Mark Twain
expressed his support to Gorky at a dinner party, saying, "My
sympathies are with the Russian revolution, of course." In his reply,
Gorky spoke of the importance of financial assistance to the
revolution, that was not over. While staying on Staten Island at the home of John Martin, a rich
Fabian socialist, he learned that his five-year-old daughter had died
in Russia. <br>
</p>
      <p>During his ill-fated mission to raise funds for the
Bolshevik cause, Gorky
wrote in the Adirondack Mountains greater part of his classic novel, <i>The
Mother</i>,
which came out in 1906-1907. The novel was first published in English
and later translated into Russian. Its heroine, Pelageia Nilovna,
adopts the cause of socialism in a religious spirit after her son's
arrest as a political activist. Pelageia's husband is a drunkard and
her only consolation is her religious faith. Pelageia's husband dies,
and her son Pavel changes from a thug to socialist role model and
starts to bring his revolutionary friends to the house. Pavel is
arrested on May day for carrying a forbidden banner. While continuing
to believe in Christ's words, she joins revolutionaries, and is
betrayed by a police spy. Gorky based her character on a real person,
Anna Zalomova, who had travelled the country distributing revolutionary
pamphlets after her son had been arrested during a demonstration. The
novel, considered the pioneer of socialist realism, was later
dramatized by Bertolt Brecht. Vsevolod Pudovkin's film from 1926
largely contributed to the popularity of the novel. 
      </p>

      <p>After helping the main organizer of a worker's march to
escape
from Russia, Gorky found himself once again in jail. He also had to
leave Russia, going to Finland and then to Germany. In 1906 Gorky
settled in Capri, where he stayed until 1913 when the Russian Duma
passed an amnesty act to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Romanov
dynasty. With Anatoly Lunacharsky and Alexander Bogdanov, a prominent
Bolshevik philosopher, he founded in Capri a "Party school" which was
to train "permanent cadres of Party leaders from working class". Gorky
lectured in the history of Russian literature. Lenin strongly opposed
the school and established his own in Paris. At that time Gorky was
more close to Bogdanov, who advocated the revision Marxism along the
lines of a "religion of socialism," than Lenin, who ridiculed
Bogdanov's theories. <br>
</p>
      <p>Lenin visited his villa in
1908, he fished there and played chess, becoming childishly angry when
he lost a game to Bogdanov. Gorky was disgusted by Lenin's smug Marxism and after
reading only a few pages from his book <i>Materialism and
Empirio-Criticism</i> he threw it on the wall. In the controversial
novel <i>The Confession</i> (1908), which rapidly fell after the
Revolution into relative obscurity, Gorky coined the term
"God-building," by which he combined religion with Marxism. </p>

      
      <p>In 1913 Gorky returned to Russia, and helped to found the
first Workers' and Peasants' University, the Petrograd Theater, and the
World Literature Publishing House. The first part of his acclaimed
autobiographical trilogy, <i>My Childhood</i> (1913-14),
was followed by <i>In
the World</i> (1916), and <i>My Universities</i> (1922), which was
written in a different style. In these works the author looked through
the observant eyes of Alyosha Peshkov his development and life in a
Volga River town. When the war broke out, Gorky ridiculed the
enthusiastic atmosphere and broke off all relations with his adopted
son, Zinovy Peshkov, who joined the army. <br>
      </p>
      <p>First the author also rejected Lenin's hard-line policy,
defending the Petrograd intelligentsia. "Lenin's power arrests and
imprisons everyone who does not share his ideas, as the Romanovs' power
used to do," he wrote in November of 1917. After Russian revolution
Gorky
enjoyed protected status, although in 1918 his protests against
Bolsheviks dictatorial methods were silenced by Lenin's order. Gorky's
memoir of Lev Tolstoy (1919) painted nearly a merciless portrait of the
great writer. </p>
      <p>When Anna Akhmatova's former husband Nikolai Gumilyov was
arrested in 1921, Gorky rushed to Moscow to ask Lenin for a pardon for
his old friend. However, Gumilyov had been shot without trial.</p>
      <p>Dissatisfaction with the communist regime and its treatment of
intellectuals lead to his voluntary exile
during the 1920s. Lenin had also recommended, that recommended that he
would feel better abroad. "To an old man any place that's warm is
homeland,"
Gorky once wrote. He spent three years at various German and Czech
spas,
and was editor of <i>Dialogue</i> in Berlin (1923-25). <br>
      </p>
      <p>On Capri in the
1920s Gorky wrote his best novel, <i>The Artamov Business</i> (1925),
dealing with three generations of a pre-revolutionary merchant family.
Gorky's essay 'V.I.Lenin' was written immediately after Lenin's death.
The author expressed his great admiration for the Revolution leader and
gave a lively account of their discussions in Paris and Capri. "You're
an enigma," he once said to me with a chuckle. "You seem to be a good
realist in literature, but a romantic where people are concerned. You
think everybody is a victim of history, don't you? We know history and
we say to the sacrificial victims; 'overthrow the altars, shatter the
temples, and drive the gods out!' Yet you would like to convince me
that a militant party of the working class is obliged to make the
intellectuals comfortable, first and foremost." </p>
      <p>In 1924-25 Gorky lived in Sorrento, but persuaded by Stalin,
he returned in 1931 to Russia, where he settled in Moscow with his
wife. As a sign of Gorky's literary stature, the new Soviet leader renamed the writer's hometown Nizhnii Novgorod in honor of
the author. Gorky founded a number of journals and
became head of the Writers' Union &#8211; his photograph in the congress hall
was nearly as large as Stalin's. Gorky's speech at The First Congress
of Soviet Writers in 1935 established the doctrine of socialist
realism. </p>
      <p>Although Gorky criticized the bureaucracy of the Writers'
Union, but nothing changed. All the proposals of the congress were very
soon buried when the Great Terror started. Writers were shot and Stalin
showed personal interest in the activities of writers. Gorky's actions
and statements before and after his return to Russia are controversial.
When the poet Anna Akhmatova and many writers asked Gorky to help
Nikolai Gumilev, a celebrated poet and Akhmatova's first husband, Gorky
apparently did nothing to save him from execution. Gorky's son Maxim, a
reputed communist, died in 1934, presumably from pneumonia. A potential
danger to the Stalinist regime, Gorky himself was denied permission to
leave the Soviet Union. His final novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Life of Klim Samgin</span>, about an intellectual, who wavers between his own ambition and political commitment.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Gorky died suddenly of pneumonia in his country home, <i>dacha</i>,
near Moscow on June 18, 1936. In some source the cause of death was
said to be heart desease. The author was buried in the Red Square and
Stalin started earnest his Show Trials. Rumors have lived ever since
that he may have been assassinated on Joseph Stalin orders. Genrikh
Yagoda, Stalin's secret police chief during the great purges of
1936-38, made a "confession" at his own trial in 1938, that he had
ordered Gorky's death. According to another rumor, Gorky had been
administered 'heart stimulants in large quantities', and the ultimate
culprits were 'Rightists and Trotskyites'. The murder of Gorky's son in
1934 was seen as an attempt to break the father. However, when the KGB
literary archives were opened in the 1990s, not much evidence was found
to support the wildest theories. Stalin visited the writer twice during
his last illness. The most probable conclusion is that Gorky's death
was natural. </p>
      <p>As an essayist Gorky dealt with wide range of subjects. His
underlying theme is a passionate humanistic message and political
commitment
to bolshevism. In <i>Notes on the Bourgeois Mentality</i> he accuses
the
bourgeoisie of self-absorption and concern only with its own comfort. <i>On
the Russian Peasantry</i> sees peasants as resistant to the
new social order. <i>City of the Yellow Devil</i>, written in New
York, condemns American capitalism. On the other hand, Gorky early
opposed Bolsheviks, criticizing their use of violence against their
fellow men. Among Gorky's important essays are biographical sketches of
such writers as Tolstoy, Leonid Andreev and Anton Chechov.</p>
