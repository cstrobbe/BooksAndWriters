<P>English prose writer, the younger sister of poet <A href="wordswor.htm">William Wordsworth</A>, famous for her diaries and 'recollections'. Several of Dorothy Wordsworth's own poems or notes in her journal were included in various editions of her brother's poetical works. She published nothing during her lifetime, and spent the last twenty-five years struggling against physical and mental illness. E. de S&eacute;lincourt, who published her journals in 1933, has called her "probably... the most distinguished of English writers who never wrote a line for the general public." </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"She did not cultivate the graces which preside over the person and its carriage. But, on the other hand, she was a person of very remarkable endowments intellectually... Her knowledge of literature was irregular, and thoroughly unsystematic. She was content to be ignorant of many things; but what she knew and had really mastered lay where it could not be disturbed - in the temple of her own most fervid heart."</B> (Thomas De Quincey in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Reminiscenes of the Lake Poets</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1961) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dorothy Wordsworth was born in Cockermouth, Cumberland. She was the third of five children. Her childhood Dorothy spent with various relatives. Ann Cookson of Penrith, her mother, died when Dorothy was six. "I know," she later wrote, "that I received much good that I can trace back to her". Dorothy's father, John Wordsworth, an attorney, died when she was just twelve. He died intestate, his affairs in chaos, and Dorothy was removed from boarding-school. At the age of 15 she went to her grandparents in Penrith and met her brothers again. However, she was not to see much of them before she was 23. From 17 to 22 she lived at Forncett Rectory, Norfolk, where her mother's brother, William Cookson, took her in. She enjoyed her life in Norfolk more than at her grandmother's house. She read, wrote, and improved herself in French. After the winter of 1793/4 she continued to stay in various other places. </P>
<P>Wordsworth began writing in about 1795 when she shared a house in Dorset with her brother. At Alfoxden, Somerset, she became friends with the poet <A href="coleridg.htm">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</A>, and traveled with him and William in Germany (1798-99), where they lived in lodgings in Goslar. William and Dorothy stayed in the Hartz Mountains for five months. F.W. Bateson has suggested in <I>Wordsworth: A Re-interpretion</I> (1954)<FONT size=2><I> </I></FONT>that William tried to repress his intense feelings toward his sister in Lucy poems, which he wrote during this time. Coleridge spent a good deal of time at the University city of G&ouml;ttingen. For the journey she bought a notebook, which she used for her daily affairs. It contained among others things lists of the clothes, from shirts and nightcaps to fur items, that she would need in the cold winter, and also list of groceries – bread, milk, sugar, and rum. In Alfoxden she started her first journal, and then kept several other journals of travels and expeditions. Her thoughts and writings were an important source of stimulation for Coleridge and William. "Tho we were three persons," Coleridge wrote, "it was but one soul." Sarah Coleridge's role in this artistic circle was not central – she was considered dull, but she raised the children and took care of her opium-addicted husband, who eventually abandoned his patient wife. </P>
<P>With her brother Dorothy occasionally played a curious game – they lay down next to each other outdoors, pretending to be in their graves. Some biographers have speculated about their strong attraction to each other, considering it sexual. William's poems, such as 'Lines' and 'To My Sister', don't give any hint of this, but do express his happiness, when she accompanies him on the walking trips: "My sister! ('tis a wish of mine) / Now that our morning meal is done, / Make haste, your morning task resign; / Come forth and feel the sun." <FONT size=2>(from 'To My Sister') </FONT></P>
<P>In 1799 Dorothy settled with her brother in Dove Cottage, Grasmere, in the Lake District. It was her first real home since her mother died. In 1802 William married Mary Hutchinson, who was Dorothy's best friend. The marriage was happy but Dorothy was too hysterical to attend the wedding. A few days before the marriage she wrote to her friend: "I have long loved Mary Hutchinson as a Sister, and she is equally attached to me this being so, you will guess that I look forward with perfect happiness to the Connection between us, but happy, as I am, I half dread that concentration of all tender feelings, past, present, and future will come up me on the wedding morning." </P>
<P>When<A href="quincey.htm"> Thomas De Quincey</A> met William at Grasmere in 1807, he also made the acquaintance of Dorothy. In the household also lived Mrs. Wordsworth, two children, and at that time one servant. According to De Quincey, Dorothy's face was of Egyptian brown, "rarely, in a woman of English birth, had I seen a more determinate gypsy tan. Her eyes were not soft, as Mrs. Wordsworth's, nor were they fierce or bold; but they were wild and startling, and hurried in their motion." Quincey was impressed by the Lake District: its small fields, miniature meadows, and solitude. Dorothy's influence on William was, according to Quincey, the way she "humanized him by the gentler charities". Dorothy remained in Grasmere, the Lake District, until 1813, when she moved to nearby Rydal. In 1829 she became ill and was obliged to lead the life of an invalid. From 1835 she developed arteriosclerosis and for the remaining 20 years she suffered from mental problems, possibly originating in thiamin deficiency. She often played with a bowl of soapsuds and hid from visitors. Dorothy Wordsworth died in Rydal Mount on January 25, 1855. </P>
<P>Dorothy Wordsworth started to keep her journal in the late 1790s, recording walks, visits, conversations, and above all the world of nature. The journals were not intended for publication. Suppressing her ambitions of becoming a writer, and devoting herself to domestic duty, she once said: "I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an author." Instead she wrote to "give Wm Pleasure by it". Her brother's poems, such as 'Beggars' and 'Daffodils', use her precise descriptions of the countryside and life in Dove Cottage. Dorothy's <EM>Alfoxden Journal 1798</EM> and <EM>Grasmere Journals</EM> (1800-03) were published posthumously. The first notebook of the Grasmere Journal was not empty&nbsp;– it also contained lists and accounts of her stay in Goslar. Among her other works are <EM>Journal of the visit to Hamburg and journey to Goslar</EM> (1798), the memoir&nbsp;<SPAN class=st><EM>Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, A. D. 1803&nbsp;</EM></SPAN> (1804),&nbsp; <EM>An Excursion on the Banks of Ullswater</EM> (1805), <EM>Journal of a Tour on the Continent</EM>&nbsp;(1820), which included her irritated views of William on their journey in Switzerland, <EM>Excursion up Scafell Pike</EM>&nbsp; (1818), and&nbsp; <EM>Journal of a Tour in the Isle of Man</EM> <B></B>(1828). </P>
