<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English film director, who greatly
contributed to the medium's growth as an art. Hitchcock's career as a
director spanned over 50 years, beginning from the technically
innovative silent films of the 1920s to <em>Psycho </em>(1960), an avant-garde horror film, and ending with the old-fashioned thriller&nbsp;<em>Family Plot </em>(1976).
When Alfred Hitchcock received the American Film Institute's Lifetime
Achievement Award in 1979, he dedicated it to his wife Alma Reville, "a
film editor, a script writer, the mother of his daughter and a talented
cook." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Subjective treatment, putting the
audience in the mind of the character, is, to me, the purest form of
the cinema. I suppose Rear Window is the best example of it."</b> (Hitchcock in </font><i><font size="2">Who the Devil Made It </font></i><font size="2">by Peter Bogdanovich, 1997) </font></blockquote>
<p>Alfred Hitchcock was born in London, the son of William Hitchcock, a
poultry dealer and fruit importer, and Emma Jane Hitchcock (née
Whelan). He was educated at a Jesuit school, London's St. Ignatius
College, and the School of Engineering and Navigation, where he studied
mechanics, electricity, acoustics, and navigation. He then worked for a
telegraph company and took art courses at the University of London. In
1920 he entered the film industry as designer of titles for Hollywood's
Famous Players-Lasky (Paramount). </p><p>When the Famous Players
studios was taken over by a British production company, Hitchcock
became an assistant director, working also as screenwriter and art
director in several films. His first assignment as a director came in
1925. Next year he married Alma Reville, a film editor and script girl,
who would later collaborate with him in several films. In 1926
Hitchcock directed <em>The Lodger</em>, which was commercially
successful. It also marked his debut as an extra. The trademark of
Hitchcock's personal appearances continued in later productions. In
1929 he directed<em> Blackmail</em>, the first British feature film with synchronous sound. </p>
<p>Hitchcock made his international breakthrough in 1934 with <em>The Man Who Knew Too Much</em>. The next film, <em>The 39 Steps</em>,
was an even greater success, and one of the earliest Hitchcock's
examples of the "innocent man on the run." Before leaving England, he
made <em>The Secret Agent </em>(1936), <em>Sabotage&nbsp;</em> (1937), <em>Young and Innocent </em>(1937), <em>The Lady Vanishes </em>(1938), and <em>Jamaica Inn </em>(1939). </p>
<p><a href="buchan.htm">John Buchan</a>'s spy thriller<i> The Thirty Nine Steps</i> was published in 1915. Buchan was one of Hitchcock's favorite writers and many consider<i> The Thirty-nine Steps</i>
Hitchcock's best British film. However, Graham Greene considered the
story "inexcusably spoilt" by the director. The&nbsp;story begins with
the assassination of a secret agent. Richard Hannay (Robert Donat), the
hero, bumps into a beautiful woman who calls herself 'Miss Smith'. She
asks Hannay if he has ever heard of "the 39 Steps," and claims she must
go to Scotland the next day to stop some vital secrets falling into
enemy hands. Miss Smith is murdered and Hannay becomes the prime
suspect for her murder. Hannay is hunted by the police and captured. He
manages to escape, and continues his run with a blonde, Pamela
(Madeleine Carroll). In the end the secret of the 39 Steps is
revealed&nbsp;&#8211; it is an organization of spies collecting information
on behalf of a foreign government. Hannay spends a good portion of the
film handcuffed to Pamela, which has been interpreted as Hitchcock's
bondage fantasy or a criticism of the institution of marriage. <i>The Thirty-nine Steps</i> was remade with Keith More as Hannay in 1956 and in 1978 by Don Sharp, starring Robert Powell.</p>
<p>Hitchcock's first American movie, <em>Rebecca</em> (1940), won the Best Picture Academy Award. However, the critic in <i>Variety </i>(March
27, 1940) gave it a bad review. "Dave Selznick's picture is too tragic
and deeply psychological to hit the fancy of wide audience appeal...
General audiences will tab it as a long-drawn out drama that could have
been told better in less footage." The film was based on <a href="dumaurie.htm">Daphne du Maurier</a>'s novel, which drew mostly from Charlotte Brontë's classic <i>Jane Eyre</i>. In the 1940s Hitchcock also directed among other films <em>Shadow of Doubt </em>(1943), starring Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten, <em>Spellbound&nbsp;</em> (1945), which won an Academy Award for Best Music for Miklós Rózsa, <em>Notorious </em>(1946), starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and <em>Rope</em>
(1948), shot in a series of eight-minute continuous takes. It was the
director's first color movie&nbsp;&#8211; he had to re-shoot more than half
of the film after he noticed that the color of the setting sun appeared
too vulgar on film. Hitchcock had also used in <em>Lifeboat</em>
(1944) limited cinematic space&nbsp;&#8211; the film was shot in a gigantic
water tank with back projections. He once said: "It is possible to be
cinematic in the confined space of the telephone booth." <i>Rope </i>consisted of only eleven shots; usually Hitchcock's films contained one thousand shots. </p>
<p>In the 1950s Hitchcock made some of his most acclaimed films, <em>Strangers on a Train </em>(1951), <em>Vertigo</em> (1958), and <em>North by Northwest</em> (1959)&nbsp;&#8211; all of them dealt with psychically more or less disturbed people, anticipating <em>Psycho</em>
(1960). Hitchcock himself suffered from all kinds of fears&nbsp;&#8211; he
was frightened of police, authorities, his own emotions, and sex. Many
of his films feature spies, "people who are not what they seem." </p><p>In <em>Rear Window</em>
(1954) James Stewart played a sympathetic Peeping Tom, Jeff, a
photographer and an alter ego of Hitchcock, a professional voyeur as a
director. Stewart has a broken leg; he spends his time at home watching
his neighbours, and his nurse Stella says: "We've become a race of
Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is to get outside their own house
and look in for a change." <i>Vertigo</i>, Hitchcock's most ingenious
film, was dismissed by several critics. "... it pursues its theme of
false identity with such plodding persistence that, by the time the
climactic cat is let out of the bag, the audience has long since had
kittens..."<font size="2"> (Arthur Knight in</font><i><font size="2"> Saturday Review</font></i><font size="2">, June 7, 1958)</font> </p><p><i>Rear Window</i>,
starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly, was treated coldly in the New
Yorker: "What isn't understandable... is Alfred Hitchcock's association
with this enterprise... I fear that Rear Window must be taken as
another example of his footless ambition to make a movie that stands
absolutely still... Maybe one of these days he's going to bust out the
way he used to, and then we'll have some satisfactory films." (John
McCarten, August 7, 1954) In the United States Hitchcock produced a TV
series <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> (1955-62) and <i>The Alfred Hitchcock Hour </i>(1962-1965). Several book anthologies, juvenile series <i>Alfred Hitchcock and The Three Investigators</i> (based on characters created by Robert Arthur), and a monthly mystery magazine, <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine</i>, also used Hitchcock's name as part of the title. </p>
<p><i>Psycho</i> was based on Robert Bloch's novel about Norman Bates
(Anthony Perkins), proprietor of Norman Bates motel, who keeps the
preserved corpse of his mother in his cellar. Marion Crane (Janet
Leigh) has stolen $40,000 from her employer and after having driven for
almost a day and a half, she decides to stay for the night at the
motel. Dressed as an old lady, his mother, Norman kills Marion, when
she takes a shower. The scene is among the most famous in film history.
Hitchcock later told Francois Truffaut that the suddenness of the
murder, out of the blue&nbsp;&#8211; only one-third of the way through the
Bloch novel&nbsp;&#8211; did not hold him back from making the film in the
first place. Norman also kills Milton Arbogast, a private detective,
who is on the trail of the money. Marion's sister Lila and Sam Loomis
eventually reveal Norman's secret. <br>
</p>
      <p>The composer Bernard Herrman provided for<span style="font-style: italic;"> Psycho</span> an unforgettable score, as he had done in <span style="font-style: italic;">North by Northwest</span>.
The overture was described by the composer as "a kaleidoscope
orchestral fandango designed to kick off the exciting rout which
follows." Hitchcock himself once said that "The basis of the cinema's
appeal is emotional. Music's appeal is to a great extent emotional,
too. To neglect music, I think, is to surrender, willfully or not, a
chance of progress in filmmaking."&nbsp;  </p>
<p>In 1998 <em>Psycho</em> was listed as one of the American Film
Institute's top 100 films of the century (number 18). Some critics
realized that Hitchcock had made a hit, but others not, among them
Moira Walsh in <i>America</i> (July 9, 1960): "Hitchcock seems to have
been more interested in shocking his audience with the bloodiest
bathtub murder in screen history, and in photographing Janet Leigh in
various stages of undress, than in observing the ordinary rules of good
film construction. This is a dangerous corner for a gifted movie maker
to place himself in." </p>
<p>Hitchcock's <em>The Birds</em> (1963) was basically a monster film, but instead of a "creature from the Black Lagoon"<strong>&nbsp;</strong>it
featured ordinary birds.&nbsp;Hitchcock tormented the star, Tippi
Hedren, with live birds&nbsp;and hand-puppets&nbsp;for a week, to get
an emotional reaction from her. He first had spotted Hedren in a
commercial for Sergo, a diet drink. In <em>Marnie&nbsp; </em>(1964),
he allegedly made advances to her. In the film she played a compulsive
thief who also happens to be frigid. A key scene in this
work&nbsp;involves a marital rape. "Blondes are the best victims.
They're like virgin snow which shows up the bloody footprints." <font size="2">(Hitchcock in </font><i><font size="2">Sunday Times</font></i><font size="2">, 1 September 1973, from </font><i><font size="2">Dictionary of Film Quotations</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Tony Crawley, 1994)</font> <em>Torn Curtain </em>(1966),
starring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews, is perhaps best known for its
long murder scene. Newman tries to kill an East German named Gromek, a
police spy who refuses to die&nbsp;&#8211; he is battered, stabbed, nearly
strangled and finally Newman manages to kill him by holding Gromek's
head inside a gas oven.</p><p>The political thriller <em>Topaz</em>&nbsp;(1969)
was slightly delayed when André Malraux, the French Minister of
Culture, withdrew the crew's shooting permit as he felt the film was
anti-French. In the 1970s Hitchcock continued with <em>Frenzy </em>(1971), which marked the only time the director&nbsp;shot a nude scene (<i>Psycho</i> not included) and <em>Family Plot </em>(1976),
which was his last production. In 1979 Hitchcock received the American
Film Institute's Life Achievement Award. In the last years Hitchcock's
drinking had increased. His famous unrealized final project was <i>The Short Night</i>,
set partly in Finland. The writer David Freeman had prepared the script
and Catherine Deneuve had agreed to star in it. The film director Peter
Bogdanovich offered to shoot all the Finland sequences from a
storyboard prepared with Hitchcock. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Practically all of Hitchcock's dramatic
ideas were visual. If a cameraman is supposed to 'paint with light,'
Hitchcock painted with moving camera."</b> (Jack Cardiff, in </font><i><font size="2">Hitchcock's Notebooks </font></i><font size="2">by Dan Auiler, 1999)</font> </blockquote>
<p>Several of Hitchcock's film were based on novels, short stories or
plays by writers such as Daphne du Maurier, John Steinbeck, John
Galsworthy, Leon Uris, Victor Canning, Robert Bloch, W. Somerset
Maugham, Joseph Conrad, Josephine Tey, John Buchan, Cornell Woolrich,
Patricia Highsmith and Winston Graham. Central themes are the thin line
between sanity and insanity, the random nature of events, the concept
of shared guilt, and how an innocent man's world can be destroyed by
crime. Characteristic of his plots is the MacGuffin, the catalyst that
sets the drama in motion, but which is at the same time something
totally irrelevant. It can be a secret plan, or the uncovering of a spy
ring as in <i>The Thirty-nine Steps</i>, or uranium, as in <i>Notorious</i>. </p>
