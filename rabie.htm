<P>One of Africa's most important French-language poets, a prominent figure in the literary revival known as the <I>Mitady ny Very</I>, which swept Madagascar in the 1930s. Rab&#233;arivelo wrote both in Malagasy and in his own unique version of imperfect French. He was passionate and restless, drifted from one job to another, and suffered from drug addiction and depression. Rab&#233;arivelo took his own life at the age of 36. </P>

<P>Jean-Joseph Rab&#233;arivelo was born in Antananarivo (Tananarive), the capital of Madagascar, into a relatively poor family. His mother, who married a tailor, was an aristocrat, related to the royalty of the largest Malagasy ethnic group, the Merina people. In 1895 Malagasy armed forces had been defeated by the French, and the new administration led to the pauperization of most of the Merina royalty. The loss of her family's property was also partly caused by the abolition of slavery. </P>
<P>Rab&#233;arivelo was educated by his uncle, who sent him to the Ecole des Fr&#233;res des Ecoles Chr&#233;tiennes at Andohalo, then to the Coll&#233;ge Saint-Michel in Amparibe. He left school at the age of thirteen, but continued to read widely, gaining familiarity with Western classics, and mastering both Spanish and French. For some years he was a secretary and interpreter of the head of the Canton of Ambatolampy, and then returned to Tananarive. Until 1923 Rab&#233;arivelo worked in odd jobs, and eventually ended as a proof-reader at the printing press of the Imerina, keeping the poorly paid job until his death. In 1926 he married Mary Razafitrimo, a photographer's daughter; they had five children. The death of his youngest daughter was a terrible blow for him. In <I>Un conte de la nuit</I>, a short story, Rab&#233;arivelo recounts the family tragedy. </P>
<P>Rab&#233;arivelo's mother encouraged him to write and at the age of 20 Rab&#233;arivelo published his first poems in a journal. In 1923 the international revue <I>Anthropos </I>accepted an article of his on the poetry of Madagascar. He started to contribute articles to journals in his own country, in the neighboring Mauritius, and in Europe. Among his friends was the poet Pierre Camo, who worked as a civil servant, and included some of Rab&#233;arivelo's  poems in his review <I>18&#176; Latitude Sud</I>. Rab&#233;arivelo's early poems were influenced by 19th-century French Symbolist poets. </P>
<P> In 1931  Rab&#233;arivelo was accepted into the Acad&#233;mie 
malgache, founded after the model of Acad&#233;mie fran&#231;aise. However, he never got the higher-paid job, which he 
always hoped for, from the administration The oppressive colonial rule set the boundaries to Rab&#233;arivelo's work more or less visibly. 
Several nationally prominent writers had been imprisoned in the 1910s, Malagasy-language writing was restricted, but memories of 
independence were still fresh. A recurring theme Rab&#233;arivelo's collections was exile, the journey 
away from the native land, referring to the loss of independence. When all texts written in French were considered to belong 
to French literature, Rab&#233;arivelo supported bilingual works and proposed that &quot;Malagasy literature&quot; would recognize 
French-language texts composed by the Malagasy. To underline his point about the dual nature of the colonial culture, he 
wore Westernstyle clothes under his  traditional long robe. </P>
<P>In the 1930s Rab&#233;arivelo  launched his own journal,<I> Capricorne</I>. Like <A HREF="baudelai.htm">Baudelaire</A>, one of his heroes, Rab&#233;arivelo was too much of an  unpractical dreamer to join the cadres of militant poets, although many of his friends opposed French rule. Rab&#233;arivelo's own private goal was to get to France, to be assimilated into  a whole greater culture.  He also produced several translations of French poems. The dream never realized. Sharing Baudelaire's disgust of mediocre life, Rab&#233;arivelo replaced the reality of a colonized civilization with his own images, and  created a new mythical world, shadowed by visions of suffering and death. This cosmos, which was populated by wandering tribes and bodies in perpetual mutation, was full of bitter-sweet beauty. </P>
<P><I>La Coupe de cendres</I> (1924), his first collection of poems, was followed by <I>Sylves</I> (1927), which included 'Nobles d&#233;dains', 'Fleurs m&#234;l&#233;es', 'Destin&#233;e', 'Dixains', and 'Sonnets et po&#232;mes d'Iarive'. The third collection, <I>Volumes</I> (1928), included 'Vers le bonheur', 'La guirlande &#224; l'amiti&#233;', 'Interlude rythmique', 'Sept quatrains', 'Arbres', 'Au soleil estival', ' and 'Coeur et ciel d'Iarive'. </P>
<P>Rab&#233;arivelo's plays, <I>Imaitsoanala, Fille d'oiseau</I> (1935) and <I>Aux portes de la ville</I> (1936), focused on rituals and folklore and carefully avoided any reference to politically inflammable issues. On the other hand, none of his critical works were published in his lifetime. Rab&#233;arivelo's love poems, a translation from traditional Malagasy poetic form known as <I>hain teny</I>, were collected in <I>Vieilles chansons des pays d'Imerina</I> (1974, Old Songs of the Merina Country). His compatriot Flavien Ranaivo also drew from this resource of dialogue  poetry, which proceeds as a test of the lovers' commitment. </P>
<P>Rab&#233;arivelo committed suicide on June 22, 1937, by poisoning himself. <I>Vieilles chansons de pays Imerina</I> (1939), a collection of love poems, appeared posthumously. Various reasons have been given for his suicide, including the colonial administration's decision to send a group of basket-weavers instead of him to France to represent the colony. It was also known that he had a melancholic temperament and was addicted to drugs. </P>

<P>Several of Rab&#233;arivelo's poems was published  in <A HREF="senghor.htm">L&#233;opold Senghor</A>'s famous  <I>Anthologie de la nouvelle po&#233;sie n&#232;gre et malgache</I> (1948), the seminal anthology embodying the aspirations of the Negritude movement. An English translation of some of Rab&#233;arivelo works,<I> 24 Songs</I>, came out in 1963. <I>Translations from the Night, </I>edited by John Reed and Clive Wake, was issued by Heinemann a few years later. Gerald Moore and Ulli Beier called Rab&#233;arivelo &quot;a poet of genius&quot; in  <I>Modern Poetry from Africa</I> (1963). </P>
