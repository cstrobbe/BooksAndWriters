      <p>Russian revolutionary, the only woman member of Lenin's
Central Committee, a career diplomat, who advocated in her writings the
emancipation of women. As a number of other Russian revolutionaries,
Kollontai spent many years abroad, before returning to St. Petersburg
following the February 1917 Revolution. Kollontay has often been called
- in some respect misleadingly - a propagator of "free love".
In her famous collections of stories, <i>Liubov' pchel trudovykh</i>
(1923, Love of Worker Bees) and <i>Zhenshchina na perelome </i>(1923,
A Great Love), Kollontai dealt with women's sexuality, their
self-consciousness, and political activism. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The habitual morality of the
present day man permits him to demand a young girl that she remain a
virgin until legitimate marriage; but there were tribes among whom the
woman, on the contrary, made it a matter of pride to have many lovers,
decorating her arms and legs with rings to indicate their number."</b>
(from </font><font size="2">'Communism and the Family', 1920) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Alexandra Mikhailovna Kollontai was born into an aristocratic
family on March 31 [March 19, old style], 1872, in St. Petersburg.
Kollontai's father, Mikhail Domontovich, was a general in the Imperial
Russian Army. Alexandra (Masalin-Mravinsky) Domontovich, her mother,
was the daughter of a Finnish wood merchant and dairyman. From her
previous marriage, she had three children. </p>
      <p>Kollontai was brought up largely by servants and tutored at
home. In the summer, her family moved to her grandfather's estate in
Kuusa, at the Isthmus of Karelia in Finland. Kollontai educated herself
through reading. In Finland, then part of Russia, Kollontai became
acquainted with the life tenant farmers and farm laborers. Later as an
agitator and political economist, she was considered the expert on the
"Finnish question." </p>
      <p>For a teaching certificate, Kollontai was tutored in
literature by Viktor Ostrogorskii. In 1893 she married her cousin
Vladimir Ludvigovich Kollontai, who was an army officer. The marriage
was a disappointment, she felt trapped at home and did not have
enough time for her writing. However, for five years, unti the age of
twenty-six, she lived the life of a dutiful wife, bringing up their
son. During an inspection of a large textile factory, Kollontai found a
dead small boy in a crowded tenement house. The shock marked a turning
point in her life and made her a revolutionary. </p>
      <p>In 1898 Kollontai abandoned her conventional marriage to study
political economy in Zurich. She had already read Marx and Lenin, but
in Zurich she familiarized herself with the views of Karl Kautsky and
Rosa Luxemburg. Before returning to St. Petersburg in 1899, she met in
London Sidney and Beatrice Webb, whose reformist thoughts she rejected.
Kollontai's first article, dealing with the relationship between the
development of children and their surroundings, was published in the
Marxist journal <i>Obrazovaniie</i> in 1898. In her&nbsp;piece dealing
with Finland, published in <i>Novoye vremia</i>, she used the
pseyudonym Elin Molin. Kollontai contributed also to the German journal
      <i>Sociale Praxis</i>. </p>
      <p>Kollontai's <i>Zhizn' finliandskikh rabochikh</i>, which took
three years to write, was an investigation of the living and working
conditions of the Finnish proletariat in relation to industry. The book
appeared in 1903 in St. Petersburg. It attracted much attention among
revolutionary circles and established her fame as a noteworthy Marxist
political economist. On January 3, 1905, she joined the workers'
procession to Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, which ended in Bloody
Sunday massacre&nbsp;&#8211; Czar's imperial guards killed some130
demonstrators. In 1906 she published a collection of articles on
Finland and Socialism. Accused of calling for an armed revolt against
the government, she was forced to flee to Germany to avoid arrest. From
1908, she lived in exile, touring Europe and making speeches. Fluent in
several languages, she became internationally known agitator of the
German Social Democratic Party. </p>
      <p>In 1914 Kollontai joined the Bolsheviks, the radical faction
of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, which had been
established by Lenin. Due to her revolutionary activities, she was
briefly imprisoned in Germany and Sweden, from where she was expelled.
From 1915 Kollontai started to assist Lenin, they had met first time in
1905. An ardent pacifist, she toured in the United States, making
speeches against participation in World War I. "Charming russian
socialist countess talked on Europe and effect of the world war," wrote
the <i>Erie Evening Herald</i>. In <i>Indiana Daily Times</i>
Kollontai was called an "Exiled Princess."</p>
      <p>Kollontai served in 1917 as an intermediary delivering German
money to Lenin, when the Germans arranged his return to Russia. On the
eve of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Kollontai was in Norway in her
rented a villa in Holmenkollen. She returned to St. Petersburg in
March. A few months later she was arrested along with <a href="trotsky.htm">Lev Trotsky</a> and Lev Kamenev by the Kerenskii
government. Kollontai was released on bail, paid by the writer Maxim
Gorky among others. In June she was a Russian delegate to the 9th
Congress of the Finnish Social Democratic Party </p>
      <p>Kollontai became the first woman elected to the Party Central
Committee. After the October<b> </b>Revolution, when Lenin and the
Bolsheviks seized power, she was appointed People's Commissar for
Public Welfare. In the Ministry she was welcomed with a strike, as the
other Commissars. "Immediately the poor of the great cities, the
inmates of institutions, were plunged in miserable want: delegations of
starving cripples, of orphans with blue, pinched faces, besieged the
building. With tears streaming down her face, Kollontai arrested the
strikers until they should deliver the keys of the office and the safe;
when she got the keys, however, it was discovered that the former
Minister, Countess Panina, had gone off with all the funds, which she
refused to surrender except on the order of the Constituent Assembly." <font size="2">(<a href="johnreed.htm">John Reed</a> in </font><i><font size="2">Ten Days that Shook the World</font></i><font size="2">,
1919) </font></p>
      <p>Kollontai was very popular but controversial figure.<b> </b>In
her high office she advocated the simplification of marriage and
divorce procedures, improved the position of illegitimate children, and
campaigned for various reforms in domesctic life. With Inessa Armand
and Nadezhda Krupskaia she was one of the founding members of Women's
Section of the Communist Party. Kollontai's decision to turn the
Alexander Nevsky Monastery into a sanctuary for war invalids sparked
fury among the religious followers of the old regime. </p>
      <p>In the early 1920s&nbsp;Kollontai served as vice-president of
the International Women's Secretariat of the Communist
International. Disillusioned with Lenin's unorthodox New Economic
Policy (NEP), which permitted some private activity in agriculture,
trade and light industry<b>,</b> Kollontai took a leading role with
Alexander Shliapnikov in the libertarian Workers' Opposition. The group
within the party demanded greater democracy and wanted to transfer more
power to trade-union organizations, not to the State. After the group
was banned in 1921, many adherents were arrested and later killed. </p>
      <p>Women's sexual liberation, which was one of Kollontai's main
programs, roused the disapproval of working-class women, who felt that
they have already enough troubles without weakening family ties. Her
theory of non-possessive love, formed in the essay 'Dorogu krylatomu
Erosu' (Make way for the Winged Eros), was disapproved by Lenin. "The
sexual act must be seen not as something shameful and sinful but as
something which is as natural as the other needs of heathly organism,
such as hunger and thirst, " Kollontai wrote in the political pamphlet
'Theses on Communist Morality in the Sphere of Marital Relations',
published in 1921. Lenin noted to Klara Zetkin, the German Communist
leader and feminist, that "this glass of water theory has made our
young people mad, quite mad." </p>
      <p>By her political opponents Kollontai was unfairly accused of
preaching sexual promiscuity and her writings were condemned as
bourgeois Western feminism. She was also accused of neglecting her
duties because of a love affair and threatened with expulsion from the
party. A nonconformist, Kollontai herself had lived as she wrote: in
1918 she married Pavel Dybenko, the handsome leader of the Baltic Fleet
sailors;<b> </b>they separated in 1922, but she also had a long love
affair with Alexander Shliapnikov, a metal worker and Bolshevik
activist twelve years her junior. </p>
      <p>Kollontai combined Marxism with an ultra-Bolshevist sexual
morality. She rejected the "bourgeois" feminism of her day, insisting
that the achievement of socialism was a necessary condition of women's
emancipation and true social equality between the sexes.<b> </b>The
family appeared in this theory as remnant of capitalist society. "In
place of the old relationship between men and women, a new one is
developing," Kollontai wrote in 'Communism and the Family' (1920), "a
union of affection and comradeship, a union of two equal members of
communist society, both of them free, both of them independent and both
of them workers. No more domestic bondage for women. No more inequality
within the family." </p>
      <p>In the end of the novella 'Red Love,' the heroine leaves her
lover, Vladimir, by whom she is pregnant. "I don't need a man," she
says to his friend, and assures her that she will not have an abortion.
"The organization will bring it up. We&#8217;ll fix up a nursery. And I&#8217;ll
bring you over to work there. You like children, too. Then it&#8217;ll be our
baby. We&#8217;ll have it in common." Kollontai's novella 'Bol'shaia liubov''
from <i>A Great Love</i> has been read as a <i>roman à clef</i> of
the triangle drama of Lenin, his wife Nadezhda Krupskaia, and Inessa
Armand in Paris. Their relationship was kept secret in the Soviet
Union, but the book was reprinted in 1927. Also Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn's <i>Lenin in Zurich</i> (1975) was a novelisation of the
same subject. However, Solzhenitsyn used real names. </p>
      <p>After a brief stint in 1922 in Ukraine as Commissar of
Propaganda and Agitation, Kollontai continued as a diplomat. Lenin had
cut all contacts to Kollontai. Her political career as a Commissar was
over &#8211; she had resigned in 1918 on the ground of total disagreement
with the current policy, the ratification of the Treaty of
Brest-Litovsk included. Moreover, Stalin did not regard her as an
useful ally in his maneuvers and Lenin himself was seriously ill in the
spring of 1922. Although Lenin warned that Stalin, his close
collaborator, should not be allowed to be appointed secretary-general
of the Communist Party, he could not stop Stalin's rise to the top.</p>
      <p>Kollontai
was first assigned to the post of Minister to Norway
(1923-26). After one year in Mexico, where the altitude of Mexico City
irritated her chronic angina, she returned to Norway. During the stay,
she organized exhibitions, made a number of friends within the
Mexican intellectusal and cultural community, and developed an
appreciation for Mexico's traditional an modern art. Kollontai was
especially fond of the works of Diego Rivera. Due to the hostility of
the United States directed against both the Mexican government and her,
Kollontai's position became increasingly difficult. Moreover, the
embassy had been involved in an illegal strike. The <i>New York Times</i> 
wrote that the Central Labor Organization of the Federal District had requested that
President Elías Calles pronounce Kollonti personan non grata and expel
her from the country immediately. From 1930 Kollontai was a diplomat in
Sweden, becoming eventually in 1943 the world's first woman ambassador.
Elegant and refined, she enjoyed at diplomatic gatherings the
reputation of being the best-dressed woman in the Soviet Union. In 1933
she received the Order of Lenin for organizational work with women. </p>
      <p>During this period, Kollontai lived virtually in exile. Her <i>Autobiography
of a Sexually Emancipated Woman</i>, which appeared first in Germany in
1927, remained unpublisehd in Russia. Pavel Dubenko and Alexander
Shlyapnikov died in the purges of the 1930s. Between 1934 and 1939
Stalin liquidated 70 % of the members of the central committee. By the
end of WW II, Kollontai was one of the few leaders of the first
Bolshevik government, who did not perish in the mass purges. In her
book of memoir, <i>Jumala syöksee enkelinsä</i> (1972), Aino Kuusinen
tells that Stalin planned to call Kollontai, whom he considered a
traitor, back to Russia during the purge of the thirties. Kuusinen
herself would be appointed ambassador to Sweden and Norway. Insted
Kuusinen herself was held in prison camps over fifteen years. Aino
Kuusinen was married to <a href="kuusin.htm">Otto Wilhelm Kuusinen</a>,
a member of the Politburo. </p>
      <p>In January 1940, during the Russo-Finnish War of 1939-40 (the
Winter War), the Finnish left-wing playwright Hella Wuolijoki contacted
her old friend, Kollontai, asking her to act as an intermediary of
peace between the countries. Kollontai sympathy for Finland was
well-known, and she had urged the Finns to seek independence<b> </b>in
1917.<b> </b>Kollontai was also aware that the Soviet invasion, which
had started the war, was widely condemned in the West. Thus Kollontai,
who was capable of to act on her own initiative, was not afraid to send
an inquiry to her goverment. The hostilities ended in March in the
Treaty of Moscow, but a year later the Finns attacked Russia.
Kollontai's contacts were again needed. She had a prominent role in
1944 in the armistice negotiations that concluded the Continuation War.
      </p>
      <p>Kollontai returned to the Soviet Union in 1945. She was
nominated in 1946 for the Nobel Peace Prize. Behind the nomination were
Finland's Prime Minister J.K. Paasikivi and other members of the
government. The Kremlin was unhappy when the prize went to the American
religious leader and J.R. Mott and Emily Greene Balch, an economist and
social reformist. But an even greater disappointment was was felt by
Stalin, who failed to in 1948. As a result, Stalin established the
International Stalin Prize for Streghteninf Peace among Peoples. </p>
      <p>Her last years Kollontai spent in Moscow, writing her memoirs,
keeping a diary, and serving as an adviser to the Russian Foreign
Ministry. Avoiding the terrible features of Stalin's era, most of
Kollontai's writing focused on her life before the Octover Revolution.
After the war her book of memoir, <i>And Dreams Came True</i>, was
published in Finnish and Swedish. In the Soviet Union her memoirs were
reprinted several times. Aino Kuusinen met Kollontai again in 1947. At
that time Kollontai had to use wheelchair. She looked depressed and
worried over her ration card. However, to the very end, she remained
faithful to Marxism-Leninism and loyal to Stalin. Kollontai died of
cardiac infarct in Moscow on 9 March, 1952. </p>
