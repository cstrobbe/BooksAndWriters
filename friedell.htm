<p>Austrian essayist, cabaret performer, and amateur cultural
historian, best known for his brilliant, playful,&nbsp;and stimulating
magnum opus, <i>A Cultural History of the Modern Age</i> (1927-31),
written under the influence of Oswald Spengler and Jacob Burckhardt.
Friedell hoped for a rebirth of Western culture; the Moder Age, which
was born from the<span class="st"> Great Plague of the fourteenth century, has come to its end</span>.
At the eve of World War II,&nbsp;Friedell committed suicide by jumping
from a window of his apartment. The German writer Thomas Mann ranked
Friedell as one of the greatest stylists of the German language. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"The bioscope is killing human gesticulation, as sound film is killing the human voice&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong>
and the same is true of the radio; at the sometime, it is freeing us of
the necessity of concentration, and we are now able to enjoy Mozart and
sauerkraut, or the Sunday sermon and a game of cards, at one and the
same time."</strong> (from <i>A Cultural History of the Modern Age</i>, vol. 3, 1931) </font>
</blockquote>
      <p>Egon Friedell was born Egon Friedmann in Vienna, the youngest
son of Moriz Friedman, a Jewish cloth manufacturer and Karoline
(Eisenberger) Friedmann. Friedell lost both of his parents in his
childhood. Shortly after his birth, his mother deserted her family and
ran away with a voice instructor. Formally his parents divorced in
1887. Moriz Friedmann died in 1891, after which Friedell's relatives
took care of him, first his aunt, who lived in Frankfurt am Main.
Friedell's mother reappeared in 1928, demanding support from him. She
died in 1933. Friedell's brother Oskar Friedmann established in 1899
the first exclusively literary publisher in Vienna, the Wiener Verlag,
which attracted writers such as Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur
Schnitzler, and Robert Musil. Later it was taken over by a businessman
named Fritz Freund. <br>
 </p>
<p>His studies Friedell did not take very seriously. In 1894 he was
dismissed from&nbsp;a secondary&nbsp; school in Frankfurt and it was
not until 1899 when he passed his final school-leaving examination
(Abitur) at the Gymnasium in Heidelberg. A few years earlier he had
renounced the Jewish faith and converted to Protestantism. Before
entering the University of Heidelberg, he studied philosophy at the
university of Berlin. </p><p>From 1900 until his death,
Friedell&nbsp;had the same third-floor residence in the Gentzgasse,
sharing it with his housekeeper Hermine Schimann and her daughter
Herma. Friedell never married and it was&nbsp; rumored that he was
homosexual or impotent and that Herma was his child.&nbsp;After she
married a carpenter named Franz Kotab, the couple and later their two
children continued to live in a small room in his barchelor apartment.
Friedell named Hermine Schimann as his sole heir. </p>
<p>At the turn of the century, majority of the liberal, intellectual
elite of Vienna was Jewish, and like Friedell, many of them changed
their religion. However, in Vienna, as Arthur Schnitzler remarked, "it
was impossible, especially not for a Jew in public life, to ignore the
fact that he was a Jew." Sigmund Freud, whom Friedell criticized for
bolstering irrationalism with tools of rationalism, never hid his
strong Jewish identity. Friedell's attitude toward Freud was
ambivalent.&nbsp; Psychoanalysis had according to Friedell all the
characteristics of a religious sect, but on the other hand Friedell
acknowledged Freud's achievement in revealing the significance of the
unconscious. <b></b></p>
<p><b></b>Friedell studied German literature and philosophy&nbsp;in
Heidelberg&nbsp;under the philosopher and historian of philosophy Kuno
Fischer, and completed his studies in Vienna, receiving his doctorate
&nbsp;in 1904. His dissertation about Georg Christoph Lichtenberg
(1742-1799) was rejected, but the following attempt, dealing with
Novalis' universal science and dedicated to Kuno Fischer, was finally
accepted although declared poor. <i>Novalis als Philosoph</i> was printed under the name Fri(e)dell, but officially Friedell 
changed his name in 1916. </p>
<p>Forced to abandon his hopes for an academic career, Friedell took a new turn in his life and became a cabaretist.<strong> </strong>He contributed to Karl Kraus's <em>Die Fackel</em> and<strong> </strong>then he was appointed artistic director of the Vienna cabaret Fledermaus, 
named 
after Johann Stauss' operetta. His plays, written in collaboration with Alfred Polgar, 
included 
<i>Goethe</i> (1908), in which he&nbsp;acted in the&nbsp;title role, 
<i>Der Petroleumkönig; oder, Donauzauber</i> (1908), and 
<i>Soldatenleben im Freden</i> (1910)
. The first wife of the architecht Adolf &nbsp;Loos, writer and actress
Lina Loos&nbsp; (Carolina Catherina Obertimpfler)&nbsp;was involved in
the cabaret, too.&nbsp;Lina, to whom he unsuccessfully proposed
marriage,&nbsp;was the great love of his life.&nbsp; Arthur
Schnitzler's based his play <em>Das Wort</em>
(The Word) on a true love story between Lina and a young man, who&nbsp;
committed&nbsp; suicide&nbsp;after being&nbsp;spurned by her. </p><p>Friedell, Peter Alternberg, and Polgár were the stars of the literary circle at Café 
Central. Friedell also wrote a study on Peter Altenberg, <i>Ecce Poeta</i> (1912), and edited a 
collection of writings, <i>Das Altenbergbuch</i>
(1922). Viennese coffeehouses, the meeting places of intellectuals,
were laboratories of new ideas. All epoch-making personalities knew
each other in this unique world of grand cafés, where professors,
writers, musicians, and artists freely argued at tables, enjoying at
the same time a cup of coffee and perhaps a strudel. Friedell's other
friends included nearly all the major authors of the period, Franz
Werfel, Hermann Broch, Robert Musil, Rainer Maria Rilke, Arthur
Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal. To advertise his lectures 'Shaw oder
die Ironic' and 'Besser als Shakespeare' Friedell used in
posters&nbsp;Egon Schiele's face&nbsp;from&nbsp;<em>Self-Portrait Nude, Facing Front</em>
(1910); this violently coloured watercolor portraying a
figure&nbsp;convulsed in a spasm became&nbsp;one&nbsp;of the&nbsp;icons
of the avant-garde circles of Vienna. </p><span class="st"></span><p>Due
to his alcohol problems and depression, Friedell spent some time in a
sanatorium near Munich. He also suffered from diabetes. <span class="st">In spite of his bohemian appearance,&nbsp;Friedell was reluctant to see any changes in his daily routines.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span>The
outbreak of WW I was greeted all over Europe with joy and celebration.
Like a numbrer of writers, Friedell volunteered for military service.
However, he was rejected for physical reasons. Later he defended
Germany's role in the war in his&nbsp;<em>Cultural History of the Modern Age</em> by comparing it&nbsp;with the&nbsp;fate of the Nibelungs. <br>
</p>
<p>From 1924 Friedell cooperated with Max Reinhardt and acted in his
productions at the Vienna Burgtheater and in Berlin at the Deutschen
Theater. In Vienna Friedell worked also as the codirector of Intimes
Theater.&nbsp;In 1923&nbsp;Friedell had a major role in Molière's <em>Imaginary Invalid</em>
in Reinhardt's Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. On stage spoke with a
typical Viennese accent which was difficult to understand for the
German theater audience. <i>Die Judastragödie </i>(1920), produced in the Vienna Burgtheater in 1923, portrayed Judas as a hero. It was followed by a prose work, <i>Das Jesusproblem</i> (1921). The play was performed only eight times. </p><p>Friedell's film, drama and literary criticism appeared in magazines and newspapers such as <i>Schaubühne</i>, published in Berlin, <i>Fackel</i>, establised by Karl Kraus, and <i>Neuen Wiener Journal. </i>Friedell
also translated or edited works by Emerson, Hebbel, Lichtenberg,
Carlyle, Hans Christian Andersen, Johann Nestroy, and Macaulay. In 1914
Friedell published a translation of Carlyle's <i>On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic 
History, </i>which emphasizes the role of the individual in history.</p>
<p><i>Die Reise mit der Zeitmaschine</i> (1946, The Return of the Time Machine), written in the mid-1930s, was a homage to H.G. Wells's classic science-fiction novel 
<i>The Time Machine</i> (1895). It included a spoof corresponcence
between Friedell and Wells's secretary. Friedell's main interest in his
work, which pretends that Well's story was literary true and depicts
later adventures of Wells's hero, is in the theory of the time machine.
Friedell, who wrote self-assuredly about Einstein's relativity theory
in <i>A Cultural History of the Modern Age</i>, develops a complex
mathematical&nbsp;scheme to prove the ultimate futility of time travel,
"the resistance of Earth time." In order to reach the past, one must
first travel into the future. The novel was reissued in 1974 as <span style="font-style: italic;">The </span><em style="font-style: italic;">Return of the Time Machine</em>
(Die Rückkehr der Zeitmaschine). It was translated by Eddy C. Bertin
for DAW books in 1972 and reprinted by Starmont House in 1987. <br>
 </p>
<p><i>A Cultural History of the Modern Age</i>, inspired by H.G. Well's 
<i>The Outline of History</i> (1920), was dedicated to Max Reinhardt.
Its first volume dealt with Renaissance and Reformation, the second
Baroque, Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and the third part
Romanticism, Liberalism, Imperialism, and Impressionism. Friedell's
view is subjective and intuitive &#8211; all history is saga and myth and it
is nothing more than a difference in degree between historian and poet.
"All the classifications man has ever devised are arbitrary,
artificial, and false," Friedell wrote, "but simple reflection also
shows that such classifications are useful, indispensable, and above
all unavoidable since they accord with an innate aspect of our
thinking." Following the Hegelian lines of though, Friedell sees his
subject basically as a the process of spiritual history. <a href="spengle.htm">Oswald Spengler</a>'s (<i>The Decline of the West</i>,
1918-1922) pessimism and atheism he rejects. From the English writer,
historian, and critic Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881) Friedell adopted the
romantic "great man" theory of history, the hero-worship, totally
ignoring its ominous connection with the political reality of his day.
Every era and every generation has according to Friedell its own hero,
a genius, who personifies the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age.
Nietzsche was for Friedell the epitome of the pre-WW I era. </p>
<p>After finishing <i>A Cultural History of the Modern Age </i>Friedell started to work&nbsp;on the 
two-volume cultural history of antiquity, <i>Kusturgeschichte des Altertums</i>, which he did 
not complete. However, its first part&nbsp;came out&nbsp;
in&nbsp;Switzerland in 1936, after publishers in Germany refused to accept anything from Friedell. 
</p><p>The Nazis invaded Austria in March 1938 and the country was incorporated into 
Hitler's Reich. Anti-Semitism broke out in full force. Jewish apartments and synagogues were 
ransacked and men and women were beaten on the streets. Friedell's books were banned 
and his position was not only intolerable but he knew he could be arrested by 
Gestapo. On March 16, 1938, shortly after the "Anschluss" (annexation), 
Friedell leaped from a window to his death, as he&nbsp;heard storm troopers coming
 to his apartment. His last words, according to a dark anecdote, 
were: "Watch out, please!" Friedell was buried in Vienna's Central Cemetery. </p>
