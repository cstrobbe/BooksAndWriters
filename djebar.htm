<p>Algerian novelist, translator, and filmmaker, one of North-Africa's
best-known and most widely acclaimed writers. Assia Djebar has also
published poetry, plays, and short stories, and has produced two films.
Djebar has explored the struggle for social emancipation and the Muslim
woman's world in its complexities. Several of her works deal with the
impact of the war on women's mind. Her strong feminist stance has
earned her much praise but also considerable hostility from nationalist
critics in Algeria. </p> 

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Just so I could have worries that never
change whether it's peace or wartime, so I could wake up in the middle
of the night and question myself on what it is that sleeps in the
depths of the heart of the man sharing my bed... Just so I could give
birth and weep, for life never comes unaccompanied to a woman, death is
always right behind, furtive, quick, and smiling at the mothers..." </b></font> <font size="2">(from 'There Is No Exile' in <i>Women in Their Apartments</i>, 1980) </font></blockquote>
<p>Assia Djebar was born in Cherchell, a small coastal town near
Algiers. She attended the primary school where her father taught
French, and completed secondary school studies in Algiers. After her
studies at the Lycée Fénélon in Paris, she became the first Algerian
woman to be accepted at the École Normale Supérieure. She joined in the
Algerian student strike of 1956, in the early years of the Algerian
independence struggle. During the war French soldiers burst into her
mother's apartment and tore her books. Djebar's brother was in a prison
in France. </p>
<p>In 1958 Djebar married Ahmed Ould-Rouïs, a member of the Resistance.
The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1980 she married the poet Malek
Alloula. In Tunis she wrote the short story 'There is No Exile' but did
not publish it until 1980, as though she did not want to voice her
doubts about the war at the time. Djebar returned in <i>Algerian White</i> (1995) to the aftermath of the struggle and the deaths of her three friends.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"The other women have grown silent," I
said. "The only one left to weep now is the mother... Such is life," I
added a moment later. "There are those who forget or who simply sleep.
And then there are those who keep bumping into the walls of the past.
May God take pity on them!"'</b></font> <font size="2">(from 'There Is No Exile')</font></blockquote>
<p>Between 1957 and 1967 Djebar wrote four novels, making her debut with <span style="font-style: italic;">La soif</span>
(The Mischief). The novel was written in two months during the student
uprising in 1956. Fearing her father's disapproval, she adopted the pen
name she has kept ever since. The protagonist of the novel,
half-French, half-Algerian Nadia is a westernized Algerian girl. She
lives a carefree life, tries to seduce her friend's husband in order to
make her own boyfriend jealous. Below the surface reader encounters a
serious study of psychological development. The book was compared to
François Sagan's <i>Bonjour tristesse</i>. In Algeria it was condemned for ignoring the political realities of the day. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Les impatients</span> (1958)
was set before the independence struggle and centers upon a young
woman, Dalila, who feels herself trapped in a family environment of
domineering men and frustrated women. <span style="font-style: italic;">Les enfants du nouveau monde</span>
(1962) explored the awakening of Algerian women to new demands. The
heroine is in the collective action for political change and the themes
of love and war, the past and the present, continued in <span style="font-style: italic;">Les alouettes naïves</span> (1967), 
which depicted a woman's rebel against patriarchy. After completing the novel, Djebar temporarily stopped from 
writing and turned her attention to film. </p>

<p>During the liberation war Djebar collaborated with the anti-colonial FLN (National Liberation Front) newspaper 
<i>El-Moujahid</i> by conducting interviews with Algerian refugees in
Morocco and Tunis. She pursued her work in the history as a teaching
assistant at the University of Rabat and participated in various
Algerian cultural activities. During her stay in Morocco Djebar wrote
her third novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Les enfants du nouveau monde</span>. </p>
<p>After Algeria gained gained independence, Djebar was criticized for
writing in French, when writers were supposed to switch to the national
language, Arabic. She taught North African history at the Faculty of
Letters and worked with the Algerian press and radio.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the 1970s Djebar studied classical Arabic to enlarge her ways of
expression. In her later novels she has manipulated the French
language, giving it the sounds and rhythms of Arabic, and turning the
language of the colonizer into language of resistance. When Djebar
began to work with her autobiographical novels, she had to overcome the
"impersonality of French" and the fact, that she was using "the
language of the Others". Djebar also turned to cinema to reach those
who cannot read. Her first film, <i>La Nouba des femmes du Mont Chenoua</i> (1979),  won the International Critics Prize at the 1979 Film Festival in Venice. <i>La Zerda et les chants de l'oubli </i>(1982) was chronicle of life in the Maghreb from the early to the mid-twentieth century. </p>
<p>Djubar's long literary silence in the 1970s was partly due to her
recognition that she was not going to become an Arabic-language writer
and her interest in non-literary art forms. She worked as an assistant
director on a number of productions. In 1973 she directed her own
adaptation of Tom Eyen's play about Marilyn Monroe, <i>The White Whore and the Bit Player</i>. When Djebar returned to the University of Algiers, she began teaching theater and film. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Les Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartement</span> (1980, Women of Algiers in Their Apartment) was a collection of short stories, 
and meant a turning point in Djebar's career as a writer:<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"I had just turned forty. It's at 
that point that I finally felt myself fully a writer of French language, while remaining deeply 
Algerian." Coming after an silence of ten years, 
the book was welcomed in critical circles. It took its title from the famous Delacroix's painting and  
depicted the cloistered Algerian women, who are still imprisoned in the harem. However, Djebar gave her 
characters dignity and wisdom. The second version of the book from 2002 contained a supplemental novel in 
addition to the first version. </p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">L'Amour, la fantasia</span> (1985, Fantasia: an Algerian Cavalcade), winner of the Franco-Arab Friendship Prize, 
mixed autobiography, historical accounts of the French conquest of 1830, and the Algerian War. 
It was the first volume of the Algerian quartet about Maghrebian women, 
which continued in  (1987, A Sister to Scheherazade), a story of two women. <span style="font-style: italic;">Loin de Medine</span> (1991) 
explored the lives of women in the life of the prophet Mohammed. This book was prompted by the 
fundamentalist street riots in Algeria. When excerpts were published, "the bearded ones" 
wanted to burn her, and "the beardless ones" defended her, as Djebar later said. </p>
<p>Djebar has often looked pessimistically women's ability to change an overbearing patriarchy. 
In the autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">Vaste est la prison</span> (1995, So Vast the Prison) the narrator links her own life 
as a modern, educated Algerian woman,  with the traditions of her female notable ancestors and the history 
of Carthage, a great civilization the Berbers were once compared to. The protagonist is 36-year-old  Isma,  a 
musicologist and filmmaker, who realizes: "We think the dead are absent but, transformed into witnesses, 
they want to write through us." </p>
<p>Djebar taught history for many years at the University of Algiers. She won the Neustadt Prize for Contributions 
to World Literature in 1996 for perceptively crossing borders of culture, language, and history in her fiction and 
poetry. In 1997 she received  the <a href="/margyour.htm">Yourcenar</a> Prize and in 2000 the prestigious Friedenspreis 
des Deutschen Buchhandels.  Djebar was appointed in 1997 professor and director of the Center for French and Francophone 
studies of the Louisiana State University. Since Fall 2001, Djebar has been Silver Chair Professor of French and 
Francophone studies at New York University. Djebar is a member of the 'Académie Royale de Langue Francaise de 
Belgique. In 2005 Djebar became a member of the French Academy. Her major novels have not been translated into 
Arabic in her native Algeria, but English translations are read by a wide audience in Europe and in North America.  
For many years, Djebar has been mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. </p>
