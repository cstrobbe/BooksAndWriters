<p>South-African novelist, critic, and translator, who was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003. The violent history and politics of
his native country, especially apartheid, has provided Coetzee much raw
material for his work, but none of his books have been censored by the
authorities. Often he has examined the effects of oppression
within frameworks derived from postmodernist thought. Coetzee's
reflective, unaffected and precise style cannot be characterized as
experimental, but in his novels he has methodically broken the
conventions of narration. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He continues to teach because it
provides him with a livelihood; also because it teaches him humility,
brings it home to him who he is in the world. The irony does not escape
him: that the one who comes to teach learns the keenest of lessons,
while those who come to learn learn nothing."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Disgrace</font></i><font size="2">, 1999) </font></blockquote>

<p>John Maxwell Coetzee, a descendant from 17th-century Dutch settlers,
was born in Cape Town. His father was a lawyer and his mother a
schoolteacher. In his memoir, <i>Boyhood </i>(1997), Coetzee
portrayed himself as a sickly, bookish boys, who adored his
freedom-loving mother: "I will not be a prisoner in this house, she
says. I will be free." At home Cotzee spoke English and with other
relatives Afrikaans &#8211; his parents wanted to be English. Coetzee studied
both mathematics and literature at the University of Cape Town. After
graduating, he moved to England, where he worked as an applications
programmer (1962-63) in London. His evening Coetzee spent in the
British Museum, "reading Ford Madox Ford, and the rest of the time
tramping the cold streets of London seeking the meaning of life," as he
later said. From London he moved to Bracknell, Berkshire, where he
worked as a systems programmer for a computer company. </p>

<p>In 1969 Coetzee received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas with
aa dissertation on Beckett. From 1968 to 1971 he taught at the State
University of New York at Buffalo. While in Buffalo, Coetzee started to
Write his first book, <i>Dusklands</i>
(1974), which consists of two closely related novellas, one about
America and Vietnam, the other, 'The Narrative of Jacobus Coetzee', set
in the 1760s. In 1972 he became a lecturer at the University of Cape
Town, at that time an institution for whites, and was later appointed
professor of literature. From 2002 Coetzee has lived in Australia with
his partner, Professor Dorothy Driver. In an interview he said, that
"leaving a country is, in some respects, like the break-up of a
marriage. It is an intimate matter." </p>

<p>Coetzee's works cannot be classified as belonging to any specific
postmodernist intellectual current. His essays reveal interest in
linguistics, generative grammar, stylistics, structuralism, semiotics,
and deconstruction. The dilemmas of his novels are based on South
African reality, but often presented in a timeless, metafictional form
and carrying a plurality of meanings. <i>In the Heart of the Country</i> (1977), in which the central character is a rebellious, sexually deprived daughter of a sheepfarmer, Coetzee examined the 
conventions of the South African <i>plaasroman</i>, or farm novel.  The calmly written torture scenes of <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i>
(1980) questioned the voyeuristic nature of fiction. The title of the
novel referred to a poem by Constantin Cavafy: "and now, what will
become of us without / barbarians? / These people were a kind of
solution." </p>

<p><i>Life and Times of Michael K</i> (1983) won the Booker Prize, but
Coetzee did not attend the ceremonies. (In some sources, Coetzee's
second name is Michael, or Marie.) The protagonist of the story, set in
a future Cape Town and Karoo, is a descendant of Franz Kafka's
characters, who never find out the meaning of their suffering, like the
victim of the execution machine in the short story 'In der
Strafkolonie' (1919). Michael K eventually ends up in a concentration
camp. Cynthia Ozick wrote of the book: "Mr. Coetzee's subdued yet
urgent lament is for the sadness of South Africa that has made
dependents and parasites and prisoners of its own children, black and
white." </p>

<p> <i>Foe </i>(1986) played with Defoe's classic novel <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.
In the story a woman, Susan Barton, shares the island with Robinson
Cruso and Friday. "I am cast away. I am all alone," she says without
getting any sympathy from Cruso, the cruel tyrant of his small empire.
After they are rescued, Susan meets Daniel Foe and becomes his muse,
whom he forgets. Friday remains mute, his tongue is cut, and he is
never allowed to tell his own tale. In <i>The Master of Petersburg</i>
(1994) the protagonist is the famous Russian writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky,
who tries to understand the death of his stepson, Pavel Alexandrovich
Isaev. In his sorrow he takes the role of Orpheus: "He thinks of
Orpheus walking backwards step by step, whispering the dead woman's
name, coaxing her out of the entrails of hell; of the wife in
graveclothes with he blind, dead eyes following him, holding out limp
hands before her like a sleepwalker. No flute, no lyre, just the word,
the one word, over and over." Coetzee himself has lost his son. He died
in a mysterious fall from a high balcony. </p>

<p>Before producing <i>Age of Iron</i> (1990) Coetzee also suffered from a personal tragedy - his ex-wife died of cancer. <i>Boyhood: Scenes from Provincial Life </i>(1997) started Coetzee's semi-autobiographical series, which continued in <i>Youth: Scenes from Provincial Life II</i> (2002). Both works are written in the third person. "<i>Boyhood</i> and <i>Youth</i>, after all, aren't an objective record of Coetzee's young life," William Deresiewicz wrote in <i>The New York Times</i>
(July 7, 2002), "they are the 50-something Coetzee's reconstruction,
seven or eight novels later, of that life." The third volume of the
autobiography, <i>Summertime</i> (2009), introduces a fictional 
character, Vincent, who serves as a biographer of the author &#8211; already dead. In <i>Elizabeth Costello: Eight Lessons</i>
(2003) Coetzee invented his female alter ego, a famous writer, who
travels all over the world and gives speeches and academic lectures. In
the United States she discusses and analyzes Kafka's monkey story 'A
Report to the Academy' (lesson 1), in England at the fictional Appleton
College she drew a parallel between gas chambers and the breeding of
animals for slaughter (lesson 3), and in Amsterdam her subject is the
problem of evil (lesson 6). As a material Coetzee used his own academic
lectures, but at the same time he strips bare Costello's intellectual
lifestyle &#8211; although her arguments are always fresh and seductive, the
result of all her theoretizing is that she starts resemble more and
more the copy of Kafka's primate, whose basic predicletions and moral
ideas are contrary to the real world. Costello resurfaced in <i>Slow Man</i> (2005), about a misanthropic photographer, 
who has lost his leg in an accident and who falls in love with a married Croat woman. 
In this story the protagonist is perhaps a figure imagined by Costello. </p>
