<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American writer whose
autobiographical novels had a liberating influence on mid-20th century
literature. Because of the frank portrayals of sexuality, Miller's
major novels have been banned in several countries. In the 1960s Miller
became one of the most widely read US authors. In his autobiographical
works Miller created a myth out of his own life, about a free-spirited,
penniless American writer who has a number of affairs and spends his
time between New York and Paris. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The bulk of my readers, I have
often observed, fall into two distinct groups: in the one group those
who claim to be repelled or disgusted by the liberal dosage of sex, and
in the other those who are delighted to find that this element form
such a large ingredient." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The
World of Sex</font></i><font size="2">, 1965) </font>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Henry Valentine Miller was born in New York, N.Y, the first
child of German-American working-class parents. Miller had also a
younger sister, Lauretta Anna, who was mentally handicapped and whom he
often had to defend from the other kids who would make fun of her.
Miller's father, Heinrich Miller, was a tailor. Louise (Nieting)
Miller, his mother, never showed much affection toward her son&nbsp;&#8211;
she used to hit her children, also Miller's sister. </p>
      <p>At school Miller was a very good pupil.&nbsp;He attended the
college of the City of New York, but left after two months. In <em>Stand
Still like the Hummingbird</em> (1962) the author explained that it was
Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i> which decided the issue for him. "To
think that this huge epic is still considered indispensable reading in
any college curriculum! Only the other day I dipped into it again, to
reassure myself that I had not made a grave error of judgment. Let me
confess that today it seems even more insane to me than when I was a
lad of eighteen. I am talking, be it understood, of "the poets' poet,"
as the English call him. What a poor second to Pindar!"
Miller had been a voluminous reader from his childhood. At that time
his favorites were Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and Elie Faure, whose study, <i>History
of Art</i>, had been translated into English by one of his father's
customers. </p>
      <p>At the age of seventeen, Miller visited for the first time a
brothel,&nbsp;contracting gonorrhea.&nbsp;He worked briefly for a
cement company, took then odd jobs, and started in 1909 an affair with
Pauline Chouteau, who was 37-years old. Unable to settle down, he
travelled throughout South West USA and Alaska with money, which was
intended to finance him through Cornell. In 1913 he went to work
at&nbsp;the family&nbsp;tailor's shop,&nbsp;but had
difficulties&nbsp;with his father&nbsp;whose drinking had increased. In
1917 Miller married Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, a amateur pianist, and
became a father. He had also a brief affair with his mother-in-law. </p>
      <p>From 1920 to 1924 Miller was employed by the Western Union
Telegraph Company. After&nbsp;leving his family, he&nbsp;lived a with
June Mansfield Smith, a Broadway dancer, who encouraged Miller in his
writing aspirations. The relationship inspired Miller's early novels <em>Moloch
, </em>a rant against Jews, and <em>Crazy Cock</em>&nbsp;(published
posthumously&nbsp;in 1991). Later Miller returned to this period in the
trilogy <em>The Rosy&nbsp;Crucifixion</em>. </p>
      <p>Miller did not seriously begin to write until he was 40,
although he had published essays and short stories in a magazine in the
late 1910s. <em>Clipped Wings</em>,&nbsp;completed in 1922, was
rejected by the publishing company Macmillan. His wife June&nbsp;earned
extra income&nbsp;as a waiter and occasionally sold her body to support
them both. Her restless life style, which first had fascinated Miller,
made him miserable. </p>
      <p>Changing the direction of his life,&nbsp;Miller&nbsp;moved in
1930 to France, Paris, where he became a familiar sight with his
olive-green overcoat, wide-brimmed grey felt hat, and protruding bottom
lip. Miller was penniless, but Alfred Perlés, an Austrian writer, paid
his rent and his cafe bills, and June sent money. Also <a href="anaisnin.htm">Anaïs Nin</a>, who entered his life in 1931,
supported him. In the fall of his second year in Paris Miller wrote: "I
have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive."
Miller's early books were published almost exclusively by the Obelisk
Press, founded by Jack Kahane, who&nbsp;published erotic novels under
the pseudonyms of Cecil Barr and Basil Carr. After living two years at
Clichy, Miller moved in autumn to the Villa Seurat in the 14th
arrondissement of Paris. </p>
      <p>With his friend Gilberte Brassaï, born Gyula Halász, who
gained fame as a photographer, Miller shared love of the city at night.
"I have found my counterpart in dear Halász," he said to his literary
agent, Frank Dobo, "a "wanderer" like me, who sets out on an
exploration with no other aim but continual investigation." Miller also
wrote an article on Brassaï, 'The Eye of Paris', stating: "Perhaps the
difference which I observe between the work of Brassaï and that of
other photographers lies in this&nbsp;&#8211; that Brassaï seems overwhelmed
by the fullness of life." </p>
      <p>During this time Miller came under the influence of
surrealism, <a href="lfceline.htm">Céline</a>, and the literary
circle, which included <a href="durrell.htm">Lawrence Durrell</a> and
Anaïs Nin. He created sensation with his classic first works, <em>Tropic
of Cancer</em>&nbsp;(1934) and <em>Tropic of&nbsp;Capricorn</em>
(1936), which offered a vivid picture of bohemian life in Paris and New
York. The books were banned for nearly three decades in the U.S.,
before decision by the U.S. Supreme Court upheld their literary value.
An instant bestseller,&nbsp;<em>Tropic of Cancer</em> made Miller a
prophet of sexual freedom. </p>
      <p>When the English writer George Orwell travelled to Spain to
report on the Civil War, he stopped in Paris and met Miller, who told
him that he was a pacifist. Miller's major works from this period
include&nbsp;<em>Black Spring</em>&nbsp;(1936), based on his
childhood's experiences in Brooklyn, and <em>The Colossus of Maroussi</em>
(1941), inspired by his visit to Greece in 1939. The triangular
relationship between Miller, June and Nin formed the basis for several
of Nin's journals and the film <i>Henry and June</i> (1990).</p>
      <p>With the outbreak of World War II, Miller returned to the USA,
feeling that he had failed as a writer. At John Steinbeck's birthday in
Monterrey he made love to one of the guests on the lawn. In 1942 he
moved to California and lived from 1947 in Big Sur on the coast. "It is
my belief that the immature artist seldom thrives in idyllic
surroundings," Miller said in <em>Big Sur and the Oranges of
Hieronymus Bosch</em>&nbsp;(1957). "If an art colony is established
here it will go the way all the others. Artists never thrive in
colonies. Ants do. What the budding artists needs is the privilege of
wrestling with his problems in solitude&nbsp;&#8211; and now and then a piece
of red meat." In 1944 Miller married Janina Martha Lepska, a young
philosophy student, who was over 30 years his junior. Their marriage
ended after seven years. "I live all alone like a monk, a celibate, an
exile," Miller&nbsp; confessed to his old friend Brassaï. (Brassaï's
archives contain 168 letters from Miller.) However, Miller found soon a
new companion, Eve McClure, an artist, whom he married in 1953. </p>
      <p>In 1957 Miller was elected to the National Institute of Arts
and Letters. He wrote prolifically, revisited Europe numerous times and
painted water colors. Miller had began to paint in the 1920s and
continued to produce watercolors until the final days of his life.
Grove Press published<i> Tropic of Cancer</i> in 1961 and the book
gained a huge popularity. Miller was not enthusiastic about his imago,
when his readers hailed him as the grand old man of sex. At that time
he did not see himself as an "outlaw writer" and in interviews he tried
to direct the discussion from sex to other subjects, without much
success. </p>
      <p>In the early 1960s Miller had affair with Renate Gerhardt, a
German translator. When she founded a publishing company, Miller helped
her financially. Most of his life Miller had lived without regular
income, but when his books started sell, he bought a house on Ocampo
Drive 444 in the Pacific Palisades, which looked like it belonged to a
movie star. He also had to hire accountants and lawyers to plan taxes.
In 1969 the feminist writer Kate Millet attacked Miller in his book <i>Sexual
Politics</i>, and two years later Norman Mailer defended him in <i>The
Prisoner of Sex</i>. Miller died in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980.
He was married five times. In 1967 he married a young Japanese cabaret
singer, Hiroko "Hoki" Tokuda, who refused to have sex with the old
writer. They divorced in 1977. She later ran a Tokyo night-club called
'Tropic of Cancer'. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Henry was so enthralled by women
that he sought to demystify their mysterious parts through the violent
verbal magic of his books. The violence is rooted in a sense of
self-abnegation and humiliation before them. He is, as the Freudians
would say, counterphobic.'' </b></font><font size="2">(Erica Jong in <i>The Devil at Large, 1993) </i></font></blockquote>
      <p>Miller's later books include <em>The Air-Conditioned Nightmare</em>
(1945), a critical view of the United States, <em>Quiet Days in Clichy</em>
(1956), depicting his life as a penniless writer in Paris, and <em>The
Rosy Crucifixion</em>&nbsp;trilogy (1965), which traced the crucial
years of the narrator-hero in the United States during which he
struggles to became a writer. "I'm a desperado of love, a scalper, a
slayer. I'm insatiable," Miller wrote in the first part, <i>Sexus</i>.
"I eat hair, dirty wax, dry blood clots, anything and everything you
call yours. Show me your father, with his kites, his race horses, his
free passes for the opera: I will eat them all, swallow them
alive."&nbsp;A study of the French poet <a href="rimbaud.htm">Arthur
Rimbaud</a>, whose rebelliousness attracted Miller, came out in 1951. </p>
      <p>Along with<a href="dhlawren.htm"> D.H. Lawrence</a>'s <i>Lady
Chatterly's Lover</i> and <a href="wbburrou.htm">William Burroughs</a>'s
      <i>The Naked Lunch, </i>Miller's works helped to push back the
boundaries of censorship in the 1950s&nbsp; He also influenced the <a href="kerouac.htm">Beat Movement</a> writers. Miller's last love was
Brenda Venus, an actress; his letters to her were published in 1986.
Also various volumes of Miller's correspondence with Lawrence Durrell,
Anais Nin and Wallace Fowlie have been published. </p>
