<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English novelist, composer, and critic,
whose novels are characterized by verbal inventiveness and social
satire. Burgess has also written several biographies. However, the
author's first love was music: he composed a number of works before
publishing his first books. Among Burgess's best-known novels is <span style="font-style: italic;">A Clockwork Orange </span>(1962). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'What's going to be then, eh?' </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs,
that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, dim being really dim, and we sat in the

flip dark chill winter bastard through dry."</font></b><font size="2">
(the beginning of </font><i><font size="2">A Clockwork Orange</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>John Anthony Burgess Wilson was born in Manchester into a
Catholic middle-class family. His father was a cashier and pub pianist.
After his mother died in the flu pandemic of 1919, he was brought up by
a maternal aunt and later by a stepmother. Burgess studied at Xaverian
College and Manchester University, where he read English language and
literature, graduating in 1940. During World War II Burgess served in
the Royal Army Medical corps, leaving the army as a sergeant-major. In
1942 he married Llwela Isherwood Jones, who died of alcoholic cirrhosis
in 1968.</p>
      <p>From 1946 to 1950 Burgess lectured at Birmingham University,
he was the Ministry of Education lecturer in phonetics, and taught at
Banbury Grammar School. Until 1959 Burgess wrote comparatively little,
but primararily studied music composition. His first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Vision of Battlement</span>, was
completed in 1949 but published in 1965. It was loosely based on the <i>Aeneid
      </i>and showed the influence of Joyce.<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Worm and the Ring</span>, which drew
on his experiences as a grammar school teacher, was withdrawn and
pulped soon after its appearance in 1961 as the result of a libel
action. <span style="font-style: italic;">Mersa Matruh&nbsp; </span>(1956),
a war story published by Digit Books, was set in a North African
holiday resort which became the front line town in September, 1940. </p>
      <p>In 1954 Burgess became an education officer in Malaya and
Brunei, and wrote during this time his trilogy <span style="font-style: italic;">Time for a Tiger </span>(1956),<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Enemy in the Blanket</span> (1958),
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Beds in the East</span> (1959).
Later he said that "Malaya acted as a midwife to a wordly gift that had
an inordinately long gestation." The work juxtaposed the progressive
disintegration of a hapless British civil servant, Victor Crabbe,
against the birth of Malayan independence. At the time of its
appearance, the trilogy attracted relatively little attention. </p>
      <p>After collapsing in classroom at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin
College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, Burgess returned to England.
"One day in the classroom I decided that I'd had enough... I just lay
down on the floor." Later Burgess told, that he was diagnosed as having
a cerebral tumor, and given twelve months to live. It has been
suggested, that the story was fabricated &#8211; there's no medical evidence
for his too early death sentence. However, Burgess set off a rush of
literary activity and lived another 33 years. He wrote feverishly,
producing over fifty books and hundreds of journalistic pieces. His
first wife Lynne proposed the pseudonym Anthony Powell and her second
suggestion was Anthony Gilwern. Burgess was the maiden name of John
Wilson's mother. He also used the pseudonym Joseph Kell and once
reviewed Kell's novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Inside Mr
Enderby</span> (1963) for the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>; when the editor
sent him the author's novel &#8211; Burgess thought it was a practical joke
but it wasn't. Burgess himself wrote letters to the editor of the <i>Daily
Mail </i>as Mohamed Ali, an outraged Pakistani moralist. </p>
      <p>In 1959 Burgess devoted himself entirely to writing, living
since in Malta, Italy, US, and Monaco. Between the years 1960 and 1964
Burgess wrote eleven novels. <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Wanting Seed</span> (1962) depicted an overpopulated England of the
future, caught up in the alternating cycles of libertarianism and
totalitarianism. In 1962 his most famous science fiction fable, <i>A
Clockwork Orange</i> appeared, which made him famous as a satirical
novelist, and which was filmed by Stanley Kubrick in the 1970s. The
novel was born from the growth of teenage gangs and the universal
application of B.F. Skinner's behavior theories in prisons, asylums,
and psychiatric clinics. In 1961 Burgess had also observed the <i>stilyaqi</i>,
gangs of young thugs, in Leningrad. </p>
      <p><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> is set in a future London and is
told in <i>nadsat</i>, a mixture of Russian, English and American
slang, gypsy talk and, odd bits of Jacobean prose. Burgess has given at
least three explanations for the title of the book. One is that it is a
Cockney expression ("as queer as a clockwork orange"), which he
overheard in a London pub in 1945. In an essay published in the
Listener, Burgess claimed that the title was a pun on the Malay word <i>orang</i>,
meaning man. And the third explanation is that the title is a metaphor
for "an organic entity, full of juice and sweetness and agreeable
odour, being turned into an automaton." (prefatory note to <i>A
Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music</i>, 1987) Gary Dexter has
suggested in <i>Why Not Catch-21</i> (2007) that Burgess had misheard
in the pub "Chocolate Orange", a part of everyday speech in 1940
London, as "a clockwork orange". </p>
      <p>Alex, the main character, is a juvenile delinquent, who rapes
and kills people with his "droogs" (friends). He is captured, and
brainwashed by the Ludovico technique to change his murderous
aggressions. As an unexpected side effect of the Pavlovian treatment he
starts to hate Beethoven's music, his unspoiled self. The central
question of the story is a philosophical one: is an "evil" human being
with free will preferable to a "good" citizen without it? The character
of Alex, played in the film by Malcolm McDowell, gained cult status.
Kubrick later withdrew his film following a moral panic about a copycat
killing allegedly performed by a youth wearing the costume of Alex and
his droogs. <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> received Academy Award
nominations for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay but critics were
on the whole furious. Kauline Kael wrote in the <i>New Yorker</i>
(January 1, 1972): "Literal-minded in its sex and brutality, Teutonic
in its humor, Stanley Kubrick's <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> might be the
work of a strict and exacting German professor who set out to make a
porno-violent sci-fi comedy. Is there anything sadder &#8211; and ultimately
more repellent &#8211; than a clean-minded pornographer?... How can people go
on talking about the dazzling brilliance of movies and not notice that
the directors are sucking up to the thugs in the audience?" &#8211; The
original British Heineman edition includes a final chapter that
anticipates a future for Alex wherein he chooses a law-abiding life.
The American Norton version ends with Alex reverting to his natural,
evil self, in the hospital. "But you, O my brothers, remember sometimes
the little Alex that was. Amen. And all that cal." </p>
      <p>Burgess returned to the questions of <i>A Clockwork Orange </i>in
the humorous novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Enderby</span>
(1968), which followed the travels of a non-conforming poet in England
and the continent. In the sequel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Clockwork Testament; or, Enderby's End</span>&nbsp; (1975) the hero,
Burgess's alter ego, lived in New York. The book was a merciless
assault on American media and academia, and the decline of language. </p>
      <p>In 1968 Burgess married Liliana Macellari, a translator and
daughter of La Contessa Maria Lucrezia Pasi Piani della Pergola. They
spent much of their time on the Continent &#8211; although he managed to
appear frequently on TV chat shows and as a columnist in British
newspapers. When he appeared on BBC's Newsnight immediately after the
death of author Graham Greene, Burgess could not help talking about
himself. In 1970-71 Burgess was a visiting professor at Princeton
University, a Distinguished Professor at the City College of New York
(1972-72), and a writer-in-residence at the University of New York at
Buffalo (1976). He was appointed in 1972 a literary adviser to the
Guthrie Theatre, Minneapolis, in 1972. </p>
      <p>Burgess published in the 1970s and 1980s some thirty books,
among them&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The Earthly Powers </span>(1980).
"I write a thousand words a day," Burgess once said. "At that rate
you'll write <i>War and Peace</i> in a year... or very near the entire
output of E.M. Forster." <i>The Earthly Powers</i> is considered by
many critics Burgess's finest novel. It was narrated by an 81-year-old
successful, homosexual writer, Kenneth Toomey, a figure loosely based
on <a href="maugham.htm">W. Somerset Maugham</a>. The novel also had
many jokes about other major literary figures. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Kingdom of the Wicked</span> (1985)
takes the first years of Christianity as its subject. </p>
      <p>Burgess wrote film scripts and several critical studies &#8211; he
was a specialist in Shakespeare and Joyce. In 1972 he signed a
three-year contract as playwright-in-residence at the Tyrone Guthrie
Theatre. His musical compositions include symphonies, a ballet, and an
opera. Burgess's autobiographies, <span style="font-style: italic;">Little
Wilson and Big God</span> (1987) and <span style="font-style: italic;">You've
Had Your Time</span> (1990) reveal a more self-doubting person than the
one that was his public image. Burgess's third symphony was performed
at the University of Iowa in 1975, and his musical version of <i>Ulyssess,
Blooms and Dublin</i>, was performed on radio on the centenary of James
Joyce's death.</p>
