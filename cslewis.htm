<p>British literary critic, scholar and author, known for his classic fantasy stories for children,&nbsp;<em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> (1950-1956)<a href="tolkien.htm"></a>. Its has been said that without Lewis, <a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/tolkien.htm">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>'s <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lord of the Rings</span> might never have been written.&nbsp;
After a spiritual search Lewis became one of the most popular spokesmen
for Christianity, known as the "Apostle to the Skeptics." Lewis was a
fellow of the British Academy but his commercial and popular success
somewhat undermined his reputation in the academic world.&nbsp;<a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/tolkien.htm"></a> </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"'When Aslan said you could never go
back to Narnia, he meant the Narnia you were thinking of. But that was
not the real Narnia. That had a beginning and an end. It was only a
shadow or a copy of the real Narnia which has always been there and
always will be there: just as our own world, England and all, is only a
shadow or copy of something in Aslan's real world. You need not mourn
over Narnia, Lucy. All of the old Narnia that mattered, all the dear
creatures, have been drawn into the real Narnia through the Door. And
of course it is different; as different as a real thing is from a
shadow or as waking life is from a dream.'"</strong> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Last Battle</font></i><font size="2">, 1956) </font></blockquote>
<p>Clive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast, Ireland, the son of Albert
James Lewis, a solicitor, and Florence Augusta (née Hamilton), the
daughter of a Church of Ireland priest. Lewis was very close to his
mother, who taught him to love books and encouraged him to study French
and Latin. When he was six, the family moved into a house in the
Strandtown area of East Belfast. During his childhood, Lewis created
the imaginary country of Bloxen. In the attic of the house he had a
"study" where learned and first practiced the craft of writing. Many of
these tales were later published in <em>Boxen: The Imaginary World of the Young C. S. Lewis</em> (1985). </p>
<p>Lewis mother, a promising mathematician, died of cancer when he was
nine years old. In 1908 he was sent to the Wynyard School in Watford,
Hertfordshire, which he later on called "Belsea". Its headmaster was
committed to an insane asylum. Lewis once recalled his education at
Wynyard as the forced feeding of a "jungle of dates, battles, exports,
imports, and the like, forgotten as soon as learned and perfectly
useless had they been remembered." After attending Campbell College in
the
east of Belfast, where he developed a serious respiratory illness, and
abandoning his Christian faith at the Malvern College,
he was educated privatedly in Great Bookham, Surrey. <br>
</p>
<p>Like many other
students, he witnessed a number of homosexual relationships, but which
he himself rejected. Most of his life, Lewis was unmarried. "I am the product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms, upstairs
indoor silences, attics explored in solitude, distant noises of
gurgling cisterns and pipes, and the noise of wind under the tiles.
Also of endless books," Lewis wrote in his autobiographical book <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life</em> </span></span>(1955).
"There were books in the study, books in the drawing-room, books in the
cloakroom, books (two deep) in the great bookcase on the landing, books
in a bedroom, books piled as high as my shoulder in the cistern attic,
books of all kinds reflecting every transient stage of my parents'
interests, books readable and unreadable, books suitable for a child
and books most empathically not. Nothing was forbidden me. In the
seemingly endless rainy afternoons I took volume after volume from the
shelves..." Lewis's early favorites were Edith Nesbit's books, among
them <i>The Story of the Amulet </i>(1906), which mixed fantasy with reality, and the uncut edition of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>. Later he read the Norse myths and sagas, and such historical books as Henryk Sienkiewicz's <i>Quo Vadis</i> and Lew Wallace's <i>Ben Hur</i>. He also found <i>The Odyssey</i>, Voltaire, Milton and Spenser. Lewis's private tutor, W.T. Kirkpatrick, taught him to read Greek for pleasure. </p>
<p>In 1916, Lewis won a scholarship to University College, Oxfird. While in Keble
Kollege, where Lewis had joined a cadet battalion, Lewis met Mrs Janie
King Moore, a much older woman &#8211; she was 45 at that time and had
separated from her husband. Mrs Moore was the mother of Edward Francis
Courtenay ("Paddy") Moore, with whom Lewis shared rooms and who was
killed in combat. </p>
      <p>From
1917 to 1919 Lewis served in the Somerset Light Infantry. He
experienced on the battlefields of France the horrors of trench
warfare, but in his later writings he did not speak much of the Great
War. To calm his nerves under shell fire, he read voraciously and wrote
poems. In February 1918, he was hospitalized for "trench fever," a
disease spread by body lice. <br>
      </p>
      <p>During the Battle of Arras, Lewis was
wounded in the back by a German shell. While convalescing, he met again Mrs Moore, who
followed him to Oxford with her daughter Maureen. However, Lewis
concealed this from his father. In 1930 he moved into "The Kilns," a
house on the outskirts of Oxford. A number of children found shelter
and safety at the Kilns during WWII. Mrs Moore died in January 1951, at
the age of seventynine. In her later years she suffered from dementia
and was moved into a nursing home. </p>

<p>Lewis graduated in 1923 from University College, Oxford, where
became a fellow and tutor in English literature at Magdalen College,
Oxford, serving in that post nearly thirty years. For short periods he
served as a lecturer at the University of Wales, the University of
Durham, and other places. Lewis disliked traveling but he spent hours
each week responding to letters he received from all over the world.
His lectures were crowded &#8211; he had a phenomenal memory, and he could
speak spontaneously about Greek and Latin texts without notes. Between
1954 and 1963 he was professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at
Cambridge, remaining there until his death. </p>
<p>With J.R.R. Tolkien and Charles Williams, Lewis formed a literary
group called 'The Inklings', which took shape in the 1930s. Their
Tuesday lunchtime sessions at the <i>Bird and Baby</i> pub became a
well known part of Oxford social life. Tolkien himself was a Roman
Catholic and he was never quite happy with Lewis's embracing of the
Anglican Church. Williams died in 1945 and the meetings faded away in
1949. Acknowledging Tolkien's literary achievement with his <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lord of the Rings</span>
trilogy Lewis even proposed him for the 1961 Nobel Prize for
Literature. Among other members of the club were Christopher Tolkien
and Owen
Barfield. Lewis preferred the company of men. He considered that
women's minds were intrinsically inferior to men's. A visitor at the
Socratic Society of Oxford portrayed Lewis as "ruddy of complexion,
radiating health, of substantial girth all over, and his eyes sparkled
with mirth." </p>
<p>As <i>Surprised by Joy</i> demonstrates, the watershed in Lewis's
life was his conversion from atheism to Christianity. He had began to
lose his faith at the age of 13, partly due to his deep-rooted
pessimism, and partly due to pantheistic experiences and interest in
Wagner's music. After reading such writers as Chesterfield, Bergson,
George MacDonald, and George Herbert, and abandoning his youthful
snobbery, he became a deist in 1929, and later he was associated with
such neo-Christians as T.S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, Dorothy L. Sayers, and
J.R.R. Tolkien; some other teachers at Oxford also influenced him. </p>
<p>In the 1930s Lewis started to publish popular religious books, including <em>The Pilgrim's Regress</em>
(1933), a thinly disguised allegory of his own conversion, which he
wrote in Ireland in two weeks. Lewis's conversion and his reputation as
a prominent Christian writer and radio personality strained his
relationship with Mrs Moore, who declared herself an atheist later in
life. <em>The Screwtape Letters</em><strong> </strong>(1942) was a correspondence from a senior devil to his nephew concerning the latter's task of winning a young man to damnation. <span class="st"><em>The Problem of Pain</em> </span>(1940)
asked, "If God is good and all-powerful, why does he allow his
creatures to suffer pain?" Lewis suggested that much of the suffering
in God's world can be traced to the evil choices people make. In his
own life, Lewis followed Christian principles. He gave away two-thirds
of his income, sat at the bedside of the sick, and personally served
the poor. </p>
<p>Lewis's literary criticism opposed classical, traditional, and
purely literary values in favour of the biographical, psychological,
and impressionistic. However, it took a long period before he began to
appreciate modern poetry. Lewis was the chief spokesman for the view
that a good reader receives the text, it affects one's senses, but the
bad reader "uses" it &#8211; the text relieves one's life but does not add to
it. Among Lewis's most substantial books is&nbsp;<em>English Literature in the Sixteenth Century</em>&nbsp;(1954).
As an essayist Lewis did not avoid controversial issues. In 'The
Humanitarian Theory of Punishment' he questioned the idea that to seek
to "cure" a criminal is nobler than to rely on punishment. Islam he
described as "a Christian heresy." </p>
<p>In <em>Out of Silent Planet </em>(1938) Lewis put his Christian
beliefs in the setting of a science fiction story. The book started
Lewis's Ransom trilogy, where the achievements of science are in
alliance with those of demonic evil. In the first part Ransom is
kidnapped by an amoral Wellsian scientist, Weston, and taken to Mars.
The series continued in <em>Perelandra</em> (1943), in which an angel carries Ransom to Venus. In <em>That Hideous Strenght </em>(1945)
Ransom is back on Earth, and calls Merlin to fight against an
unpleasant scientific organization, the N.I.C.E., the National
Institute of Co-ordinated Experiments. </p>
<p><i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> has turned out to be the most
lasting of Lewis's novels. "I wrote the books I should have liked to
read," Lewis said. "That's always been my reason for writing." <i>The Chronicles</i>
tell the story of a group of children, who come into contact with the
mysterious other world of Narnia, where the lion Aslan is the prototype
of Christ. "I don't know where the Lion came from or why He came,"
Lewis explained later. "But once He was there He pulled the whole story
together." The portal to Narnia, a kind of medieval vision of Paradise,
is a wardrobe through which the four sibling children, Peter, Susan,
Edmund, and Lucy enter a secondary world. In the first story the bad
Witch is destroyed in a battle. In the sequels the children travel in
Narnia and meet sea monsters, dragons, mermaids, wizards and other
creatures. Turbaned, dark-skinned people called Calormenes, who worship
a demon named Tash, also cause trouble &#8211; Lewis's view of Muslims
couldn't be more explicit. The final books deal with Narnia's beginning
and end. In the last Armageddon story, with its death-and-resurrection
theme, the struggle is between young King Tirian and the forces of
evil, as represented by Shift the Ape and Puzzle the donkey. The
harmony of Narnia is destroyed and Father Time puts out the sun. Jill
and Eustache appear from a railway train to help young Tirian, "last of
the Kings of Narnia." Aslan reveals the truth: the children were killed
in a railway accident. "Your father and mother and all of you are &#8211; as
you used to call it in the Shadowlands &#8211; dead. The term is over: the
holidays have begun. The dream is ended; this is the morning." Lewis
ends the book telling that they lived happily ever after &#8211; it was for
them only the beginning of the real story. </p>
<p>Lewis was briefly married to Helen Joy Davidman, a Jewish American
poet, a former Communist, who had two children. They met in 1952, but
their correspondence had started before it. Lewis's years at Cambridge
were happy &#8211; Joy Davidman was always good-humoured and shared his
delight in argument for argument's sake. She died of cancer in 1960.
Lewis keep the marriage secret from Tolkien, which caused tension in
their friendship. Lewis's notes from this period was published under
the title <em>A Grief Observed</em> (1961) The relationship was the subject of the film <i>Shadowlands</i> (1994), directed by William Nicholson and starring Debra Winger and Anthony Hopkins. <i>Shadowlands</i>
was based on Nicholson's television script from 1985 and a successful
stage play. Lewis died of osteoporosis on November 22, 1963, the day
when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. <br>
</p>
      <p>Though Lewis returned to Ireland for his annual vacation almost every year
of his life and his language echoed his origins, his stature in the
Irish literary pantheon has remained marginal. In 1988
Kathryn Lindskoog published a study (<i>The C.S. Lewis Hoax</i>) in which she questioned the authenticity of a number of Lewis's works published from 1966 to 1991, among them <i>The Dark Tower</i> (1977). Lindskoog continued the debate in <i>Light in the Shadowlands</i> (2001), claiming that the author's posthumous books are at least partly spurious. </p>
