      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Japanese writer usually credited
with
reviving the traditional Japanese poetic form of <i>haiku</i>. Masaoka
Shiki was the founder of the magazine <i>Hototogisu</i> and despite
his brief life he became a highly esteemed critic in his time. His role
as a charismatic literary figure has shadowed his merits as a poet and
diarist.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Facing away from me </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Darning old </font><i><font size="2">tabi</font></i><font size="2"> - </font><br>
        <font size="2">My wife. </font></b> </blockquote>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>When the loofah bloomed </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">He choked on phlegm </font><br>
        <font size="2">And died.</font></b></blockquote>
      <p>Masaoka Shiki was born in Matsuyama in present-day Ehime
Prefecture. His father, Masaoka Hyata, was a low-ranking samurai, and
an alcoholic, who died when Masaoka was at the age of five. Masaoka's
mother, Yae, taught sewing in order to support the family. After his
father's death his maternal uncle became the family guardian. While
still at at school, Masaoka began to write prose and poetry. Under his
maternal grandfather, Ohara Kanzan, who was a Confucian scholar and a
"samurai's samurai", he studied Chinese classics. Later he said, that
being "a constant witness to the respect he was shown in all quarters,
I too wanted to become a scholar, to be his equal." In 1880 Masaoka
entered Matuyama Middle School. He planned to into law or politics, but
eventually he realized that he liked writing best. In 1883 he moved to
Tokyo, making the journey by boat and wearing a new kimono, which was
sewn by his mother. </p>
      <p>Between 1883 and 1885 Masaoka attended University Preparatory
College. In 1887, he met <a href="natsume.htm">Natsume Soseki </a>(1867-1916),
who later gained fame as a novelist and short story writer. After
becoming fascinated by philosophy, he read Herbert Spencer's <i>Philosophy
of Style</i> and wrote the essay 'Shiika no Kigen oyobi Hensen' (The
Origin and Development of Poetry), in which he utilized Spencer's
argument that "The shortest sentence is the best". Upon graduating,
Masaoka entered the Tokyo Imperial University, where he studied classic
Japanese literature, but eventually he stopped attending classes: "the
only studying I did was of haiku and novels." During this period he
began to travel around Japan. </p>
      <p>Masaoka's studies were abrupt because of health problems. The
rest of his life he devoted to the writing of haiku and waka (or
tanka). After withdrawing from the Imperial University, Masaoka was a
haiku editor of the newspaper <i>Nippon</i>, publishing there in 1893 <i>Indiscriminate
Attacks on the Literary World</i>, <i>Some Remarks om Basho</i> and
other writings. In 1892 Masaoka began his reform of the poetic form. At
that time the traditional seventeen-syllable verse form was considered
incapable of expressing the complexities of modern life. </p>
      <p>Regardless of his poor health, Masaoka went to China as a war
correspondent in 1895, saying, "What point is there in having been born
a man unless I can accompany the army?" However, he never witnessed any
action, because the war ended before he reached China. Masaoka fell
seriously ill; beset by tuberculosis, he remained an invalid for much
of the rest of his life. On his return trip, he had a lung hemorrhage
and was expected to die. Masaoka convalesced at Natsume Soseki's
two-storied cottage in the city Matsuyama, adjoined by a celebrated hot
spring resort. During his stay, he introduced the new haiku style to a
group of young haiku devotees and wrote <i>Haikai Taiyo</i> (The
Elements of Haiku). </p>
      <p>After returning to Tokyo, Masaoka continued to advocate the
reevaluation of the haiku and loosening its tight conventions, which he
saw dangerous for its development as an art form. He published several
essays on the subject, first attacking the great haiku master, Bashõ,
but later softened his views. His home became a meeting place for his
friends and followers, who gathered there to discuss literature. In
1897, Masaoka and his disciples founded the literary journal <i>Hototogisu</i>.
Next year he turned his attention to tanka in <i>Letters to the Tanka
Poets</i>. During the last years of his life, Masaoka was bound to his
six-foot sickbed &#8211; or as he described, "If I stretch my hand a little,
I can touch the tatami mat, but I can't stretch my legs beyond the end
of the futon to make my body confortable." Unable to go for a walk or
do any other form of exercise, Masaoka's primary physical enjoyment
become food. Masaoka also suffered from caries of the spine, but he
faced his illness and physical pain with dignity and ironic humor, as
can be seen in the autobiographical <i>Byosho rokushaku</i> (A
Six-foot Sickbed), which was serialized in <i>Nippon</i> in 1902.
Masaoka Shiki died in Tokyo on September 9, 1902, a few weeks before
his thirty-fifth birthday. His essays are still widely read. He never
married. </p>
      <p>Initially a prose writer, Masaoka devoted a major portion of
his short life to the collection and composition of haiku. He advocated
realistic observation based on the technique of "sketching" (<i>shasei</i>)
in the presentation of images. Masaoka himself adopted the practice of
going out into nature with notebooks and making there "sketches", thus
abandoning the traditional subject matter of haiku. His advice for an
aspiring poet was, "Use both imaginary pictures and real ones, but
prefer the real ones." For Masaoka, the traditional form of poetry was
a means for artistic, personal expression. In one tanka he wrote:
"people in our world / down their sake / to appear smart, knowing: / me
&#8211; I devour persimmons / and look like a monkey". In this and other
writings Masaoka avoided scholarly jargon. Through Masaoka's work the
haiku gained the prestige it had enjoyed during the Tokugawa period in
the 17th century. With his followers and influential writings, he also
helped to modernize the tanka. </p>
      <p>Masaoka's most important writings on the subject were <i>Dassai
Sho-oku Haiwa</i> (1892), <i>Haikai Taiyo</i> (1895), and <i>Haijin
Buson</i> (1897). <i>Basho Zatsudan</i> (1894) was a critical
examination of the principles of Bashõ. In Buson Yosa he found an
example of a gentleman who was gifted in poetry, calligraphy, and
painting. Masaoka's appreciation of visual arts was deepened by his
friendship with Nakamura Fusetsu (1866-1943), a Western-style artist,
who studied in Paris for a few years. His two diaries, published in
1901-1902, combine qualities of the classical Japanese poetic diary
with the self-revelation of modern autobiography. Posthumously appeared
a volume called <i>Songs from a Bamboo Village </i>(1904). The
recurring theme in his works is the juxtaposition of the author's own
inevitable fate with the ongoing life of nature and the human world.
Unable to move out of his room, the poet continued to record what he
saw around him: "again and again / I ask how high / the snow is". </p>
      <p><b>Haiku</b><b>: </b>Japan's most popular unrhymed poetic
form. Haiku consist of 17 syllables arranged in three lines containing
five, seven, and five syllables, respectively. Outstanding haiku
masters: Matsuo Bashõ (1644-1694), Buson Yosa (1716-1783), <a href="koba.htm">Kobayashi Issa</a> (1763-1827). Haiku's emphasis on
the immediate and concrete influenced early 20th century Imaginism in
Europe and America, especially through the efforts of Ezra Pound. Both
Masaoka and his successor Takahama Kyoshi (1874-1959) saw haiku as a
poetry of a single object. <b>Tanka</b><b>:</b> A Japanese fixed
form of verse of 31 syllables and five lines, the first and third of
which have five syllables, and the other seven (5-7-5-7-7). Tanka
focuses on the essence of one static event, image, mood. Until the
sixteenth century, near all poetry written in Japanese took the tanka
form. </p>
