<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->German philosopher and critic of culture, 
who influenced a number of the major writers and philosophers of the 20th 
century Germany and France. Nietzsche's most popular book, <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>
(1883-1885), went ignored at the time of its appearance. Full of
provocative ideas, Nietzsche was a master of aphoristic form and use of
contradictions. Before and after the rise and fall of the Nazis, he was
widely misrepresented as an anti-Semite and a woman hater, and many
philosophers found it difficult to take his writings seriously. Like
the Danish philosopher <a href="kierkega.htm">Kierkegaard</a> (1813-1855), Nietzsche often contradicted himself. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"All beings hitherto have created
something beyond themselves: and ye want to be the ebb of that great
tide, and would rather go back to the beast than surpass man? </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">
What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just
the same shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of
shame. </font><br>
<font size="2">
Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is
still worm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than
any of the apes. "</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">
(in <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Friedrich Nietzsche born&nbsp; in Röcken, near Leipzig,&nbsp;the son
of Karl Ludwig Nietzsche, a Lutheran pastor and&nbsp; Franziska
Nietzsche,&nbsp;a devout hausfrau. His father died&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;
mad&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp; in 1849. Franziska lost her youngest son in 1850 and
moved her family to Naumberg, where Nietzsche spent the rest of his
childhood with his mother, sister, father's mother, and two aunts. </p><p>Nietzsche
began to write of his intellectual maturation from an early age. During
his high school and college years,&nbsp;he penned nine autobiographical
sketches. <span class="st">After years of self-scrutiny </span>Nietzsche
refused to take communion, to the shock of his mother. "My dear old
Friz is a noble person, despite our differences of opinion," she wrote
to her brother. "He truly interprets life or, more accurately, time and
appreciates only the lofty and good and despises everything crude." </p><p>Rejecting his father's faith, Nietzsche became 
a lifelong rebel against Christianity. "In truth, there was only <i>one</i> Christian, and he died on the cross", he wrote in&nbsp; <em>Der Antichrist</em>
(1888). Nietzsche was brought up by pious female relatives. He studied
classical philology at the universities of Bonn (1864-65) and Leipzig
(1864-68), and became at the age of 25 a professor at the University of
Basel, Switzerland. Among his acquaintances was Jakob Burckhardt, the
writer of <i>The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy </i>(1860). During the 
Franco-Prussian was he served briefly as a medical orderly with the 
Prussian army. Nietzsche's military career was short: he contracted dysentery and diphtheria. </p>

<p>In 1872 Nietzsche published his first book,&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik</em>&nbsp;</span>
(The Birth of Tragedy). He diagnosed in it human beings as subject to
unconscious, involuntary, overwhelmingly self-destructive Dionysian
instincts. According to Nietzsche, against this tendency the Greeks
erected the sober, rational, and active Apollonian principle. </p>
<p>Nietzsche considered reality as an endless Becoming (Werden).
Apollinian power is associated with the creation of illusion&nbsp;&#8211; the
plastic arts deny the actuality of becoming with the illusion of
timeless beauty. Dionysian frenzy threatens to destroy all forms and
codes. Only the Apollinian power of the Greeks was able to control the
Dionysian flood. But all illusions are temporary, and in his
"experimentalist phase" (1878-1882) Nietzsche saw that the loss of
Apollinian spell will make the return to Dionysian actuality even more
painful. But it must be noted, that the Dionysus whom Nietzsche
celebrated in his later writings, was the synthesis of the two forces
and represented passion controlled. In the earlier work he favored
perhaps more Apollo. His thesis, however, was, that it took both to
make possible the birth of tragedy. Later in life Nietzsche addressed
Cosima Wagner as "Princess Ariadne" in his letters to her, and declared
that the author of them is the god Dionysus. </p>
<p>At Basel Nietzsche had become a close friend of 
Richard Wagner (1813-1883), and the second part of <i>The Birth of Tragedy </i>deals with Wagner's music. Nietzsche called the composer "Old Minotaur." 
In <i>History of Western Philosophy </i>Bertrand
Russell remarked: "Nietzsche's superman is very like Siegfried, except
that he knows Greek." By the end of the decade, Nietzsche became
interested in the French enlightenment, which ended in 1878 his
friendship with Wagner. The composer despised the French and searched
acceptance in Germany. Also Nietzsche did not accept the rising
Wagnerian cult at Bayreuth, especially with its anti-Semitism. The
religiosity of <i>Parsifal </i>was too much for him.. "What did I never forgive Wagner?... that he became <i>reichdeutsch</i>," Nietzsche wrote disillusioned. </p>
<p>Nietzsche gave up Prussian citizenship in 1869 and
remained stateless for the rest of his life. In 1879 Nietzsche resigned
his professorship&nbsp;&#8211; or was forced to give up his
chair&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;due to his headaches and poor health. He wandered
about Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, living in boardinghouses, and
producing most of his famous books. </p>

<p>Nietzsche respected that sincere and "genuine Christianity" which he considered "possible in all ages"&nbsp;&#8211; but Wagner's <i>Parsifal </i>with
its sickly Christianity clearly did not seem to him belonging in that
category. In Bayreuth Nietzsche had became increasingly aware of the
impossibility of serving both Wagner and his own call. </p>
<p><a href="salome.htm">Lou Andreas-Salomé</a> (1861-1937), the
talented and spirited daughter of a Russian army officer, became
Nietzsche's most painful love. "... I lust after this kind of soul",
Nietzsche wrote to her companion Paul Rée; actually he needed a young
person around him who is intelligent and educated enough to serve as
his assistant. "From which stars did we fall to meet each other here?"
were Nietzche's first words when he saw her at Saint Peter's Basilica. </p>
<p>In <i>Ecce Homo</i> Nietzsche praised her poem, 'Hymnus an das
Leben' (1882, Hymn to Life), which he set to music. "Whoever can find
any meaning at all in the last words of this poem will guess why I
preferred and admired it: they attain greatness. Pain is not considered
an objection to life: 'If you have no more happiness to give me, well
then! you still have suffering ...' Perhaps my music, too, attains
greatness at this point." Possibly Nietzsche proposed marriage to her,
although according to some sources he never did so. However, Nietzsche
told Andreas-Salomé that <i>Zarathustra</i><i></i> had been conceived
as an artistic substitute for the son he would never have. In Lucerne
Andreas-Salomé, Nietzsche and Rée had a photograph taken of themselves,
Lou kneeling in a small cart and holding a whip over the two man-team,
who are pulling the cart. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When thou goest to woman, take thy whip."</b></font></blockquote>
<p>Rejected by Andreas-Salomé, Nietzsche withdrew into the existence of a tourist-scholar. 
He spent summers in Switzerland and winters in Italy, and published his 
major works in a period of ten years.<strong> </strong><em>Also Sprach Zarathustra</em> (Thus Spoke Zarathustra) appeared first in three parts in 1883-1884 and was formally 
published in 1892. Among his other works were <em>Jenseits von Gut und Böse</em>&nbsp;(1886), <span class="st"><em>Zur Genealogie der Moral</em> </span>(1887),<em>&nbsp;Götzen-Dämmerung</em> (1889), and <em>Ecce Homo</em> 
(pub. in 1908, written in 1888). <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>
centered around the notions of the will to power, radical nihilism, and
the eternal recurrence. Pain, suffering, and contradictions are no
longer seen as objections to existence but as an expression of its
actual tensions. In a note entitled 'Anti-Darwin' Nietzsche stated that
"man as a species is not progressing." He substituted the ordinary
conception of progress for a doctrine of eternal recurrence, and
stressed the positive power of heroic suffering. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I call Christianity the one great curse,
the one enormous and innermost perversion, the one great instinct of
revenge, for which no means are too venomous, too underhand, too
underground and too petty - I call it the one immortal blemish of
mankind."</b> (in <i>The Twilight of the Idols</i>, 1888)
</font></blockquote>

<p>In January 1889 Nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown in Turin,
Italy. He was found in a street, weeping and embracing a horse.
Nietzsche lived first in an asylum and then in his family's care. His
insanity was probably due to an early syphilitic infection. During his
disease Nietzsche was almost invariably gentle and pleasant, and in
lucid hours he engaged in conversation. Nietzsche spent his last decade
in mental darkness and died in Weimar on August 25, 1900. After his
death, his sister Elisabeth secured the rights to his literary remains
and edited them for publication&nbsp;&#8211; sometimes in arbitrary and
distorted form. Elisabeth had married in 1885 Bernhard Förster, a
prominent leader of the German anti-Semitic movement which Nietzsche
loathed. "For my personal taste such an agitator is something
impossible for closer acquaintance,"<b><font size="2"> </font></b>he
wrote in a letter to his mother. In 1880s Elisabeth founded with
Förster a German colony in Paraguay, which was meant for the "Aryans
only." Förster killed himself 1889 when his hand was caught in the
till. How much Nietzsche's illness&nbsp;&#8211; dementia paralytica or
syphilis&nbsp;&#8211; affected his thinking and writing is open to
speculations. During the second period of brain syphilis the patient
often acts manic-depressively and has megalomaniac visions. During his
manic period in the 1880s Nietzsche produced <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, <i>The Gay Science</i>, and <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>. </p>

<p>Nietzsche believed that all life evidences a will to power. Hopes
for a higher state of being after death are explained as compensations
for failures in this life. The famous view about the "death of God"
resulted
from his observations of the movement from traditional beliefs to a
trust of science and commerce. Nietzsche dissected Christianity and
Socialism as faiths of the "little men," where excuses for weakness
paraded as moral principles. John Stuart Mill's liberal democratic
humanism was for him a target for scorn and he called Mill "that
blockhead." His announcement of the death of God in <em>The Gay Science </em>can
be interpreted religiously or atheistically: "God is dead. God remains
dead. And we have killed him... What was holiest and most powerful of
all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives:
who will wipe this blood off us?..." </p>
<p>According to Nietzsche, the other world is an illusion, and instead of 
worshipping gods man should concentrate on his own elevation, which 
Nietzsche symbolizes in the <i>Übermench</i>. The contrast of 
 "good and evil" as opposed to that of "good and bad" Nietzsche 
associated with slave morality. He argued that no single morality can 
be appropriate to all men. The meaning of history was the appearance,
at rare moments, of the exceptional individual. And by creating the
figure of Zarathustra he presented the teacher of the coming superman.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"My first dose of Nietzsche shocked me
profoundly. In black and white he had had the audacity to affirm: 'God
is dead!' What? I had just learned that God did not exist, and now
someone was informing me that he had died."</b> (Salvador Dali in </font><i><font size="2">Diary of a Genius</font></i><font size="2">, 1966) </font></blockquote>

<p>First Nietzsche's works began to gain significant
public notice by Danish critic and scholar 
<a href="../../../brandes.htm">Georg Brandes</a>, who lectured on
Nietzsche at the University of Copenhagen in 1888. The philosophers
thoughts influenced among others Thomas Mann, Herman Hesse, André
Malraux, André Gide, Albert Camus, Rainer Maria Rilke, Stefan George,
Sigmund Freud, and Jean Paul Sartre. Bergson, like Nietzsche, developed
his own philosophy of the creative will. Although the Nazis used some
of the philosopher's ideas, Nietzsche was deeply opposed to the
collective tendencies that labelled National Socialism. Moreover, the
Nazis <span class="st">were not good readers in general&nbsp;&#8211; they burned books. </span></p><p>Nietzsche&nbsp;rejected
biological racism and German nationalism, writing "every great crime
against culture for the last four hundred years lies on their
conscience." Radical rightists, on the other hand, welcomed Nietzsche's
view of "Herrenmensch," a new type of man who with his
robber instincts was able to manipulate the masses and who was a
law unto himself. Adolf Hitler kept a bust of him and in 1943 gave his
works to Mussolini, who did not read them. When Elisabeth Nietzsche
died in 1935, Hitler participated in the funeral ceremony. The Nazis
built three years later a monument for Nietzsche. </p>
