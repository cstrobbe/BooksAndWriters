<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Rumanian-born American writer, who
was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1986. Basis for Wiesel's work
is his own experiences and personal
testament of the destruction of Jews during World War II. A survivor of
the horrors of the Holocaust, Wiesel has been considered "a messenger
to mankind... The message is in the form of a testimony, repeated and
deepended through the works of&nbsp; a great author." (in the Nobel
Peace citation) Central themes in Wiesel's fiction, memoirs, and essays
are the struggle against evil, "man's inhumanity toward man", and
silence versus verboseness. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"How can one work for the living
without by that very act betraying those who are absent? The question
remains open, and no new fact can change it. Of course, the mystery of
good is no less disturbing than the mystery of evil. But one does not
cancel out the other. Man alone is capable of uniting them by
remembering." </b></font><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">A
Beggar in Jerusalem</font></i><font size="2">, 1968) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Elie Wiesel was born in Sighet, Romania. "Sighet was a typical
shtetl, a sanctuary for Jews," Wiesel has said. It was also center for
Hasidic Jewish learning. Wiesel spent a happy childhood. He learned
Yiddish from his mother and father, and studied biblical Hebrew in
school. In 1944 all Jews from the town were moved to Auschwitz, where
his mother and younger sister were killed. Wiesel was sent to
Buchenwald, where his father was died shortly before Buchenwald's
liberation. Three children from the family survived, Wiesel was one of
them. </p>
      <p>In April 1945, having miraculously survived, Wiesel was
liberated by the U.S. Third Army. He was 16. After the war
Wiesel settled in France, and studied at Sorbonne literature,
psychology, and philosophy. His faith in God was shattered but during
the following years he found again Jewish traditions. From 1949 he
started to write for the Franco-Jewish newspaper <i>L'Arche</i>. In
1952 he became a reporter for the Tel Aviv newspaper <i>Yediot Ahronot</i>.
In 1956
he was sent to NewYork to cover the United Nations, and seven years
later he was naturalized. In 1969 Wiesel married Marion Erster Rose, a
survivor of the German concentration camps. She has translated Wiesel's
books into English. </p>
      <p>In his new home country, which he has shared with France and
Israel, Wiesel gave thousands of lectures at college campuses. He
taught at City College of New York
and at Boston University, where he was Andrew Mellon Professor of the
Humanities and from 1988 professor of philosophy. In 1992 Wiesel was
invited by presidents Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Milosevic of Serbia, to
observe the war ravaged cities. Wiesel's honors include Congressional
Medal of Achievement he received from President Ronald Reagan in 1984.
He has received honorary doctorates from dozens of universities, and he
is Commander of the French Legion of Honor. </p>
      <p>Although Wiesel yearned to be a writer after the war, he could
not gather the courage to recount what he had witnessed in the
concentration camps. He once asked, <font size="2"><font size="3">"How
can we imagine what is beyond imagination... How can we retell what
escapes language?"</font><strong> </strong><font size="3">Wiesel</font>
      </font>wrote a romantic spy novel under the pen name Elisha
Carmeli and travelled in India. In France he was encouraged by the
Nobel laureate <a href="mauriac.htm">François Mauriac</a> to write
about his experiences. This resulted in 1956 to the publication of
Wiesel's first book, an 800-page&nbsp;memoir <i>And the World Remained
Silent</i>, written originally in Yiddish. The semi-autobiographical
story appeared two years later abridged as <i>La Nuit</i> (Night),
Wiesel sent Mauriac a manuscript copy of the&nbsp;book, and&nbsp; later
said:&nbsp; "I owe him much.... That I should say what I had to say,
that my voice be heard, was as important to him as it was to me." <font size="2">(<em>Elie Wiesel: A Religious Biography</em> by Frederick L.
Downing, 2008, p. 103.) </font></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;La Nuit</em>&nbsp;became an international
best-seller. However, Mauriac's own publisher had doubted its success
&#8211;&nbsp;"No one's interested in the death camps anymore. It won't sell,"
was the verdict. Wiesel later said, that "not to transmit an experience
is to betray it." In <i>L'aube</i> (1960, Dawn)&nbsp;Wiesel
told&nbsp;of a survivor of the Nazi terror, who seeks to kill the
enemies of the nascent Jewish state of Israel. <i>Le Jour</i> (1961,
The Accident) was about another survivor who must deal with the guilt
at staying alive while his family had perished at Auschwitz. The book
formed a trilogy with <i>Night</i> and <i>Dawn</i>. A version of the
trilogy, <em>La Nuit</em>, <em>L'Aube</em>, <em>Le Jour</em> came
out in 1972. The daily cycle for the three works suggested hope, but
actually the movement from darkness to light is not
straightforwad.&nbsp; In <em>Dawn</em> the victim turns into a killer.
      </p>
      <p>In his books Wiesel has drawn on his early theological
training and used the Hasidic tradition. One of the central conflicts
in the novels, the doubt and belief in God, is embodied in the
enigmatic character of Moshe the Madman. God's silence in front of
suffering and the despair and hope of humanity is a recurrent theme. In
the second part of his memoirs, <i>And the Sea Is Never Full</i>
(1999), Wiesel wrote: "The silence of Birkenau is a silence unlike any
other. It contains the screams, the strangled prayers of thousands of
human beings condemned to vanish into the darkness of nameless, endless
ashes. Human silence at the core of inhumanity. Deadly silence at the
core of death. Eternal silence under a moribund sky." </p>
      <p>Most of Wiesel's novels take place either before or after the
events of the Holocaust. "When I see that it becomes tolerable, I don't
speak about it. That's why I have written so little about the
Holocaust." Wiesel writes to testify, and to justify his own
survival. <i>La Ville de la chance</i> (1962, The Town beyond the
Wall) deals with the silence of non-Jewish in front of the Holocaust. <i>Le
Mendiant de Jerusalem</i> (1968, Beggar of Jerusalem) is about the
Six-Day War. <i>Le Serment de Kolvillàg</i> (1973, The Oath) was about
a small town somewhere in the Carpathian Mountais, which only exists in
the memory of its last survivor, Azriel. His burden is to know the
story when a Christian boy disappeared and Jews were accused of ritual
murder. Moshe, a mystic, chooses assume the guilt and the community
takes the oath: whoever would survive never speak of the town's last
days and nights. "In the final stage of every equation, of every
encounter, the key is responsibility. Whoever says "I" creates the
"you." Such is the trap of every conscience. The "I" signifies both
solitude and rejection of solitude. Words name things and then replace
them. Whoever says tomorrow, denies it. Tomorrow exists only for him
who does not seek it. And yesterday? Yesterday is Kolvillàg: a name to
forget, a word already forgotten."<i> Le Cinquième fils</i> (1983, The
Fifth Son) is an exploration of good and evil. The narrator is the
stepchild of a survivor of the Holocaust, Reuven. He goes after an SS
officer, who had murdered Reuven's son<i>. Le Crépuscule, au loin</i>
(1987) asks the question, were the cultured henchmen of the Nazi era
truly sane people, and <i>L'Oublié </i>(1989, The Forgotten) is a
story of a journalist, who explores his own and his family's past. The
central characters are Elhanon Rosenbaum, a New York psychotherapist
and survivor of the Holocaust, who begins to suffer from Alzheimer's
disease, and his son, Malkiell, who travels to Romania, where his
father had fought with the partisans. </p>
      <p>Wiesel other works include <i>Célébration hasidique </i>(1972),
a collection of Hasidic tales, <i>Célébration biblique</i> (1975,
Messenger of God), a collection of biblical stories, <i>Silences et
mémoire d'hommes</i> (1989, Sages and Dreamers), and anthologies
of varied essays dealing with collective and individual quilt,
post-World-War-II Germany, the Klaus Barbie trial in France, the evils
of racism, and the Jewish faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;A three volume collection
of Wiesel's essays, entitled <i>Against Silence: The Voice and Vision
of Elie Wiesel </i>(edited by Irving Abrahamson) was published in
1985. <i>The Jews of Silence </i>(1966) and The <i>Testament</i>
(1981) dealt with the oppression of Jews under Communism. <i>Memoir in
Two Voices </i>(1966) was based on conversations between President
Francois Mitterrand and the author. In the book Mitterand defended his
collaboration with the anti-Semitic Vichy regime during World War II.
From the 1990s Wiesel has devoted much of his time to the publication
of his own memoirs and to organizing and participating in a number of
prestigious international conferences and events. The first part of his
memoirs, <i>All Rivers Run in to the Sea</i>,&nbsp;came&nbsp;out&nbsp;in
1995, and the second, <i>And the Sea is Never Full</i>, in 1999. </p>
