<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->German classical scholar and historian, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1903. Mommsen's best known work is <span style="font-style: italic;">Römische Geschichte </span>(3
vols. 1854-56). Although Leo Tolstoy's name was mentioned among the
most prominent candidates for the prize, the Nobel committee couldn't
accept his radical views, and Mommsen was the one awarded. Tolstoy died
in 1910 without receiving the most famous acknowledgment in literature.
</p>
<p>Mommsen's greatest interest was in Roman law, but he also
participated in contemporary politics. "Bismarck has broken the
nation's backbone," he wrote when Bismarck made Berlin the political
capital. "The injury done by the Bismarck era is infinitely greater
than its benefits... The subjugation of the German personality, of the
German mind, was a misfortune that cannot be undone." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Keine Kunde, ja nicht einmal eine Sage
erzaehlt von der ersten Einwanderung des Menschengeschlechts in
Italien; vielmehr war im Altertum der Glaube allgemein, dass dort wie
ueberall die erste Bevoelkerung dem Boden selbst entsprossen sei. Indes
die Entscheidung ueber den Ursprung der verschiedenen Rassen und deren
genetische Beziehungen zu den verschiedenen Klimaten bleibt billig dem
Naturforscher ueberlassen; geschichtlich ist es weder moeglich noch
wichtig festzustellen, ob die aelteste bezeugte Bevoelkerung eines
Landes daselbst autochthon oder selbst schon eingewandert ist."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Römische Geschichte</font></i><font size="2">, Book 1) </font></blockquote>
<p>Theodor Mommsen was born in Garding, Schleswig, but he&nbsp;grew up
in Oldesloe (now Bad Oldesloe), a spa in Holstein 45 kilometers from
Hamburg. His father, Jen Mommsen,&nbsp;was a Protestant minister.
Sophie Krumbhaar, his mother, came from Altona.&nbsp; Bcause there was
no money to send Theodor and his brothers Tycho and August to school,
they received&nbsp;their early education at home. Mommsen's father
encouraged&nbsp; his sons to read German classics,&nbsp;Latin texts,<strong> </strong>and
such authors as Victor Hugo, Byron, and William Shakespeare.&nbsp;His
only formal schooling Mommsen received at the Gymnasium Christianeum at
Altona, where he came into contact with literary romanticism and became
a radical liberal. </p><p>Mommsen studied philology and jurisprudence
at Kiel, and passed in 1843 the State Examination, which allowed him to
practice law. During these years he published a collection of poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">Liederbuch dreier Freunde</span>,
with his brother Tycho and Theodor Storm. Mommsen's poems from 1836-37
record his break with the Lutheran Christianity of his ancestors: "Erst
war ich Christ, / Darauf Deist, / Dann Atheist." Later he declared of
being "homo minime ecclesiasticus." After graduating from Kiel he
worked for a year as a teacher in a boarding school in Altona. From
1844 to 1847 Mommsen pursued archaeological studies in Italy, where his
aim was to find and collate unpublished Latin inscriptions. In 1848 he
became a professor of law at Leipzig University. During the revolution
of 1848 he edited a liberal newspaper, the <i>Schleswig-Holsteinische Zeitung</i>.</p>
<p>In 1851 Mommsen was dismissed from his post&nbsp;for
having&nbsp;participated in an uprising in Saxony. Though notoriously
bad lecturer, he was appointed&nbsp; Professor of Roman Law at the
University of Zurich, where he wrote most of the<em> History of Rome</em>.
He then worked as professor of Roman Law in Breslau (1854-1858), after
which he&nbsp;served as&nbsp;professor of ancient history at Berlin
until his death. At the age of 41 he married Marie Reimer, the twenty
three year old daughter of&nbsp;his Leipzig publisher. They eventually
had sixteen children.&nbsp;</p><p>Mommsen&nbsp;served as a member of
the Progressive party in the state parliament of Prussia from 1863 to
1866 and again from 1873 to 1879. After the unification of Germany,
Mommsen sat in the German imperial parliament. In 1882 he was tried and
acquitted on a charge of slandering chancellor Otto von Bismarck
(1815-1898) in an election speech. In opposition to Bismarck, who
&nbsp;had said&nbsp;that "only a completely ready state can permit the
luxury of a liberal government," Mommsen wanted to combine national
unity with freedom (eine Synthese von Einheit und Freiheit). He had
been an ardent supporter of the unification process, but did not accept
its side effects, the bureaucratic centralism and uncritical obedience,
the "German slave mentality". </p><p>Mommsen also attacked the
anti-Semitism that he found among many of his colleagues. The
conservative nationalist, scholar and journalist Heinrich von
Treitschke published in 1879 a study on anti-Semitic movements, and
defended the natural rejection&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;inherent in the German
national psyche &#8211; of foreign influences. Next year Mommsen with over 70
influential figures protested against anti-Semitic incitement. He wrote
that Jews are Germans and that racist hatred will come to an end sooner
or later &#8211; not only religious tolerance will return to normal but there
will be real respect for the distinctiveness of the Jewish culture. </p>
<p>Mommsen produced an enormous quantity of texts &#8211; there are over 1
000 entries in the bibliography of his writings compiled by Karl
Zangemeister and Emil Jacobs in 1905. Mommsen was devoted to scientific
research and his profound knowledge of auxiliary science in historical
studies was unique. An influential figure, he was also able to arrange
his favorite students university appointments.&nbsp;From 1873-95 he was
permanent secretary of the Academy. Mommsen formed in 1853 the <span style="font-style: italic;">Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</span>, a project which still continues,&nbsp;and helped to edit the <span style="font-style: italic;">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</span>.
In addition,&nbsp;Mommsen himself edited several volumes of late
antique texts. Mommsen died on November 1, 1903, in Charlottenburg. </p>
<p>Mommsen's first three volumes of <i>The History of Rome</i>, written
in vigorous and lively style, spanned the Roman republic from its
origins to 46 B.C. The work brought Mommsen acclaim throughout Europe,
but he was also accused of "journalism": turning the real state of
affairs upside-down. In this and other works Mommsen boldly drew
parallels between modern times and ancient Rome. Egon Friedell sees in
his <i>Die Kulturgeschichte der Neuzeit</i> (1927-31) that in
Mommsen's hands Crassus becomes a speculator in the manner of Louis
Philippe, the brothers Gracchus are Socialist leaders, and the Gallians
are Indians, etc. </p><p>Mommsen never published the fourth part,
partly because he could not write the story of humankind under the
imperial authorities, it was alien to his "liberal republican
sentiment", and moreover, contemporary political issues did not provide
him the great constitutional themes he was concerned&nbsp; throughout
his life. And it has been said that the crucial issue was possibly his
negative&nbsp;stand towards Christianity. However, as a part of his
teaching responsibilities at Berlin University,&nbsp;Mommsen gave a
number of lectures on the history of Rome under the Emperors. The
manuscript for the final volume, was destroyed by fire in 1880. </p><p>Notes compiled by two of Mommsen's students on his lectures between 1863 and 1886 were later collected as <i>A History of Rome Under the Emperors</i>,
to give a view of Mommsen's interpretation of the imperial age. The
book, published in 1992 was considered a tremendous discovery. Mommsen
admired Gibbon's colorful <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>,
but his approach to the period was different &#8211; individual characters
did have a central place in his thought. With a few exceptions, all the
Emperors were ineffectual and dreadfully mediocre from Vespasian to
Diocletian, according to Mommsen. </p>
