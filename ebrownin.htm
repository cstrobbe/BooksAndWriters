      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English poet, the wife of
      <a href="../../../browning.htm">Robert Browning</a>, the most
respected and successful woman poet of the Victorian period. Elizabeth
Browning was considered seriously for the laureateship that eventually
was awarded to <a href="../../../tennyson.htm">Tennyson</a> in 1850.
Her greatest work, <em>Sonnets from the Portuguese</em> (1850), is a
sequence of love sonnets addresses to her husband. Browning's vivid
intelligence and ethereal physical appearance made a lifelong
impression to Ruskin, Carlyle, Thackeray, Rossetti, Hawthorne, and many
others. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What do we give to out beloved?</b></font>
        <b><br>
        <font size="2">A little faith all undisproved </font><br>
        <font size="2">A little dust to overweep, </font><br>
        <font size="2">And bitter memories to make </font><br>
        <font size="2">The whole earth blasted for our sake. </font><br>
        <font size="2">He giveth His beloved, sleep." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'The Sleep') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Elizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett was born at Coxhoe Hall,
near Durham. Her father was Edward Moulton-Barrett, whose wealth was
derived from sugar plantations in the British colony of Jamaica. Mary
Graham-Clarke, her mother, came from a family with similar commercial
interests. Elizabeth grew up in the west of England and was largely
educated at home by a tutor, quickly learning French, Latin and Greek.
Both parents supported her early writing and many of her birthday odes
to her parents and siblings still survive. At the age of 14, she wrote
her first collection of verse, <em>The Battle of Marathon</em>. It was
followed by<em> A Essay On Mind</em> (1826), privately printed at her
father's expense. Her translation of <em>Prometheus Bound</em> (1833)
with other poems appeared anonymously. Browning's first work to gain
critical attention was <em>The Seraphim, and Other Poems</em>(1838). </p>
      <p>In the early 1820s, she started to suffer from a mysterious
illness, as if there were a cord tied around her stomach "which seems
to break", as she said. The doctors found nothing wrong with her
gynecologically, but she was long an invalid, using morphine for the
pains for the rest of her life. At that time, laudanum or morphine was
commonly prescribed for many illnesses. Her drug habit also helped her
to cope with family problems. However, once she confessed: "Opium &#8211;
opium &#8211; night after night! &#8211; and some evenings even opium won't do". In
1832 the Barrett family moved to Sidmouth and in 1835 to London, where
she began to contribute several periodicals. Her family was still
wealthy, but after a lawsuit the property and slaves in Jamaica from
Edward Barrett's grandfather did not go directly in the hand of Edward
and his brother. The court decision favored their cousins, the Goodin
Barretts. In 1838, seriously ill as a result of a broken blood-vessel,
Elizabeth was sent to Torquay. After the death of her brother, who
drowned in Torqauy, she developed almost morbid fear of meeting anyone,
and devoted herself entirely to literature. For the death of her
brother she blamed herself. </p>
      <p>Elizabeth did not publish her picture in her books. Once she
described herself to a painter: "I am 'little &amp; black' like Sappho,
en attendant the immortality &#8211; five feet one high... eyes of various
colors as the sun shines... &amp; set down by myself (according to my
'private view' in the glass) as dark-green-brown - grounded with brown,
&amp; green otherwise; what is called 'invisible green' in invisible
garden fences... Not much nose of any kind; certes no superfluity of
nose; but to make up for it, a mouth suitable to larger personality &#8211;
oh, and a very very little voice."</p>
      <p>When her <em>Poems</em> (1844) appeared, it gained a huge
popularity and was praised among others by the American writer <a href="../../../eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. Elizabeth Browning's
name was mentioned six years later in speculations about the successor
of Wordsworth as the poet laureate. </p>
      <p>At the age of 38 she started a correspondence with the six
year younger poet Robert Browning, who knew well her work. "I love your
verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett," he said, and continued,
"I do, as I say, love these Books with all my heart &#8211; and I love you
too." Elizabeth had already expressed her admiration for Browning's <i>Bells
and Pomegranates</i> (1841-46); at that time many critics considered
his verse too obscure and difficult. Confined by ill health to her
bedroom, she did not expect to have a lover. After several hundred
letters, she finally agreed to meet him in May 1845. "There is nothing
to see in me, &#8211; nothing to hear in me," she said, "the rest of me is
nothing but a root, fit for the ground &amp; the dark." <br>
      </p>
      <p>Following their first meeting, Robert Browning proposed
marriage. The courtship was kept a close secret from her father, who
had forbidden all 12 of his sons and daughters to marry. Next year she
ran away from her home. In September 1846 she married Robert Browning
in a church near Wimpole Street. Since then they hardly ever spent a
night apart. The couple settled a week later in Florence. Casa Guide
became the base of their life, although the Brownings also visited
Rome, Siena, Bagni di Lucca, Paris, and London. She suffered a
miscarriage in March 1847 and a year later another. Her only child,
Robert Wiedemann (known as Penini), was born in 1849. At that time she
had kicked her morphine and ether habit for a period. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Elizabeth Barrett Browning became supporter of Italian
independence movement, which she advocated in <em>Casa Guidi Windows</em>
(1851). She also opposed slavery in<em>&nbsp;The Runaway Slave at
Pilgrim's Point</em> (1849) and in the political&nbsp;<em>Poems Before
Congress</em> (1860). Browning's family had treated their slaves well.
Her magnum opus,<em>&nbsp;Aurora Leigh</em> (1857), was a novel in
blank verse about a woman writer, her childhood and pursuit of a
literary career. It also dealt such themes as the poet's mission,
social responsibilities, and the position of women. <em>Last Poems</em>
(1862), issued posthumously, contained some of her best-known lyrics. </p>
      <p>In her late years, Elizabeth Barrett Browning developed an
interest in spiritualism; a subject which Robert Browning did not
consider intrinsically important. Robert was unnerved by his wife's
increasing drug dependency. She ate less and
less, giving her food away under the table to their spaniel. All her
friends noticed the change in her, the smudged eyes and the extreme
slightness of her figure. <span class="st"><em></em></span>When
Nathaniel Hawthorne met her in the summer of 1858, he found her "a
pale, small person, scarcely embodied at all . . . It is wonderful to
see how small she is, how pale her cheek, how bright and dark her
eyes." Elizabeth Barrett Browning died, romantically, in her husband's
arms on June 29, 1861, in Florence. On the day of the funeral, a crowd
of Italians, English, and Americans followed her coffin from to the
Protestant cemetery in the Piazzale Donatello. Shops were shut as a
mark of sorrow. </p>
      <p>After her death the writer Edward FitzGerald expressed no
sorrow in his famous letter: ''Mrs. Browning's Death is rather a relief
to me, I must say: no more Aurora Leighs, thank God! A woman of real
genius, I know; but what is the upshot of it all? She and her Sex had
better mind the Kitchen and their Children: and perhaps the Poor:
except in such things as little Novels, they only devote themselves to
what Men do much better, leaving that which Men do worse or not at
all.'' Among her best known lyrics is <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>
&#8211; the 'Portuguese' being her husband's petname for the dark-haired
Elizabeth; there are no Portuguese originals in the love poems. Its
title could also refer to the series of sonnets of the 16th-century
Portuguese poet Luiz de Camões, which details the last thoughts of a
maiden Catarina, who is dying in the absence of her lover. Browning's
suggestion for the title had been "Sonnets translated from the
Bosnian". She composed the sonnet sequence during her affair with
Robert Browning and shortly before their marriage. </p>
      
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Nay, if there's room for poets in
this world </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">A little overgrown (I think there is), </font><br>
        <font size="2">Their sole work is to represent the age, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Their age, not Charlemagne's. </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>The <i>Sonnets</i> first appeared in a collected edition in
1850. The most famous piece, Sonnet No. 43 begins with the well-known
line, "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways". </p>
