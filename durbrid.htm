<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English tv, radio, and mystery writer, whose 
best known series character is Paul Temple and his wife Steve. Durbridge 
was the master of the cliffhanger and one of the most successful writers 
for television. However, the first radio detective in England was 
probably Inspector Hornleigh, whose adventures were heard in <i>Monday 
Night at Seven</i> (1937-40) and who appeared in three films between 1939-41. In the 
Unites States, the first popular radio detective series was <i>Detectives Black and Blue
</i> from 1931. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"By Timothy!"</b></font><font size="2"> (Paul Temple's catchphrase)</font></blockquote>  

<p>Francis Durbridge was born in Hull, Yorkshire. He was educated 
at Bradford Grammar School, where he was encouraged to write by an English teacher. 
While he was still a 
student, Durbridge had in 1933 a radio play broadcasted by the BBC.  
Durbridge studied English at Birmingham University, and after graduating in 1933, he 
worked as a stockbroker's clerk, before becoming a full-time writer.  
In 1940 he married Norah Elizabeth Lawley; they had two sons. At the age of 26, Durbridge created the character of 
Paul Temple. The first book, <i>Send for Paul Temple</i> (1938), 
a collaboration with John Thewes, was a novelization of radio serial. </p>

<p>Durbridge wrote Temple 
stories for BBC from 1938 to 1968. 
He was played by  Hugh Morton in <i>Send for Paul Temple</i> (1938), <i>Paul Temple and the 
Front Page Men</i> (1938), and 
<i>News of Paul Temple</i> (1939), and then, over the years by Carl Bernard, Richard Williams, 
Barry Morse, Howard Marion 
Crawford, Kim Peacock, and Peter Coke, beginning from <i>Paul Temple And The Gilbert Case</i> (1954). 
Coke's portrayal of the detective is perhaps the best known. 
Steve Trent, 
a Fleet Street journalist and later Temple's wife, was played by Marjorie Westbury from the fifth serial; 
she continued up through 1968. The introductory and closing music from Vivian Ellis's  'Coronation Scot' added greatly to the 
popularity of the radio series. In Finland, the theme song was  'The Devils Gallop' by Charles Williams. </p>
<p>The characters became hugely popular in Britain and Temple's adventures were followed in many counties, 
among others in Germany, where Albert Lieven gained recognition in several adaptations of Durbridge's 
crime thrillers. However, Temple's four film appearances  in the 1940s and 1950s are considered insignificant. 
John Bentley, who became a B-movie star in the 
black-and-white  mysteries,  was the hero in <i>Calling Paul Temple</i> (1948), <i>Paul Temple's Triumph</i> (1950), 
and <i>Paul Temple Returns</i> (1952), based on <i>Paul Temple Intervenes</i>.  The 
<i>British Monthly Film Bulletin</i> characterized this production as a "slickly-made, American style thriller". 
Christopher Lee played the killer, whose country 
home is filled with art and reptiles. All these films were directed by Maclean Rogers and made 
at the Nettlefold studios. The <i>Cinema</i> 
magazine concluded that  a Temple film without Bentley was "as unthinkable as Quo without Vadis", but his 
greatest success he achieved in the role of Hugh Mortimer in the television series <i>Crossroads</i>. 

Anthony Hulme  played the novelist and amateur sleuth in <i>Send for Paul Temple</i> (1946), directed by 
John Argyle. In the 1960s, 
Durbridge created for TV a new series character, Tim Frazer, starring Jack Hedley. Frazer was an 
undercover agent and  also appeared  in three books. Durbridge wrote the series with Clive Exton, 
Charles Hatton, and Barry Thomas. </p>
<p> Dialogue dominates usually in Durbridge's novels, which sometimes reveal that they were 
originally written for radio or television. His characters belong to the middle-class and have 
much time to devote themselves in solving crimes &#8211; or planning them. The protagonist is 
sometimes a suspect, who tries to free himself from the web of intrigues. In the film <i>The 
Vicious Circle </i>(1957) an actress is found dead in Dr Latimer's flat and the weapon turn 
up in the boot of his car. Then another body is found and again all the clues lead to Latimer. 
In the story <i>12 Past 12</i>, filmed in Germany under the title <i>Piccadilly, Null 
Uhr Zwolf</i> (1963), the young Edgar Wallace helps to solve a crime. </p>
<p>Durbridge published 35 novels, several of them were based on his tv or radio series. 
Some of his books were written in collaboration with other writers, among them John Thewes, 
<a href="ruthef.htm">Douglas Rutherford</a>, and Charles Hatton. Paul Temple was credited as the 
author of his own adventures, two of which Durbridge wrote with Rutherford. <i>The Broken Horseshoe 
</i>(1952) and <i>Operation Diplomat</i> (1952) were Durbridge's first TV thriller serials. They were  
produced live in a studio at Alexandra Palace. In 1997, Alan Bleasdale created his own version of 
Durbridge's 1960s BBC serial <i>Melissa</i>,  in which a war correspondent, Guy Foster, falls in 
love with a beautiful but mysterious Melissa. Bleasdale described the mystery detective story as 
his "homage and tribute to one of this country's finest thriller writers." </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">Paul Temple: </font></b><font size="2">One of the most successful 
detective characters ever created for broadcasting. Paul Temple is former reporter and 
playwright, who then becomes a successful novelist and criminologist, helping 
Scotland Yard. He solves 
mysteries with his wife, who changed her name from Louise Harvey to Steve Trent after 
a gang of diamond thieves murdered her brother, a Scotland Yard superintendent. &#8211; 
Temple had a thirty-year career on radio, 
and continued his adventures 
also in books from 1938 to the late 1980s.  Two of the novels, </font><font size="2"><i>The Tyler 
Mystery</i></font><font size="2"> and </font><font size="2"><i>East of Algers</i></font><font size="2"> 
list Temple as the author. A Paul Temple comic strip, which lasted for 
two decades, was begun in 1951. Its artists 
included Alfred Sindall, Bill Bailey, and John Namara. &#8211; 
The BBC television series <i>Paul Temple, Detective</i> from 1968, written by 
Durbridge and starring John Bentley and 
Dinah Sheridan, ran for twelve episodes. <i>Paul Temple</i>, which ran from 1969 to 1971, was one of 
BBC's first color productions. Francis Matthews portrayed Paul Temple and Ros Drinkwater was Steve. </font><b><font size="2">Other radio series heroes</font></b><font size="2">: Harry Lime (produced
