<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Italian writer and one of the pioneering figures in the feminist movement, best-known for her diary novel <I>Quaderno proibito</I> (1952). In her works de C&eacute;spedes drew attention to the woman's position in the family, which she saw as particularly problematic. Her protagonists are frustrated women who struggle with their identities and the narrow roles assigned them. Irene and Adriana, the two friends in the novel <I>Between Then and Now</I> (1956), want to live on their own terms in spite of family expectations&nbsp;– but they also recognize that life might be easier with a husband who pays the bills. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"'... You know, I'd like to pick up my life like a parcel and dump it in somebody's arms and say, "Now you think about it." But it's never possible, we've pulled down our own destruction upon us. Every morning you find life heavy on your shoulders and you have to start reasoning again. Pietro says that reason sets us free, but that isn't true: reason everlastingly confronts us with ourselves. That's a good joke!'"</B> (in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Between Then and Now)</FONT></I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Alba de C&eacute;spedes was born in Rome&nbsp;into a wealthy and&nbsp;influential family.&nbsp;She was the daughter of&nbsp;Laura Bertini y Alessandri,&nbsp;an Italian, and&nbsp;doctor Carlos Manuel de C&eacute;spedes y Quesada&nbsp; (1871–1939)<STRONG>,</STRONG> a Cuban ambassador, writer, and President of Cuba in 1933. His father Carlos Manuel de C&eacute;spedes del Castillo (1819-1874),&nbsp;called Padre de la Patria,&nbsp;made the declaration of Cuban independence and was&nbsp;appointed in 1869 President of the Republic of Cuba in Arms. De C&eacute;spedes never met her famous grandfather, who died long&nbsp;before she was born. Noteworthy, De C&eacute;spedes supported Fidel Castro and attended in 1968 the centennial of&nbsp;the Grito de Yara, which began Cuba’s struggle for independence from Spain. However, the Communist regiment considered her an agent provocateur and cencored her writings. </P><P>Raised in a bilingual home,&nbsp;De C&eacute;spedes&nbsp;spoke both Spanish and Italian, but wrote most of her works in her mother's native&nbsp;langue.&nbsp;At the age of fifteen, she married Giuseppe Antamoro; they had one son. After divorcing him in 1931, she moved to Rome. De C&eacute;spedes later married Francesco Bounous, an Italian diplomat, and&nbsp;followed her husband to&nbsp;his posts in different parts of the world. Before&nbsp;moving to&nbsp;Italy with her own family, she lived in Paris, Washington, and Havanna. From the 1960s, following the publication of <EM>Il rimorso </EM>(1967, Remorse), she&nbsp;settled in Paris, where she lived until her death. </P><P>De C&eacute;spedes started to write poetry and plays in her childhood, and by 1935 her stories started to appear in Italian magazines. In the 1930s she worked as a journalist,&nbsp;contributing to&nbsp; <I>Epoca</I>, where she had her own column, and served as the editor of the literary section of <I>La Stampa</I>. Overstressed and unable to write books, she went to the editor in chief of <EM>La Stampa</EM>, and said to him, "Fire me, please do me this favor." </P><P>De C&eacute;spedes's early novels, including&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM>L'anima degli altri (</EM>1935), attracted little attention. <SPAN class=st><EM>Nessuno torna indietro</EM> </SPAN>(1938, There's No Turning Back), which&nbsp;sold by 1943 over 150,000 copies,&nbsp;and <EM>La fuga</EM> (1940) were banned by the fascist censors, but brought her worldwide recognition. Due to her writing, de C&eacute;spedes was interrogated at the Ministry of Popular Culture several times.&nbsp;According to the censors&nbsp; <EM>There's No Turning Back </EM>did not adequately reflect a "Fascist ethic"<SPAN class=st>. "The main interest in this book for English readers who want&nbsp;more than highly&nbsp;coloured 'romance'&nbsp; will&nbsp;lie in the considerable contrast between its chief characters and their equivalents in this&nbsp;country", said the reviewer for the<EM> Times Literary Supplement</EM>. </SPAN>&nbsp;</P><P>During the German occupation of Italy in World War II, de C&eacute;spedes and her husband crossed Axis lines and worked with the partisan Radio Partigiana in Bari. Her code-name on the program "L'Italia combatte" was Clorinda. "I am your Clorinda," she used to say on the radio, "here is your Clorinda talking to you...." Following the collapse of Fascism, she returned to Rome, where she founded in 1944&nbsp;the literary magazine <EM>Mercurio. </EM>It published works from modern Italian writers, such as <A href="moravia.htm">Alberto Moravia</A>, <A href="montale.htm">Eugenio Montale</A> and Elio Vittorini. De C&eacute;spedes edited <I>Mercurio</I> for four years.&nbsp; </P>
<P>
After the war she became one of the most translated Italian writers&nbsp;– English translations in particular made her work known to feminist readers. In 1953 her fan mail totalled several hundred letters a week. De C&eacute;spedes herself&nbsp;&nbsp;refused the label "feminist," arguing that "Personally, I have nothing against men and I do not need anyone to free me. If we are talking about equality at work and equal pay, then I agree, but when one talks about sexual freedom, well, I have to laugh. Women have always been free, sexually. (<FONT size=2><EM>Writing Beyond Fascism: Cultural Resistance in the Life and Works of Alba De Cespedes</EM> by Carole C. Gallucci and Ellen Victoria Nerenberg, 2000, p. 53.) </FONT>In her native country she was often ignored by male critics who considered her economically and effectively written novels superficial. </P><P>De C&eacute;spedes&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;eight novels, four collections of short stories, and three collections of poems, two plays, and screenplays. Her friends included the novelist and poet Cesare Pavese, whose&nbsp;novella,&nbsp;<EM>Tra donne sole</EM>,&nbsp;she<STRONG> </STRONG>adapted to the screen with Suso Cecchi D'Amico. Some crucial changes were made&nbsp; in the original story. In the novella, one of the characters kills herself out of disgust for the pointlessness of her life, but in the&nbsp;screen version&nbsp;she&nbsp;drowns herself for unrequited love. The film was directed by <A href="antonion.htm">Michelangelo Antonioni</A>. </P><P>Among&nbsp;de&nbsp;C&eacute;spedes's&nbsp;central works is&nbsp;<EM>Dalla parte di Lei</EM> (1949, The Best of Husbands),&nbsp;the story of a woman accused of murder.&nbsp;It presented a strong feminine protagonist, a type which was not very common in Italian literature. At the end she shoots her <SPAN class=st>unattentive </SPAN>husband, a young university professor, instead of killing herself.&nbsp;"In piling most of the evidence and all of the sympathy on her heroine's side, she writes like a shrewd attorney for the plaintiff, but reads, finally, like a somewhat shallow judge of human relations." <FONT size=2>(<EM>Time Magazine U.S.</EM>,&nbsp;Dec. 29, 1952)</FONT> </P><P><EM>Quaderno proibito</EM> (1952, The Secret) is a novel presented in a diary form, in which the&nbsp;narrator,Valeria Cossati, analyzes her needs and small everyday disappointments.&nbsp;Valeria has two grown-up children, Riccardo and Mirella, and a husband who creates his career in a bank. She works in an office, falls in love with the manager, Guido, and blames her husband and children for stifling her. Discontent with her life, she leaves Guido and burns her notebook, feeling that her remaining days will be empty and cold. The novel was also reworked as a play and a TV drama. </P>
<P>Irene, the protagonist&nbsp;of <SPAN class=st><EM>Prima e dopo</EM> </SPAN>(1956, Between Now and Then), rejects safe bourgeois marriage to pursue her career as a journalist.&nbsp; After much pain and suffering, she&nbsp;comes to terms with&nbsp;her freedom. "'It seems impossible, but really it's just these material, practical things that make you realize you exist,' I told myself. 'You don't know you're born until you are faced with bills for which you're directly responsible...'"&nbsp; <EM>Remorse</EM>,&nbsp;compared by some reviewers to <A href="beauvoir.htm">Simone de Beauvoir</A>'s roman &agrave; clef, <EM>The Mandarins</EM>,&nbsp;told&nbsp;of a group of&nbsp;intellectuals and dealt with the significance of past actions. The work expressed a profound disappointment with postwar Italy: "... seeing Italy in the hands of the Christian Democrats is certainly not a beautiful thing, at least as far as I am concerned," she said in an interview.<EM><STRONG> </STRONG></EM></P><P><EM>La bambalona</EM>&nbsp;(1967) was narrated in third person, from the point of view of Giulio, a bachelor lawyer in Rome. Giulio is ruined by his love for a much younger woman of a lower social class, "la bambalona" of the title. The reviewer for the<EM> Times Literary Supplement</EM> said of de C&eacute;spedes's story that "... perhaps sharing her hero's philosophy that 'the only real authentic activity for a man is to empty all his strength into the womb of a young woman', she has poured over her <EM>pasticcio all'italiana</EM> a quite unneccessary sauce ot other stories of love and sex. The result is indigestion." The comic actor Ugo Tognazzi played the role of Giulio in the film adaptation of the book. A volume of poetry, <SPAN class=st><EM>Chansons des filles de mai</EM></SPAN> (1969), was inspired by the events of May '68 in Paris, which de C&eacute;spedes witnessed. The poems were written in French and later translated into Italian by the author. De C&eacute;spedes died&nbsp;on November 14, 1997, in Paris. </P>
