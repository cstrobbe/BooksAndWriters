<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Finnish social anthropologist, philosopher,
and sociologist, whose area of specialization was the history of
marriage, morality, and religious institutions. Westermarck gained
international fame with his doctoral thesis, <span style="font-style: italic;">The History of Human Marriage</span>, which was inspired by the ideas of <a href="darwin.htm">Darwin</a>
and Herbert Spencer. Westermatck attacked on the theory of primitive
promiscuity, and sought to demonstrate that the matriarchate was not a
stage of human development and that universal promiscuity was a myth.
The study appeared first in 1891, and later in three volumes in 1922. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Long ago I sat one day in a library where I had come upon the three volumes of E.A. Westermarck's </b></font><b><i><font size="2">The History of Human Marriage</font></i><font size="2">.
Browsing through its pages, I kept chuckling and I know some other
denizens of the library must have thought me off my rocker to be
finding something at which to laugh in what was a dusty tome. Yet there
is nothing more amusing than man and his customs, and in that case it
was some studies of marriage by capture."</font></b><font size="2"> (the Western writer </font><a href="lamour.htm"><font size="2">Louis L'Amour</font></a><font size="2"> in </font><i><font size="2">Education of a Wandering Man</font></i><font size="2">, 1989) </font></blockquote>

<p>Edvard Westermarck was born in Helsinki (Helsingfors), the son of
Nils Christian Westermarck, who taught Latin at the University of
Helsinki, and the former Constance Gustava Maria Blomqvist, the
daughter of the University librarian and professor of the History of
Learning. As a child Westermarck suffered from chronic catarrh.
Although he could not take part in games and sports at school, he later
showed physical toughness in his strenuous expedition journeys in North
Africa. </p>
<p>Westermarck was educated at the Swedish lyceum. After graduating in
1881, he entered the University of Helsinki, receiving his doctor's
degree (Ph.D.) in 1890. He also worked as a teacher at the university.
At the age of 25 he learned English in order to study the works of
Darwin, Morgan, Lubbock, and McLennan in the original language. This
was exceptional, because academic circles in Finland were oriented
toward Germany and toward idealism, not Anglo-Saxon empiricism and
naturalism. </p>

<p>As a result of a visit to England in 1887 and studies at the British
Museum, Westermarck wrote his dissertation, the first six chapters of <i>The Origins of Human Marriage</i>.
The whole book, published in 1891 with a foreword by Alfred Russel
Wallace, was an immediate scientific success. It launched his life's
work to investigate the institution of marriage. Westermarck himself
never married or had a family. According to some sources, his sexual
orientation was well-known in London, but he never had to experience a
public ostracism like Oscar Wilde. </p>
<p> In England Westermarck spent much of his time in Surrey, where he
was well acquainted with English men of letters, such as Edmund Gosse;
the philosopher and psychologist James Sully became his intimate
friend. They had met earlier in Norway by chance when walking in the
mountains. "This was the beginning of an acquaintance to which I have
owed much in my life," he later said. </p>
<p>The period between 1900 and 1902 Westermarck lived mostly in Morocco
but he also constantly moved between Finland and Britain. From 1907 to
1931 Westermarck acted as professor of sociology at the London School
of Economics and Political
Science. At the same time he was professor of practical philosophy at
the University of Helsinki (1906-1918). For a number of years he
devoted the summer term to the School of Economics and the rest of the
year to his investigations in Morocco and his work in Helsinki. In 1918
he moved to Turku, where he had been appointed professor of philosophy
and rector at Åbo Akademi, the Swedish-speaking university ofTurku. A
famous Swedish-speaking Finn, Westermarck also participated in the
negotiations concerning Åland in the League of Nations and published
the article 'The Aaland Question' in <i>Contemporary Review</i> in 1920. </p>

<p>The two-volume <span style="font-style: italic;">The Origin and Development of Moral Ideas</span>
(1906-08) was an attempt to "scientificize" moral philosophy. His
conclusion Westermarck based on anthropological, ethnological and
historical data. "Could it be brought to people that there is no
absolute standard in morality," he wrote, "they would perhaps be
somewhat more tolerant in their judgments, and more apt to listen to
the voice of reason." The Finnish philosopher <a href="gwright.htm">Georg Henrik von Wright</a> considered it the most important philosophical work ever written by a Finn. </p>
<p>Westermarck thought that morality is a social phenomenon and can be traced to altruistic 
and objective feelings of approval and disapproval, according to social rewards. Westermarck 
argued against the view that moral judgments are universal facts or common to all people. 
They are a product of a long period of development, and ultimately based upon emotions and 
vary in different individuals. </p>
<p>Westermarck's rational and critical approach to religion was noted by <i>Prometheus</i>, 
the freethinkers' association founded in 1905 &#8211; he served its  chairman for some time. 
In his youth Westermarck had read Mill's essays on religion, which influenced deeply his 
thinking. He remained an agnostic the rest of his life. </p>
 

<p> Westermarck was also one of the first sociologist to 
examine, why human beings are so modest about their sexuality. 
In the essay <span style="font-style: italic;">The Origins of Sexual Modesty</span> (1921) he 
saw that sexual shame is only a by-product of an Darwinian adaptation, 
the natural instinct of aversion to incest, which has led to the veiling of the sexual function itself. 
He had suggested already in his doctoral thesis, that men are disposed to find their their mothers 
and sisters sexually unattractive. An innate aversion to later close sexual attraction and bonding 
develops between individuals living together from early childhood. Freud's Oedipal theory about 
inherent incestuous desires was 
in direct contrast to the Westermarck effect, which  is considered nowadays more accurate explanation of human behavior. </p>
 
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Christianity and Morals</span>
(1939), Westermack's final philosophical work, was born partly as a
reaction against views that the "modern world owes its scientific
spirit to the extreme importance which Christianity assigned to the
possession of truth, of <i>the</i> truth." The credit for progress,
according to Westermarck, should be attributed to the Enlightenment.
Considered too radical, the book was not published in Finnish until
1984, although it had already been translated during the Continuation
war (1941-44). In <i>Christianity and Morals </i> Westermarck also
represented tolerant views towards homosexuality. "Among mammals the
male possesses useless nipples, which occasionally even develop into
breasts, and the female possesses a clitoris, which is merely a
rudimentary penis, and may also develop. So, too, a homosexual tendency
may be regarded as simply the psychical manifestation of special
characters of the other sex, susceptible of being evolved under certain
circumstances, such as may occur about the age of puberty. Thus the
sexual instinct of boys and girls shows plain signs of a homosexual
tendency, and is often more or less undifferentiated. When facts of
this kind become more commonly known, they can scarcely fail to
influence public opinion about homosexuality."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Christianity and Morals</font></i><font size="2">)  </font> </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The patient and impartial search after
hidden truth, for the sake of truth alone, which constitutes the
essence of scientific research, is of course the very opposite of that
ready acceptance of a revealed truth for the sake of eternal salvation,
which has been insisted by the Churches."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Christianity and Morals</font></i><font size="2">, 1939) </font></blockquote>
<p>Westermarck made several travels in Morocco from 1897. After an absence of ten years, he returned 
in 1923, and eventually bought a house on the outskirts of Tangier. The last visit he made to Morocco was in 1938-39. 
 Among his most important Moroccan informants was Abdessalam El-Baqqali, 
whose family belonged to the Andrja tribe. He followed Westermarck to London and visited also Sweden and Finland. 
With a Swedish woman, whom 
El-Baqqali had met in his youth, he corresponded for decades.  
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Sex år i Marocco: reseskildringar</span> (1918) 
Westermarck devoted one chapted to his friend. </p> 

<p>

Westermarck's field study methods in social anthropology were based on 
primary research, field work and  
and comparative approach. 

He learned Arabic and many Berber dialects, and summarized, along 
 with a proverb, that "Honey is 
not fat, sorghum is not food and Berber is not a language." 

The observations of his studies were recorded in <span style="font-style: italic;">Marriage Ceremonies in Morocco</span> (1914), <span style="font-style: italic;">Ritual and Belief in Morocco</span> (1926), <span style="font-style: italic;">Wit and Wisdom in Morocco</span>, and other now classical books. 
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ethical Relativity </span>(1932) Westermarck attacked the idea that moral principles express objective value. He argued 
that moral judgments can be taken as arguments about the speaker's feelings, but this relativism does not lead to 
subjectivism, because moral feelings must be altruistic. His six lectures on the history of customs,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tapojen historia</span> (1913), 
were translated into Finnish by the writer <a href="joell.htm">Joel Lehtonen</a>. This book introduced first time Westermarck's ideas to the Finnish speaking public. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">"<b>Onpa sangen merkillistä ajatella, että
työt keskeytetään ja kaupat pidetään suljettuina eräänä päivänä joka
viikko vielä meilläkin sen vuoksi, että ihmiset tuhansia vuosia sitten
uskottelivat, että taivaankappaleet tekevät eräinä aikoina työn
tuloksettomaksi tai vaaralliseksi. Syynä tähän omituiseen ilmiöön on
osaksi ulkonnollinen pyhitys, jonka maagillisiin käsityksiin perustuva
tapa on saanut, mutta osaksi myöskin se seikka, että yksi lepopäivä
viikossa on nähty hyödylliseksi tahi tarpeelliseksi nykyaikaisessa
kiirehtivässä ja kilvoittelevassa yhteiskunnassa. Vanha tapa säilyy
siis hyödyn nojalla, jota se todella on tuottanut.</b>"<b> </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Tapojen historia</font></i><font size="2">, 1913</font><font size="2">)</font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"> </font></blockquote>

<p>Westermarck died on September 9, 1939, in Tenhola. His travels in
Morocco preindicated the rising interest
of the literary expatriates in the country, among others Paul Bowles.
The Westermarck Society was founded in 1943. Its publications include
the journal <i>Sosiologia </i>(Sociology), <i>Acta Sociologica</i>, and <i>Transactions of the Westermarck Society</i>
series. In Finland Westermarck's work influenced a number of scholars,
among them Rafael Karsten, who studied Inca culture in Peru, Gunnar
Landtman, who studied Papuans in New Guinea, Hilma Granqvist, Yrjö
Hirn, and Rolf Lagerborg, a relentless critic of Christianity. Violet
from Berhard Shaw's play <i>Man and Superman </i>(1905) has been
called a modern, self-conscious woman, who had read Westermarck. The
famous anthropologist and sociologist Claude Lévi-Strauss considered
him "the last and most famous representative of the English
Anthropological School; he embodied, with an exceptional, militant
power, a current of thought which renewed our social and moral
understanding, and out of which grew the first efforts to develop a
comprehensive description of mankind." </p>
