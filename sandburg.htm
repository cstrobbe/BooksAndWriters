<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American poet, historian, novelist and
folklorist, 'the singing bard'. In his work Sandburg gave voice to the
people of the Midwestern. He was a central figure in the 'Chicago
Renaissance' and he played a significant role in the development in
poetry that took place during the first two decades of the 20th
century. His emphasis on the tradition of American experience associate
him with Hart Crane and Robinson Jeffers. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>these people of the air, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">these children of the wind, </font><br>
<font size="2">had a sense of where to go and how, </font><br>
<font size="2">how to go north north-by-west north, </font><br>
<font size="2">till they came to one wooden pole, </font><br>
<font size="2">till they were home again. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from <i>The People, Yes</i>, 1936) </font>

</blockquote>
<p>Carl Sandburg was born in Galesburg, Illinois,  the son of poor
Swedish immigrant parents. His father was August Sandburg, a blacksmith and
railroad worker, who had changed his name from Johnson. His mother was the
former Clara Anderson.  Sandburg was educated at public school until he was thirteen, and he then worked
 in odd jobs in Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. In 1898
he returned to his home town for a short time with the trade of 
house-painter. </p>
 
<p>One of Sandburg's favorite stories was that he was rejected by West
Point because he failed the test in arithmetic and grammar. When the
Spanish-American War broke out in 1898, Sandburg enlisted in the 6th
Infantry, but saw no combat. Upon his return he entered Lombard college
in Galesburg, studying the Classics. During these years he worked as a
janitor and as a 'call man' on the Galesburg fire department.
Encouraged by professor Philip Green Wright, Sandburg started to write
poetry. His first book,<span style="font-style: italic;"> In Reckless Ecstasy</span>, was printed privately in 1904. </p>
<p>Just short of receiving his degree in 1902, Sandburg moved to Wisconsin. He held various jobs, working as traveler 
for a stereoptican slides firm, labor organizer for the Wisconsin 
Social-Democrats, and as a journalist  on the Milwaukee <i>Leader</i>.
He also was involved in the presidential campaign of Eugene V. Debs. In
1908 he married Lillian Steichen, a fellow socialist and a
schoolteacher, the sister of the noted photographer Edward Steichen,
whose biography Sandburg was to write. At the time they first met,
Sandburg had not been a member of a socialist organization, but Lillian
had attended socialist meetings and encouraged him in his work as an
organizer. "This is an <span style="font-style: italic;">age of action</span> &#8211; not of dreaming or contemplation or gratulation," she wrote in one of her letters.<font size="-1"> (see <span style="font-style: italic;">The Poet and Dream Girl: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">The Love Letters of Lilian Steichen &amp; Carl 
Sandburg</span></font><font size="-1">, edited by Margaret Sandburg, 1987)</font>
From 1910 to 1912 Sandburg was secretary to the Socialist mayor of
Milwaukee. Like Theodore Dreiser and a number of other writers and
artists, Sandburg was considered a security risk by J. Edgar Hoover and
F.B.I. kept a dossier on him. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I'm an idealist. I don't know where I'm going but I'm on the way."</b></font></blockquote>
 
<p>In 1913 Sandburg moved with his family to a suburb of Chicago. He was employed as  an editor of a
business magazine, and published articles in the <i>International Socialist 
Review.</i> His poems started to appear in Harriet Monroe's (1860-1936) magazine <i>Poetry: A Magazine of Verse</i>. 
The Levinson Prize, awarded by <i>Poetry </i>in 1914, established Sandburg as an important new figure in the literary scene. 
In 1918 Sandburg visited Sweden, where he met a cousin named Erik Carlson and received from 
King Gustav VI a special medal for his achievements.   
Upon his return he was questioned 
by Federal authorities, who accused him of supporting the Bolsheviks
in Russia. However, though Sandburg shared the dream of workers paradise where all people were equal
with such writers as Jack London, Upton Sinclair and John Reed,
he was not a political thinker and he soon
became the voice of men and ideals of the Midwestern. He did not like
being labelled as a socialist for he did not accept all socialist
ideas. "What <span style="font-style: italic;">kind</span> of a socialist?" he would ask.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>Sandburg's first major collection of poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chicago Poems</span>,
came out in 1916. It presented the poet as a loud-voiced, proud
proletarian, full of joy of life. The book included the famous
'Chicago' and 'Fog.' "Hog Butcher for the World, / Tool Maker, Stacker
of Wheat, / Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;
Stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders.../"<font size="2"> (from 'Chicago')</font> Sandburg was too old to serve in the army during World War I, but he went abroad to serve as a foreign correspondent. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Cornhuskers</span> (1918) Sandburg documented his war experiences. Upon his return, in 1919, he  joined the staff of the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> for thirteen years. In his articles he dealt among others garment trades and in 1919 appeared another series of articles in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Chicago Race Riots</span>.
His free verse, reflecting industrial America, gained wide popularity
during the Depression years, although his use of everyday language at
first shocked readers. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the 1930s Sandburg became active in the Socialist movement.
Interested in American folksongs, he published in 1927 a collection in <span style="font-style: italic;">The American Songbag</span> and later <span style="font-style: italic;">New American Songbag </span>(1950).
These songs Sandburg had heard from railroad men, cowboys, lumberjack,
hobos, convicts and workers on farm and in factory. Outside industrial
cities was the prairie, of which he wrote: "I was born on the prairie,
and the milk of its wheat, the red of its clover, the eyes of its
women, gave me a song, a slogan." </p>

<p>Between the wars Sandburg travelled widely as a poetry-reciter,
accompanying himself on a guitar, wearing a blue working man's shirt
and his white hair rumpled. On the lecture tours, his most prominent
competitor was Robert Frost, four years older than Sandburg. They met
in 1917, Sandburg called him "the strongest, loneliest, friendliest
personality among the poets today." The good-natured Sandburg remained
his friend for nearly fifty years, in spite of Frost's constant attacks
on his person and his literary production. When Sandburg performed at
Michigan, Frost said: "His mandolin pleased some people, his poetry a
very few and his infantile talk none." </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The People, Yes</span> (1936) is
probably Sandburg's most popular single book. From his very first
volumes Sandburg recorded the speech of Midwesterners, spoken by the
working class of the industrial cities; this became a clear feature of
his poetry. It also showed the author's epigrammatic skills. Sandburg
was often called the successor to <a href="wwhitman.htm">Walt Whitman</a>;
the both writers were fascinated by the rhythms of the urban life and
admired common laborers, but they also had a kind of shamanistic streak
in their expression. </p>
<p>Sandburg's
life of Lincoln was published in six volumes (1926-1939) and although
historians have criticized its mistakes, it was praised for  its style and readability. Edmund Wilson's wisecrack in 
<i>Patriotic Gore </i> (1962) is perhaps the most fierce attack on the work: "The cruellest 
thing that has happened to Lincoln since he was shot by Booth has been to fall into the hands of Carl 
Sandburg."  <span style="font-style: italic;">Abraham Lincoln: The War Years</span> (1939, 4 vols.) won the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for history. 
It traced Lincoln's career from the time of his departure for the White House, to May 4, 1865. 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Abe Lincoln Grows Up</span> (1928) was written for young readers, and was drawn from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Prairie</span> (1926). 
Sandburg's  autobiographical
works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Always the Young Strangers</span> (1953) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ever the Winds of Change</span> (1983). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">BE READY </font><br>
<font size="2"><b>Be land ready </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">for you shall go back to land. </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Be sea ready </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">for you have been nine-tenths water </font><br>
<font size="2">and the salt taste shall cling to your mouth. </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Be sky ready </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">for air, air, has been so needful to you </font></b><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><b><font size="-1"> </font><br>
<font size="2">you shall go back, back to the sky. </font></b><font size="2"><br>
(from <i>Wind Song</i>, 1960)</font></blockquote>
<p>In 1928 Sandburg moved to Harbert, Michigan, and in 1943, seeking a
milder climate, the family moved again, this time to Connemara, a farm
in Flat Rock, North Carolina. The Greek Revival-style house, which
remained his home forthe rest of his life, had been built by C.G. Memminger, one of South's great attorneys and advocates of equal education, in 1838-1839.  <br>
</p>
      <p>During World War II Sandburg wrote a 
folksy syndicated newspaper column for the <i>Chicago Times</i>.
From 1945 he lived as a writer and farmer, breeding goats and combining
poetry reading with folk singing. In 1960, Sandburg earned $125,000 for
working as a creative consultant on a Hollywood film, <i>The Greatest Story Ever Told</i>.
Its production was postponed in 1961. "This picture will be made,"
Sandburg declared before returning to Flat Rock, "and it will be a
great all-time picture." Eventually it was released in 1965, directed
by George Stevens and starring Max von Sydow. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sandburg's surprising sojourn was not his first experience with Hollywood: when he was a motion-picture critic for the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>,
he had done interviews with stars of the silent film. And D.W. Griffith
had planned to produce a movie about Lincoln based on Sandburg's books,
but engaged Stephen Vincent Benét to write the screeplay. At the age of
sixty-five, Sandburg began his first and only novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Remembrance Rock</span>,
an epic saga of America, which appeared in 1948. Sandburg died on July
22, in 1967, at the age of 89. He once said: "It could be, in the grace
of God, I shall live to be eighty-nine, as did Hokusai, and speaking my
farewell to earthly scenes, I might paraphrase: 'If God had let me live
five years longer I should have been a writer.'" </p>
