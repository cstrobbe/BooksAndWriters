<P>Persian (Iranian)-born British writer, whose novels and short stories are largely concerned with people caught in the social and political upheavals of the 20th century. 
Central themes in Lessing's work are feminism (see also <A href="beauvoir.htm">Simone de Beauvoir</A>, Betty Friedman, Germaine Greer, Marilyn French), 
the battle of the sexes, individuals in search of wholeness, and the dangers of technological and scientific hubris. Doris Lessing was awarded the 
Nobel Prize for Literature in 2007. Since 1949, she has lived in England but she is also considered an African writer because she grew up and was 
educated in Zimbabwe (former Rhodesia).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"When I was first in England I was disturbed all the time in my deepest sense of probability because the sun went down at four in the middle of an active afternoon, filling a cold, damp, remote sky with false pathos. Or, at eleven in the morning, instead of blazing down direct, a hand's span from centre, it would appear on a slant and in the wrong place, at eight o'clock position, a swollen, misshapen, watery ghost of a thing peering behind chimney-pots. The sun in England should be feminine, as it is in Germany." </B>(from <EM>Going Home</EM>, 1957) </FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Doris Lessing spent her early childhood in Kermanshah, Persia (now Iran). Her English-born father, Alfred Cook Tayler, who had lost his leg 
and health in World War I, was a bank clerk with the Imperial Bank of 
Persia. Emily McVeagh, Lessing's mother,
had been trained as a nurse. After the war the Tayler's moved to Kermanshah and later Tehran. In the mid-1920s the family 
bought with their life savings a maize farm in the district of Banket, in the Lomagundi area of Southern Rhosesia, where Lessing grew up with her younger brother Harry. Her childhood was lonely, 
the nearest neighbours were miles away and there was no real roads between the farms. </P>

<P>In 1926 Lessing was sent to a convent school in Salisbury (now Harare), where the Roman Catholic teachers tried to 
convert her from the family's Protestant faith. "I was cripplingly homesick," 
Lessing later said. 
She left the Girls' High School at the age of fourteen and then earned her living as a nursemaid, telephone operator and clerk. 
At nineteen she married 
Frank Wisdom, a civil servant; they had two children. The marriage ended 
in 1943. For some years Lessing was an active member of the Communist Party, which was formally banned in Southern Rhodesia. This period of her 
life is reflected in<EM> A Ripple from the Storm </EM>(1958) of the five-volume sequence <I>Children of the Violence</I>, the first four of which were set in a 
fictional African colony, Zambesia. 
In 1943 Lessing married the German political activist Gottfried Lessing, a member of the inner circle of the Rhodesian Communist Party. He was the model for 
Anton Hesse in <I>A Ripple from the Storm</I> and Willi Rodde in <EM>The Golden Notebook</EM> (1962). 
Gottfried Lessing became later the German ambassador to Uganda; 
he and his third wife were murdered in the 1979 revolt against Idi Amin. </P>
<P>Lessing's second marriage also failed and in 1949 she moved to England with her youngest child and the manuscript of her novel. "I had two marriages behind me, but I did not feel I had been<EM> really</EM> married," she&nbsp;wrote in her autobiography.&nbsp;For a short period she shared with a South African woman a large flat&nbsp;in which two rooms were let to prostitutes.This experience&nbsp;provided material for the play <EM>In Pursuit of the English</EM> (1961).&nbsp;Lessing's first novel, <I>The Grass is Singing, </I>came out&nbsp;in 1950. Set in Rhodesia, the story focused 
on a poor white farm woman, Mary Turner, and her weak husband. She has a relationship with her African servant, Moses, 
who eventually kills her. The novel was attacked in South Africa and Rhodesia. </P>
<P>From the 1950s onwards Lessing supported herself and her son by writing. 
Disillusioned with Communist policies and disgusted at the one-sidedness&nbsp;of Communist literary criticism, Lessing left the party in the mid-1950s. She underwent 
Jungian analysis and also studied Sufism under the guidance of Idres Shah. In 1979 
Lessing set up a Sufi Trust for one hundred thousand dollars.</P>

<P>Many critics consider 
<I>Children of Violence</I>, Lessing's semi-autobiographical series of novels about Martha Quest, 
her most substantial work. <EM>Four-Gated City </EM>(1969), the last volume, closes
with Martha's death in destroyed world at the end of the twentieth century. It has been said 
that <I>Children of Violence</I> and more <I>The 
Canopus in Argos </I>reflect the influence of Sufist thought on Lessing's literary work 
and concern with the union of the soul with a Higher 
Being. </P>

<P><EM>Diary of a Good Neighbor </EM>(1983) and <EM>If the Old Could</EM> (1984) were 
published under the name Jane Somers to 
dramatize the problems of unknown writers. The use of a pseudonym also 
helped Lessing to experiment again with different type of fiction. </P>

<P>Lessing has written poems, plays, and several science fiction novels. One of her most widely read and translated works is 
<I>The Golden Notebook</I>, an experimental novel, which was greeted upon its publication as a landmark of the Women's Movement. 
The story deals with the personal 
crisis of a writer, Anna Wulf, who keeps four notebooks while working on her fictional novel 'Free Women'. The 'yellow notebook' 
portrays Anna's alter ego, the 'red' is a political document, the 'blue' is a diary, and the 'black' is about Anna's earlier life. In the final section Anna gives 
the 'golden notebook' to her American lover. The 'Free Woman' narrative ends with Anna's acceptance that she cannot 
capture the absolute truth about herself in her notebooks. </P>
<P><EM>Briefing for a Descent into Hell</EM> (1971) was&nbsp;written in a 'stream of conscious' style, and <EM>Memoirs of a Survivor </EM>(1974) 
portrayed the breakdown of society. The film version of <I>Memoirs of a Survivor</I> (1981) was directed <FONT size=2></FONT>by David 
 Gladwell, starring Julie Christie, Christopher Guard, Leonie Mellinger, Debbie Hutchins. "Christie emerges as a fine character player 
despite her still potent attractiveness," wrote Derek Elley in <I>Variety Film Guide </I>(2000). "Director David Gladwell 
apparently did not have the budget to give a more solid look to the degenerating city." </P>
<P><EM>The Good Terrorist </EM>(1985) examined with irony a militant left-wing life style and the short distance between idealism and 
terrorism. "Kindly, skilled people watched, and waited, judging when people (like herself, like Pat) were ripe, could be really 
useful. Unsuspected by the petit bourgeois who were in the thrall of the mental superstructure of fascist-imperialistic Britain, the 
poor slaves of propaganda, were these watchers, the observers, the poor people who held all the strings in their hands. 
In factories, in big industries&nbsp;– where Comrade Andrew wanted her, Alica, to work; in the civil service (that was just the 
place for Comrade Muriel!); in the B.B.C., in the big newspapers&nbsp;– everywhere in fact was this network, and even in little 
unimportant places like these two houses, Nos 43 and 45, just ordinary squats and communes. Nothing was too small to be 
overlooked, everyone with any sort of potential was noticed, observed, treasured... It gave her a safe, comfortable 
feeling."<FONT size=2> (from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>The Good 
Terrorist</FONT></I><FONT size=2>)</FONT> Alice, the protagonist, sees 
herself as a committed revolutionary. She knows how to confront officials, spray paint slogans, but she really does not have an 
understanding of political movements. When explosives are stored under her own roof, she cares more about curtains than issues. 
As Alice tries to change the house in a genuine commune, she becomes the mother of parasitic companions. </P>
<P><EM>Love, Again </EM>(1966) was set in the theatre world. The protagonist is an older woman, manager of a small 
theatre company, whose self-analysis runs in parallel with a new production. <EM>The Fifth Child </EM>(1988) was a mixture of genres 
from mythology to Mary Shelley's <I>Frankenstein</I>.&nbsp;In the story&nbsp;a middle-class English family 
is torn apart by the arrival of their fifth offspring, a monster, an untimely Neanderthal. The sequel to the novel, <EM>Ben, In the World</EM> (2000), portrayed the&nbsp;angry young monster trying to find an answer to the question, who he is. <EM>African Laughter&nbsp;</EM> (1994) was an 
account of Lessing's four visits to Zimbabwe between 1982 and 1992. </P><P><EM>Mara &amp;Dann </EM>(1999), set thousands of years in 
the future, tells of a brother and sister in a world full of violence and adventures. Its sequel was<EM> The Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog</EM> 
(2006).<EM> 
The Sweetest Dream </EM>(2002) was a family story, in which Frances Lennox struggles in life with her two sons 
and her ex-husband, a phoney Communist. The last part of the book focused on Sylvia, the daughter of Johnny's 
second wife, who works as a doctor in Zimlia, a thinly veiled Zimbabwe. "But while the novel ends on an 
affecting note that attests to Ms. Lessing's undimmed talent for social and psychological observation, even 
this achievement cannot erase the memory of the lugubrious and unconvincing pages that have taken so long to 
get there."<FONT size=2> (Michiko Kakutani in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>The New York 
Times</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, February 1, 2002) </FONT></P>
<P>The first volume of Lessing's autobiography, <EM>Under My Skin</EM> (1994), depicted her childhood in Zimbabwe.<EM> 
Walking in the Shade </EM>(1997) covered the years from 1959 to 1962. In<EM> Alfred &amp; Emily </EM>(2008) Lessing returned to the 
story of her parents in the second half of the book; the first half played with the idea of what would their life be like if WW I had never occurred. </P>

<P>Lessing has also collaborated with the composer 
Philip Glass on an opera based on the 

novel <I>The Making of the Representative for Planet 8</I>. Besides the Nobel Prize, Lessing's several literature awards 
include the Somerset Maugham Award (1956), the Shakespeare Prize of the West German Hamburger Stiftung (1982), the 
Austrian State Prize for European Literature (1982), the Palermo Prize (1987), the Premio Internaziolane Mondello (1987), and the W.H. Smith Award (1986). 
However, Lessing refused an offer of becoming a Dame of the British Empire on the grounds that there was no British Empire.
