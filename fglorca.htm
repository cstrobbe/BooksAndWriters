<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Spanish poet and dramatist, a
talented artist and a member of the 'Generation of 1927', a group of
writers who advocated avant-gardism in literature. After a period of
great creative activity, García Lorca was shot by Falangist soldiers in
the opening days of the Spanish Civil war. In both his drama and poetry
García Lorca balanced between the traditional and the modern, between
mythology and contemporary cultural trends. García Lorca's best-known
works include the play <i>Blood Wedding</i> (prod. 1933) and the poem <em>Lament
for the Death of a Bullfighter</em> (1935). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Most of the Madrid critics praised
the literary and dramatic merit of </b></font><b><i><font size="2">Marina
Pineda</font></i><font size="2"> to an extent that surprised me. In
general they asserted that it was more than just promising; it was real
achievement by a playwright who brought to the theatre a technique
aware of the limitations of historical drama and abundance of poetry
that flowed naturally and continuously, not only from the characters
but also from their surroundings. They found in it an emotional power
highlighted as much in the tragic phrases of Marina Pineda as in the
sweet and sorrowful worlds of the little nuns when they set out toward
the scaffold. This concept of </font><i><font size="2">Marina Pineda</font></i><font size="2"> is the one that satisfies me most, because I sincerely
believe that theatre is not and cannot be anything but emotion and
poetry - in word, action, gesture." </font></b><font size="2">(García
Lorca in </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights on Playwrighting</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Toby Cole, 1961) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Federico García Lorca was born at Fuente Vaqueros, a village
on the banks of the River Genil,&nbsp;some ten&nbsp;miles from Granada
and thirty miles from the Mediterranean. His father, Federico García
Rodriguez, was a prosperous farmer, who owned hundreds of acres of land
in and around Fuente Vaqueros. Vicenta Lorca Romero, García Lorca's
mother, had been a schoolteacher before becoming Federico's second
wife. Both of his parents loved music; his father played the guitar
while his family sang. When Lorca was eleven, the
family&nbsp;moved&nbsp;to Granada. In his poems and plays he returned
to the speech and customs of the rural society, which he regarded as
the true&nbsp;foundation of his work. </p>
      <p>García Lorca first read law at the University of Granada, but
later entered the University of Madrid. At the same time he also
studied music and composed his own piano pieces. In the 1920s García
Lorca collaborated with Manuel de Falla, becoming an expert pianist and
guitar player. In 1919 he moved to Madrid, where he lived at the
Residencia de Estudiantes, the intellectual center of the town. </p>
      <p>García Lorca's friends included the writers <a href="jimenez.htm">Juan Ramón Jiménez</a> and Pablo Neruda. With the
Catalan painter Salvador Dalí and the film director Louis Buñuel he
worked in different productions. Dalí and Lorca had met in 1923. From
the beginning, Lorca was fascinated by the young Catalan's personality
and looks. Also Dalí had admitted that Lorca impressed him deeply. "The
poetic phenomenon in its entirety and 'in the raw' presented itself
before me suddenly in flesh ad bone, confused, blood-red, viscous and
sublime, quivering with a thousand fires of darkness and of
subterranean biology, like all matter endowed with the originality of
its own for." <font size="2">(in <i>Secret Life</i>) </font>When
Buñuel and Dalí made their famous short film <i>Un Chien Andalou</i>
(1928), García Lorca was offended: he thought that the film was about
him. Lorca's friendship with Dalí inspired a poem, 'Ode to Salvador
Dalí', which was at the same time a defense of modern art and&nbsp;an
expression of love and devotion: "But above all I sing a common thought
/ that joins us in the dark and golden hours. / The light that blinds
our eyes is not art. / Rather it is love, friendship, crossed swords."</p>
      <p>Before the publication of his first collection, García Lorca
was already known as a poet, especially through his recitals of his
texts. As a writer García Lorca made his debut with <em>Libro de poemas</em>
(1921), a collection of fablelike poems. His first book had been a
travelogue, <em>Impresiones y paisajes</em> (1918). </p>
      <p>Upon earning a degree in law in 1923, García Lorca&nbsp;turned
his back to&nbsp;a university career.&nbsp;From his childhood on, he
had been drawn to theatre and music.&nbsp;The crucial moment in his
literary career was folk music festival Fiesta de Cante Jondo in 1922,
where he found inspiration for his work from the traditions of folk and
gypsy music. <span class="st"><em>Poema del cante jondo</em><strong> </strong></span>(1931,
Deep Song), written already in 1921, and <span class="st"><em>Primer
romancero gitano</em></span> (1924-1927, The Gypsy Ballads), published
in 1928, made García Lorca <i>the</i> poet of Andalusia and its gipsy
subculture. In these works he used old ballads and mythology to express
his tragic vision of life. Following the oral tradition, he read often
his poetry aloud, with great effect. Many poems circulated from hand to
hand before they were printed. </p>
      <p>After finishing <em>Mariana Pineda</em>, García Lorca wrote
in 1926 <i>The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife</i>. Its first performance
was in 1930. "In my <i>Shoemaker's Wife</i> I sought to express &#8211;
within the limits of ordinary farce, and without laying hands on the
elements of poetry within my reach &#8211; the struggle of reality with
fantasy that exists within every human being. (By fantasy I mean
everything that is unrealizable.) The shoemaker's wife fights
constantly with ideas and real objects because she lives in her own
world, in which every idea and object has a mysterious meaning which
she herself does not know. She has only lived and had suitors on the
other bank of the river, which she cannot and will not ever be able to
reach." 
      </p>
      <p>In 1927 García Lorca gained fame with his romantic historical
play <em>Marina Pineda.</em> Its scenery was constructed by Salavador
Dali and the distinguished actress Margarita Xirgu played the heroine.
By 1928, with the publication of <i>The Gypsy Ballads</i>, he was the
best-known of all Spanish poets, and leading member of the 'Generation
of 27', which included Luis Cernuda, Jorge Guillen, Pedro Salinas,
Rafael Alberti, and others. In 1929-30 García Lorca lived in the city
of New York, on the campus of Columbia University. </p>
      <p>Unable to speak English,&nbsp;García Lorca suffered a deep
culture shock, the collapse of his personal world, but also witnessed
the stock market crash. His suicidal mood was recorded in posthumously
published&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Poeta en Nueva York</em></span>
(1940, Poet in New York), in which he praised <a href="wwhitman.htm">Walt
Whitman</a>. The poet condemns the frightening, physically and
spiritually corrupted city, and escapes to Havana to experience the
harmony of a more primitive life. However, in his early letters to home
he expressed his enthusiasm about contemporary American plays. And he
was fascinated by the music and dance of the Harlem community. He did
not get the opportunity to meet Langston Hughes, who was attracted to
his poetry. When Hughes visited Spain during the Civil War, Lorca was
already dead. He worked for nearly twenty years with Lorca's brother
and the poet's mother to translate <em>The Gypsy Ballads</em> into
English. However, the version which came out in 1951,&nbsp;is
incomplete: only the first fifteen poems are translated. </p>
      <p>After a short visit to Cuba, García Lorca was back in Spain by
1931, and continued with theatre productions. He became the head the
traveling theatrical company, La Barraca, which brought classical plays
and other dramas to the provinces. After the death of his friend, a
bullfighter, García Lorca wrote <i>Lament for the Death of a
Bullfighter</i> (1935). It has been regarded by most critics as his
greatest poem. The work is divided into four sections, whose individual
motifs are weaved together. The figure of one man facing his fate, was
exemplified by his friend Ignacio Sánchez Mejías. Mejías himself had
written a surrealistic play and he was well-known in the literary
circles. He was killed while attempting to make a comeback in the
bullring. "Now Ignacio the well born lies on the stone. / All is
finished. What is happening? Contemplate his face: / death has covered
him with pale sulphur / and has placed on him the head of a dark
minotaur." (The rituals and codes of a bullfight, a distinct part of
the Spanish heritage, were later adapted to Western movies by such
directors as Budd Boetticher and Sergio Leone.)</p>
      <p>García Lorca's experiments in the theater &#8211; he rebelled
against the realistic theater of the middle class &#8211; involved such
puppet plays as&nbsp;<em>Los Títeres de Cachiporra</em> (prod. 1923)
and <em>El retablillo de Don Cristóbal</em> (prod. 1935). In 1933 he
wrote two surrealistic dramas, <span class="st"><em>El público</em></span>,
an attack on commercial theater and the entire social order, and<em> </em><span class="st"><em>Así que pasen cinco años</em></span>, an allegory of
lost time. <i>Mariana Pineda</i> (prod. 1927) was García Lorca's only
historical drama. Its central character, a Spanish national heroine,
was a historical figure &#8211; she was executed for embroidering a
revolutionary flag. The play portrays her as a martyr to liberty and
love: "I am freedom because love wanted it so; / Pedro! the freedom for
which you left me. / I am freedom stricken by men / Love, love, love
and eternal solitudes." <em>El amor de Don Perlimpín con Belisa en su
jardín</em>, written in 1931, was a farce, but it ended in death. "Take
me by the hands, my love, / for I come quite badly wounded, / so
wounded by love's going. / So wounded. / Dying of love!" The first
version of the surrealistic drama <em>El público</em>&nbsp;(The
Audience) Lorca finished in 1939. The play remained unpublished until
the 1970s &#8211; it dealt with homosexual love, a taboo subject on the
Spanish stage for many years. </p>
      <p><i>Blood Wedding</i>, the first part of García Lorca's famous
rural trilogy, was performed in 1933. The love triangle, blending drama
and poetry, closely resembled a classical Greek tragedy, in which death
hovers over the whole play. There is no escape from love, death or
fate: "The fault is not mine / The fault belongs to the earth." <i>Yerma</i>,
the second part, performed in 1934, portrayed a deadly conflict in a
barren marriage. The heroine strangles Juan, her husband, who do not
understand her yearning to love and bear children. <i>The House of
Bernarda</i>, written just before García Lorca's death in 1936 and
published in 1945, depicted a tyrannical mother, Bernarda Alba, and her
daughters. The youngest daughter commits suicide over her lover, Pepe
el Romano, who is engaged to Angustías, the oldest daughter. </p>
      <p>García Lorca's central themes are love, pride, passion and
violent death, which also marked his own life. The Spanish Civil was
began in 1936 and García Lorca was seen by the right-wing forces as an
enemy. The author hid from the soldiers but he was eventually found. An
eyewitness has told that he was taken out of a Civil Government
building by guards and Falangists belonging to the 'Black Squad'.
García Lorca was shot in Granada on August 19/20 of 1936 without trial.
The circumstances of his death are still shrouded in mystery. He was
buried in a grave that he had been forced top dig for himself.
Accroding to some sources, he had to be finished off by a <i>coup de
grâce</i>. One of his assassins later boasted, that he shot "two
bullets into his arse for being a queer." Most probably, García Lorca
wrote under pressure his last words on a note for a member of the
'Black Squad': "Father, please give this man a donation of 1000 pesetas
for the Army." Don Federico, his father, carried the note in his wallet
for the following years. He died in voluntary exile in New York. </p>
