      <p>British naturalist, who revolutionized the
science of biology by his demonstration of evolution by natural selection.
Darwin's <span style="font-style: italic;">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</span>,
was published on November 24, 1859, and
sold out immediately. It was followed by five more editions in his
lifetime.
The expression "survival of the fittest" did not originate from
Darwin's work. Herbert Spencer had already used it in his books about
evolutionary philosophy. Though Darwin described our common ancestor as
"a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears," Darwin did
not do so in the famous <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The presence of a body of
well-instructed men, who have not to labor for their daily bread, is
important to a degree which cannot be overestimated; as all high
intellectual work is carried on by them, and on such work material
progress of all kinds mainly depends, not to mention other and higher
advantages." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Descent of Man</font></i><font size="2">, 1871)
</font></blockquote>
<p>Charles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury. His grandfather Erasmus
Darwin was a scientist, whose ideas on evolution anticipated later
theories. His chief prose work was <i>Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life</i>
(1794-96). Darwin's maternal grandfather was Josiah Wedgewood, the
founder of the famous pottery works. Due his background, Darwin was not
expected to work for a living but use his education and talents well. </p>
<p>Darwin's mother died when he was eight years old, and he was brought
up by his sister. In 1827 he started theology studies at Christ's
College, Cambridge. His love to collect plants, insects, and geological
specimens was noted by his botany professor John Stevens Henslow. He
arranged for his talented student a place a on the surveying expedition
of HMS Beagle to Patagonia. Captain Robert FitzRoy needed a naturalist
to serve as his companion and messmate on the tedious trip. Despite
objections of his father, Darwin decided to leave his familiar
surroundings. On the voyage, Darwin shared the small cabin with
FitzRoy; they were constantly engaged in quarrels. </p>
<p>The voyage took five years from 1831 to 1836. Darwin had good
reasons to doubt the view that fossils were relics of Noah's Flood and
in Cambridge he had participated in discussions about the
"transmutations" of species. Darwin returned with observations he had
made in Teneriffe, the Cape Verde Islands, Brazil, the Galapagos
Islands, and elsewhere. He never set foot abroad again. During the
voyage, he had contracted a tropical illness, which made him a
semi-invalid for the rest of his life. By 1846 Darwin had published
several works based on the discoveries of the voyage and he became
secretary of the <i>Geological Society</i> (1838-41). </p>
<p>From 1842 Darwin lived at Down House, Downe. In 1839 he had married
his cousin Emma Wedgwood, and when not devoting himself to scientific
studies, he led a life of a country gentleman. He seldom left his
house. Later in life he studied how earthworms improve soil fertility
and structure, and the consequences of inbreeding. Following the death
of his daughter Anne in 1851, which had a devastating impact on him,
Darwin began to suspect that marriage between near relations could be
injurious. His son George concluded in his study <span style="font-style: italic;">Marriages Between First Cousins in England and Their Effects</span> (Journal of the Statistical Society, 1875) that the ill-effects have been often much exaggerated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the 1840s Darwin worked on his observations of the origin of
species for his own use. He began to conclude, although he was deeply
anxious about the direction his mid was taking, that species might
share a common ancestor. When Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist
living in the East Indies, sent in 1858 to Darwin his study containing
the main ideas of the theory of natural selection, Darwin arranged his
notes, which were presented to the Linnean Society, on July 1st, 1858.
They were read simultaneously with Wallace's paper, but neither Darwin
or Wallace was present on that occasion. Darwin's youngest son had
contracted scarlet fever and died; he was buried on the day of the
meeting. </p>
<p>Wallace, who was  self-taught and a highly decent man, never showed any jealousy and fiercely defended Darwin's theory. 
Wallace also campaigned for women's suffrage and land nationalization. </p>
<p>Darwin's great work, <i>The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</i>,
appeared next year, and was heavily attacked because it did not support
the depiction of creation given in the Bible. Before Darwin, the French
anatomist and botanist Jean-Babtiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) had
stressed the variations in species, and had given in his books an
account of human development that was plainly evolutionary in spirit.
Darwin's argument that natural selection <font face="Symbol">-</font> the mechanism of evolution <font face="Symbol">-</font>
worked automatically, leaving little or no room for divine guidance or
design. All species, he reasoned, produce far too many offspring for
them all to survive, and therefore those with favorable variations <font face="Symbol">-</font> owing to chance <font face="Symbol">-</font>
are selected. "I am actually weary of telling people that I do not
pretend to adduce [direct] evidence of one species changing into
another, but I believe that this view is in the main correct, because
so many phenomena can thus be grouped end explained."</p>
<p>At Darwin's hands evolution matured into a well-developed scientific theory, which have been a constant 
target of religious or pseudo-scientific attacks of "young-Earthers." Especially  in the United 
States  Christian fundamentalists have enjoyed some political success, but "creation science" has 
never found much support in Europe among  biologists.  In 1996 Pope John Paul stated that evolution is a 
well-established fact. </p>

<p>Darwin himself did not at first explicitly apply the evolutionary
theory to human beings. "You ask me whether I shall discuss man," he
wrote in 1857, "I think I shall avoid the whole subject, as so
surrounded by prejudice." Darwin rejected the idea of mixing religion
with science and wrote to the geologist Charles Lyell (1797-1875) in
1859, "I would give absolutely nothing for the theory of Natural
Selection, if it requires miraculous additions at any one stage of
descent." He also knew very well that his challenge to the Biblical
doctrine would cause stress to his friends and family, among them his
religious wife. </p>
<p>The popular view <font face="Symbol">-</font> after Darwin's hypothesis was accepted widely <font face="Symbol">-</font>
was that Man is descended from the apes which led Disraeli to say that
as between Man an ape or an angel, he was "on the side of the angels."
In a letter Darwin himself expressed his own doubts about his
revolutionary thinking: "Would any one trust in the convictions of a
monkey's mind...?" However, T.H. Huxley did not see any reason to
hesitate and published in his <i>Man Place in Nature</i> (1863) an application of the theory and Darwin followed him in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</span> (1871) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals</span>
(1872), which sold almost 5,300 copies on its first day. This work
showed the similarities between animals and man in the expression of
emotions and was the start of the science of ethnology. The remainder
of Darwin's books dealt with plants. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Insectivorous Plants</span> (1875) he explored how a plant - the sundew <font face="Symbol">-</font> catches, ingests, and digests flies. </p>
<i></i>
<p>Darwin's voyage with the Royal Navy's H.M.S. Beagle is recorded
in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Journal of Researchers</span>
(1836), a blend of scientific reporting and travel writing, one of the
best travel books ever written. Also Alfred Wallace wrote a travel
book, <i>The Malay Archipelago</i>. Darwin died in Down, Kent, on
April 19, 1882. It it thought that Darwin suffered from Chagas's
disease, when bitten by a Benchuga bug during his scientific studies in
South America. This would account for his fainting and other symptoms.
It has also been argued that Darwin's symptoms were psychosomatic.
Ocasionally he took ice cold baths or used "electric chains". </p>
<p>Darwin's works have had deep a influence also outside the field of natural sciences. Applied to politics it 
led to the talk about "favored races" and the doctrine that nations struggle in order that the fittest 
shall survive. Darwin himself once said: "Believing as I do that man in the distant future will be a more 
perfect creature than he is now, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient beings are doomed 
to complete annihilation after such long-continued slow progress. To those who freely admit the immortality of 
the human soul, the destruction of our world will not appear so dreadful." </p>
