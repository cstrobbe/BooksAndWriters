<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Indian political and spiritual leader,
called Mahatma ("Great Soul"). Gandhi helped India's struggle for
independence from Britain through a campaign based on nonviolence and
civil disobedience. His doctrine of nonviolent action had a profound
influence on Martin Luther King Jr., the leader of the civil rights
movement in the U.S, and Nelson Mandela, the most prominent figure of
the black opposition to apartheid in South Africa. However, Gandhi
never received the Nobel Peace Prize. Once, when he was asked what he
thought about western civilization, he
presumably replied that he thought it would be a good idea. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Nonviolence and truth (</b></font><b><i><font size="2">Satya</font></i><font size="2">) are inseparable and
presupposes one another. There is no god higher than truth."</font></b><font size="2"> (from <i>True Patriotism: Some Sayings of Mahatma Gandhi</i>,
1939, ed. by S. Hobhouse) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in Poorbandar, Kathiawar,
on the western coast of India. For several generations, the Gadhi's had
been Prime Ministers in several Kathiawald States. Karamchand Gandhi,
his father was the chief minister of Porbandar and a member of the
Rajasthanik Court. He married four times. Putlibai, his last wife and
Gandhi's mother, was a deeply religious Hindu.
When Gandhi was sixteen, his father died <font face="Symbol">-</font>
four years later he lost his mother. "The outstanding impression my
mother has left on my memory is that of saintliness," Gandhi later
wrote in his book of memoir, <i>An Autobiography: The Story of My
Experiments With Truth</i> (1927-29). </p>
      <p>Gandhi was married at the age of 13, as was not unusual by the
custom. Officially he was betrothed three times, but his first two
fiancees died. Gandhi's third bride, Kasturba Makanji, also 13, was the
only daughter of rich merchants. Kasturba and Gandhi had four sons;
their first child was born in 1885, but died after a few days. Kasturba
could not read or write and Gandhi's attempts to teach her were
fruitless. Although she often had to submit to her husband's decisions,
she also had a will of her own. The marriage endured until her death in
1944. </p>
      <p>In 1888 Gandhi went to London to study law, leaving his wife
for three years. While learning the law, he set to the task of making
himself an English gentleman. He was told it was necessary for him to
take lessons in dancing, French and elocution. In the new surrounding
Gandhi also began experiments with diet that continued throughout his
lifetime. After he was called to the bar at Inner Temple, he returned
home to practice as a barrister in Bombay. Unable to find a suitable
post, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893. During his journey to
Pretoria he had a firsthand experience with racist degradation, a most
crucial experience in his formative years. Gandhi worked for Dada
Abdullah &amp; Co and the Indian community. Kasturba had again waited
with the children in India, but in 1897 she joined her husband in
Durban. Gandhi gained fame as a tenacious political campaigner, who
courageously opposed the Transvaal government's discriminatory
legislation against Indian settlers. His ideological basis was much
derived from the liberal-humanist values he had absorbed in England,
exemplified in the works of Ruskin, <a href="thoreau.htm">Thoreau</a>,
and Emerson. </p>
      <p>Gandhi remained in South Africa for 20 years and developed a
system of non-violent defiance. During the Boer War (1899-1902) he
organized an Indian Ambulance Corps to assist the British, wrote
freelance field reports, and also contributed to Dadabhai Naroroji's<i>
India. </i>For his services he was awarded the War Medal. In the
Transvaal, he established the Phoenix Farm settlement, an attempt at
communal living along the lines of Leo Tolstoy's estate at Yasnaya
Polyana. <i>Indian Opinion</i>, a weekly from Durban originally
launched by two of Gandhi's friends in 1903, became a medium for his
thoughts. </p>
      <p>After the birth of their fourth son, Gandhi suggested to his
wife that they sleep in separate beds. Gandhi's one-sided decision and
sexual abstinence caused Kasturbai for a long time much stress. In
search for spiritual development Gandhi studied the <i>Bible</i>, the <i>Koran</i>,
and memorized the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>. Also <a href="ltolstoi.htm">Leo
Tolstoy</a> influenced him deeply. Gandhi saw that his methods were in
harmony with Hindu doctrines of <i>ahimsa</i> and that "the strongest
physical force bends before moral force when it is used in the defense
of truth."&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In his middle thirties, Gandhi took the vow of <i>bramahcharya</i>,
which means not only complete chastity but the elimination of sexual
desire. To test his self-control Gandhi slept naked with young women.
On his return trip from England to South Africa, he composed <i>Hind
swaraj</i>, an updated glimpse of dharma, on the stationery of RMS <i>Kildonian
Castle</i>. This product of feverish writing, which first appeared in
two instalments in<i> Indian Opinion</i>, has remained a key to the
understanding of Gandhi's political philosophy. </p>
      <p>Written in a the form of a dialogue between an Editor and
Reader, and addressing a mixed audience, Gandhi
attempted to convince his readers, that to drive out the English from
India by modern methods of violence was a suicidal policy and that
"modern civilization" was a greater threat than colonialism. When the
text was published in book form in 1910, under the title<i> Indian Home
Rule</i>, by Gandhi's own International Printing Press in South
Africa, it was banned for security reasons. The South African ban
lasted almost thirty years. The first Indian edition was published by
Ganesh and Co. in 1919, with a new foreword and a 'Note' by C.
Rajagopalachari. An American edition came out under the title <i>Sermon
on the Sea</i> in 1924.
      </p>
      <p>Most of Gandhi's writing between<i> Hind Swaraj</i> and <i>Satyagraha
in South Africa</i> (1924-25) took the form of journalism. In 1914 he
returned permanently to India. His most prominent adversary, Gen. Jan
Smuts, wrote to a friend reliefed: "The saint has left our shores, I
hope, forever." Gandhi became a highly influential figure in the
National Congress, transforming it into an instrument of change.
Following the massacre at Amritsar in 1919, in which British soldiers
killed hundreds of Indians, Gandhi launched a policy of non-violent
non-co-operation to secure <i>swaraj</i> (independence) from Britain.
This process made Gandhi a gurulike figure. Resistance methods included
strikes, refusal to pay taxes, abandonment of western for Indian dress,
and refusal to respect colonial law. "One step enough for me," Gandhi
often said without planning his actions far ahead. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Gandhi himself adopted a simple, ascetic way of life, dressing
only in a loincloth of handwoven cloth and sandals. He was jailed
several times and went on hunger strikes to focus attention on his
cause. The bulk of his autobiography, <i>Satayana Prayogo Athava
Atmakatha</i>, he dictated in Gujarati while in Yeravada Jail in
1923-24. It was published serially in <i>Navajivan</i> and <i>Young
India</i> and translated into English by Mahadev Desai, a lawyer and
man of letters, who had joined Gandhi in 1917 and served as his
secretary and diarist. Through the English translation, it has been the
most widely read Gujarati book all over the world. </p>
      <p>When communal riots started on India's northwest frontier in
1924, Gandhi undertook a 21-day purificatory fast. After he had walked
some 200 miles on foot to the sea to collect salt illegally, he was
arrested at Surat and charged for planning to seize the Government salt
depots. As a result of the international attention to the case, the
Viceroy began to relieve the punitive salt taxes and the government
monopoly. </p>
      <p>"We may read the <i>Gita</i> or the <i>Ramayana</i> or <i>Hind
Swaraj</i>", Gandhi said. "But what we have to learn from them is
desire for the welfare of others." Gandhi also strove to raise the
status of untouchables, the caste whom everybody avoided. He gave them
the name <i>harijan</i>, or "children of God", and founded the weekly
paper <i>Harijan</i>, which was published in English and Hindi. In an
attempt to persuade the orthodox Hindus to wipe out the "blight of
untouchability", Gandhi undertook fast in the summer of 1933 for three
weeks. In order to promote village self-sufficiency, Gandhi popularized
handspinning and made know <i>khadi</i>, hand-spun cloth, the "livery
of freedom." However, Gandhi's rejection of the Industrial Revolution
wasn't supported by some his most close fiends, among them Jawaharlal
Nehru. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am not built for academic
writings. Action is my domain." </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1936 Gandhi moved his headquarters from Sabarmati to
Sevagram, a village near Wardha, which became a center to test his
ideas. His eldest son Harilal turned into Islam in 1936 and changed his
name to Abdullah Gandhi. During World War II Gandhi's struggle for
India's independence and <i>satyagraha</i> (defence of and by truth)
became a threat to the war effort of the Allies. Gandhi argued that
India should remain passive and neutral in the world conflict. On May
10, 1942, Gandhi wrote in his newspaper: "The presence of the British
in India is an invitation to Japan to invade India. Their withdrawal
would remove the bait. Assume however that it does not, Free India
would be better able to cope with invasion. Unadulterated
non-co-operation would then have full sway." Gandhi was arrested with
Nehru and other Congress leaders, and interned in Aga Khan&#8217;s Palace at
Poona. At the age of 73, Gandhi began another fast. <a href="churchil.htm">Winston Churchill</a>, Britain's prime minister,
who had earlier called Gandhi a "seditious fakir", suspected that
Gandhi was fed glucose whenever he drank water: "... and this, as well
as his intense vitality and lifelong austerity, enabled this frail
being to maintain his prolonged abstention from any visible form of
food. Nearly all the Indian members of the Viceroy's Executive Council
demanded his release, and resigned in protest at our refusal. In the
end, being quite convinced of our obduracy, he abandoned his fast and
his health, though he was very weak, was not seriously affected."<font><b>
      </b></font><font size="2">(from <i>The Second World War</i>,
vol. 4., by Winston Churchill, 1951).</font><font> </font>Gandhi was
released from custody unconditionally in the spring of 1944. </p>
      <p>Kasturba died at the palace of Aga Khan in 1944. Before her
death, Harilal, the eldest son, had appreared drunk in the palace, and
was chased away. Gandhi saw India gain independence in 1947. However,
he had to witness deploring the formation of two new nations <font face="Symbol">-</font> and savage fighting. His illusion that India
would gain indepencence by nonviolent means was shattered. "Who listens
to me today?" Gandhi said, and did not remain in New Delhi to celebrate
India's freedom on the Fifteenth of August. </p>
      <p>Gandhi's last months were shadowed by communal strife between
Hindu and Muslim. When he walked barefoot through the scorched villages
in East Bengal, locals strewed shattered glass on his path. Gandhi
pleaded for amicable settlement between India and Pakistan, but on
January 30, 1948, he was assassinated in Delhi on his way to an evening
prayer. A young Hindu Brahmin, named Nathuram Godse, viewed Gandhi's
acceptance of partition as a betrayal of the Hindu population, and
fired three shots point-blank. Gandhi had not allowed police to search
people near him. Godse believed that the prayer and the purity of the
mind were signs of superstitions and without the "father of the nation"
India would free to follow the course founded on reason. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Even Gandhi, with all his
charisma, did not melt the hearts of his oppressors, as he had hoped.
After softening, hearts harden again. Asoka too was wrong to think that
he was changing the course of history, and that his righteousness woul
last 'as long as the sun and the moon'." </b>( Theodore Zeldin in </font><i><font size="2">An Intimate History of Humanity</font></i><font size="2">,
1994) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Gandhi has been criticized for his nostalgia for ancient rural
bliss and delaying the modernization and industrialization of his
country. On the other hand, he has been regarded as the "true soul" of
India. With other Hindu sages Gandhi shared a mistrust of worshipping
followers, and he tried to avoid the title <i>mahatma</i>. In spite of
this, his disciplines regarded him as a saint. Gandhi's denial of the
pleasures of food, sex, family, and friendship, has made his way of
life extremely demanding for ordinary people, who otherwise have found
inspiration from his courage and teachings. This question troubled <a href="gorwell.htm">George Orwell</a> in his essay 'Reflections on
Gandhi' (1949). While admitting that Gandhi never made claims of
sainthood, he did not hesitate to reject sainthood as an ideal: "The
essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one
is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one
does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly
intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be
defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of
fastening one's love upon other human individuals." Joseph Lelyveld, a
formed editor of the<i> New York Times</i>, tells in <i>Great Soul:
Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle with India</i> (2011), that Gandi left
his wife for a long time to be with a German-Jewish architecht and
weightlifter named Hermann Kallenbach, and he had a racist attitude
towards Africans. Lelyveld's book was banned in part of India. </p>
