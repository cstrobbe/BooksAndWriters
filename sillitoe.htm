      <p>
English novelist, children's book writer, playwright and social critic,
compared to D.H.Lawrence, who also came from Nottingham. Alan Sillitoe
was grouped among the "angry young men" of the 1950s, with John
Osborne, John Braine, John Wain, Arnold Wesker, and <a href="amis.htm">Kingsley
Amis</a>. He introduced in the post-World War II British fiction
realistically portrayed working-class heroes. Best known for his
novels, Sillitoe also published children's books (starring a cat called
Marmelade Jim), poetry, plays, and an autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">Life without Armour </span>(1995).

      <p>Alan Sillitoe was born in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, the
second son of an illiterate tannery laborer. His father, Christopher
Sillitoe, became one of the long-term unemployed during the 1930s
Depression. On different occasions he worked as a house painter. Once
he was imprisoned for "running up bills for food that he had no hope of
paying." Sillitoe's mother, Silvina (Burton) worked in a lace factory.
"We lived in a room on Talbot Street whose four wall smelled of leaking
gas, stale fat, and layers of mouldering wall-paper," Sillitoe once
recalled. </p>
      <p>Sillitoe's childhood was shadowed by the financial problems of
the family, but he also found early on the joys of literature and began
to plan his career as a writer. However, his first semi-fictional tale
about his wild cousins was burned by his mother for being too
revealing. At the age of 14, he left school and worked in a number of
jobs in Nottingham factories, including a bicycle factory from 1942 to
1946. He served in the Royal Air Force, where he was a wireless
operator. After returning from Malaya, he was discovered to have
tuberculosis. Sillitoe spent sixteen months in an RAF hospital. During
this period he began to write again and read intensively. Pensioned off
at 21 on 45 shillings at week, he lived in France and Spain for seven
years in an attempt to recover.</p>
      <p>In 1951 he met an American poet, Ruth Fainlight, who was
married, but they decided to go abroad together. From 1952 to 1958 they
lived in France, Italy and Spain <font face="Symbol">-</font> largely
on Sillitoe's air force pension. Encouraged by <a href="rgraves.htm">Robert
Graves</a>, whom he met on the island of Mallorca in 1956, Sillitoe
began to write his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Saturday
Night and Sunday Morning</span> (1958), a story about working-class
life in Nottingham. </p>
      <p>Sillitoe used working-class speech in his depiction of the
weekend of a young, robust laborer, Arthur Seaton. Arthur lives for the
weekends, drinking beer in the pub and chasing a girl. Saturday night
is "the best and bingiest glad-time of the week, one of the fifty-two
holidays in the slow-turning Big Wheel of the year, a violent preamble
to a prostate Sabbath." At the outset he declares that "all the rest is
propaganda". As an anti-social hero, Arthur had many similarities with
the characters found in the works of John Braine and Stan Barstow.
Sillitoe's realism was striking to 1950s readers and the novel achieved
also huge critical success. It was adapted for the screen by Karel
Reiz, whose cinematographer Freddie Francis shot in "documentary" style
the long rows of workers' brick houses and grubby homes. However, the
film toned down Sillitoe's use of vernacular and the successful
abortion was changed into an unsuccessful abortion attempt. </p>
      <p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Key to the Door</span>
(1961), a sequel to <i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</i>, the
protagonist was Arthur Seaton's older brother Brian. Arthur returned in
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Birthday</span> (2002), after
40 years. Jenny's 70th birthday brings together Arthur, his wife Avril,
and Brian, who has become famous as a screenwriter. Arthur has remained
in the East Midlands; Avril is dying; Brian and Arthur miss the old
days. </p>
      <p>Among Sillitoe's other acclaimed works from the 1950s is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Loneliness of a Long Distance
Runner&nbsp;</span> (1959), a collection of stories which was awarded
the Hawthornden Prize. The title tale is narrated by a boy in Borstal,
Colin Smith, set to run in a race. He finds a kind of freedom in the
isolated activity of running. The institute's governor has high hopes
that his protegé will be a winner, but the rebellious runner finds an
opportunity to show his defiance of authority. Tony Richardson's film
version of the book drew on the emerging youth culture and the 'Free
Cinema' movement. One script-reader commented on Sillitoe's screenplay
before the filming started: "But this story is blatant and very trying
Communist propaganda, and particularly worrying for us because the hero
is a thief and yet is held up to the admiration of silly young thugs.
If the leading citizens of Nottingham didn't like <i>Saturday Night</i>
because they thought the hero was not a good representative of that
city, I don't know what they will say about this epic." </p>
      <p>The various protagonists of Sillitoe's early fiction are
generally restless young men from the slum world, who oppose the
established order of things, but who are at the same time affected by
consumerism and hedonism. Sillitoe r
ejected artistic elitism and instead of satirizing cosy middle-class
British life, he focused on rebellious individuals and poor people, who
have vile lives. "If I lost all I have in the world I wouldn't worry
much," Sillitoe wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Ragman's Daughter</span> (1963). "If I was to go across the road for a
packet of fags one morning and come back to see the house clapping its
hands in flames with everything I owned burning inside I'd turn my back
without any thought or regret and walk away, even if my jacket and last
ten-bob note were in the flames as well." The collection of short
fiction was praised for its vitality. "Every story (and there is not
one dud) has the exhilaration of revolutionary writing," stated Julian
Jebb in <i>The Sunday Times</i>. <br>
      </p>
      <p> <span style="font-style: italic;">The Death of William
Posters&nbsp;</span> (1965), <span style="font-style: italic;">A Tree
on Fire </span>(1967), and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Start
in Life&nbsp;</span> (1970) formed a trilogy about a Nottingham factory
worker. In the 1970s he produced another trilogy, consisting of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Flower of Life</span> (1974), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Widower's Son </span>(1976) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Storyteller </span>(1979). A selection of
his short stories, mostly written beween 1959-1981, Sillitoe collected
in <span style="font-style: italic;">New and Collected Short Stories</span>
(2003). </p>
      <p>Sillitoe moved in his later works beyond this lower-class
milieu towards analysis of the psychological states of his characters.
In the autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">Raw
Material </span>(1972) he portrayed his grandparents,<i> A
Start in Life</i> leaves the protagonist peacefully cultivating his
garden, bemused by a prophecy that he will go wild again at
thirty-five. </p>
      <p>In 1959 Sillitoe married Ruth Fainlight; they had a son and
adopted a daughter. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rats and
Other Poems</span> (1960) was Sillitoe's first published book of verse.
"I have always regarded myself as a poet before novelist," Sillotoe
once said, but he met with little critical success for his poetry. In
1963 Sillitoe spent a month in the Soviet Union, recording his
impressions in <span style="font-style: italic;">Road to
Volgograd&nbsp;</span> (1964). Three years later he drove in his car
(it was dark blue Peugeot Estate) from Harwich to Leningrad. Sillitoe
made several trips to the Soviet Union, where he was viewed as a
spokesman for the oppressed working classes. However, Sillitoe's stand
against the oppression of free speech annoyed the authorities. Mostly
he lived with his family in London, but also spent time in France,
Tangier, Spain, and Israel. Alan Sillitoe died in London on April 25,
2010. He was 82. </p>
