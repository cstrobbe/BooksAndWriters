<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American writer of experimental
novels, who lived long times in Mexico City, Tanger, Paris, and London.
Burroughs's homosexual themes in <em>The Naked Lunch</em> (1959) and
the frankness with which he dealt with his own experiences as a drug
addict sparkled the last major obscenity trial in U.S., but won him a
following among writers, musicians, and film makers. Burroughs produced
the bulk of his writing after he moved to London and took an
apomorphine cure under the direction of Dr John Dent. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You know how old people lose all shame
about eating, and it makes you puke to watch them? Old junkies are the
same about junk. They gibber and squeal about the sight of it. The spit
hangs off their skin, and their stomach rumbles and all their guts
grind in peristalsis while they cook up, dissolving the body's decent
skin, you expect any moment a great blob of protoplasm will flop right
out and surround the junk. Really disgust you to see it."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Naked Lunch</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>


<p>William Seward Burroughs II was born in St. Louis, Mo. into a
successful business family. His mother, Laura Lee, was a direct
descendant of Robert E. Lee, his grandfather the inventor of the
Burroughs adding machine. The Burroughs Corporation ultimately merged
with the Sperry Corporation to create Unisys. By the time of
Burroughs's birth, his father Mortimer had already sold his stock in
the company. </p>
<p>After six years at the private Community School, Burroughs sent to
the John Burroughs School. He also spent some time at the Los Alamos
Ranch School for boys. "As a boy," he later recalled, "I was much
plagued by nightmares. I remember a nurse telling me that opium gives
you sweet dreams, and I resolved that I would smoke opium when I grew
up." At the age of 14, he read Jack Black's <i>You Can't Win</i>. This 
autobiographical account of hobo life had a profound effect on his world view and later influenced <i>The Naked Lunch</i>.
Burroughs graduated in English literature from Harvard University in
1936. During this period he lost his heterosexual virginity in an East
St. Louis brothel. However, he had also recorded his homosexual
fantasies in a diary at Los Alamos. </p>
<p>Burroughs traveled in Europe, where he studied medicine in Venice
for a year. While in Austria he married a Jewish woman who wanted to
escape the Nazis. After returning to the United States Burroughs
studied anthropology at Harvad. In the early 1940s he lived in New York
City and worked for an advertising agency. When the war began,
Burroughs joined the army. He was trained as a glider pilot, but was
discharged as unfit for service in 1942. The major reason was his
relationship with a hustler named Jack Anderson. Burroughs had
amputated one of his little fingers after Anderson left him. Rejecting
his background, Burroughs plunged into an alternative life-style that
included drugs, odd jobs, and bisexuality. While working in the
shipyards of New York, he became addicted to heroin, or what he called
Opium Jones, G(od's) O(wn) (Medicine). Drug addiction was not new in
the family. Burroughs's uncle Horace used morphine. He committed
suicide in 1915. </p>

<p>In the mid-1940s Burroughs befriended with <a href="ginsberg.htm">Allen 
Ginsberg</a> and <a href="kerouac.htm">Jack Kerouac</a>, with whom he would 


be linked as key figures in the Beat Movement. He was named in Kerouac' s 
novel <i>On the Road</i>
as Old Bull Lee. "He was an exterminator in Chicago, a bartender in New
York, a summons-server in Newark. In Paris he sat at café tables,
watching the sullen French faces go by. In Athens he looked up from his
<i>ouzo</i> at what he called the ugliest people in the world. In
Istanbul he threaded his way through crowds of opium addicts and
rug-sellers, looking for the facts. In English hotels he read Spengler
and the Marquis de Sade." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">On the Road</font></i><font size="2">)</font> </p>
<p>With Joan Vollmer, his common law wife, Burroughs moved to Texas,
where he grew cotton and marijuana crops. To avoid legal problems, they
moved to Mexico City. Joan could no longer get Benzedrine, instead she
drank cheap tequila. To her friends she said that her days were
numbered. In September 1951 Burroughs killed Vollmer accidentally. They
were partying in a room above a bar when he announced the assembled
company he would perform shooting in the Wilhelm Tell style. Vollmer
placed a water glass on top of her head, and Burroughs shot at it from
about six feet away with the gun he carried&nbsp;&#8211; missing tragically
and Vollmer fell dead. Burroughs was never tried for the accident.
Their son William Burroughs III died at the age of 32 from drink and
drug abuse. The author have stated that "Im forced to the appalling
conclusion that I would never have become a writer but for Joan's
death..." It has been said, that Ginsberg's opus <em>Howl!</em> was written after a dream&nbsp;of Joan. </p>

<p>Burroughs lived for a time in Tangier in a male brothel. Ginsberg
and Kerouac visited Tangiers in 1957. In 1959 Burroughs published <i>The Naked Lunch</i>,
which is now accepted as a modern classic. Much of its structure was
planned by Allen Ginsberg, who gathered the scraps of paper that he
found scattered around in Burroughs's room. The book consists of
twenty-one satirical pieces that purport to lay bare the horrors of
reality: hence the title. "Let them see what they eat." It featured
such characters as Dr Benway, a mad scientist dedicated to Automatic
Obedience Processing, and the Lobotomy Kid, who manufactures the
Complete All-American male, a blob of jelly. First the work published
by Olympia Press in Paris, In England it appeared in 1964, as part of <em>Dead Fingers Talk</em>, an amalgam which also included <em>The Soft Machine</em>&nbsp;and <em>The Ticket That Exploded</em>.
The nightmarish visions of William Lee, a junk addict contains science
fiction, biological fantasy, disgusting images, and sick jokes. "May
all your troubles be little one, as one child molester says to the
other."<font size="2"> (from <i>Naked Lunch</i>) </font>It also tries
to find from the use of drugs and homosexuality a philosophical
statement&nbsp;&#8211; addiction is seen as a metaphor of the human condition<b>.</b></p>
<p>The plotless novel was a tough challenge for the Canadian film
director David Cronenberg, whose science fiction films often deal with
biological mutations. "Given an impossibly difficult text to film,
Cronenberg made an excellent decision to avoid the kind of ponderous,
literal (mis)reading of a classic American novel that marks, for
instance, Joseph Strick's <i>Ulysses</i>. Instead, he used the entire
Burroughs opus and the legendary biography as the interpretation for
his film that became a brilliant <i>response </i>to the novel, rather than an adaptation per se."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Novels into Films</font></i><font size="2"> by John C. Tibbetts and James M. Welsh, 1999) </font>Cronenberg
added in the film scenes from Burroughs's life, accidentally shooting
of his wife, literary friends who have much similarities with Ginsberg
and Kerouac, and an American expatriate couple, referring to Paul and
Jane Bowles. </p>
<p>In Paris Burroughs's address at 9, rue Git-le-Coeur was known as
"the Beat Hotel," but his focus had began to shift to another kind of
literarure.&nbsp;He became friends with the painter Brion Gysin, who
influenced his fiction, especially his 'cut-up' technique. Burroughs's
ideas on writing has never been orthodox. "My basic theory is that the
written word was actually a virus," he once said, "that made the spoken
word possible. The word has not been recognized as a virus because it
has achieved a state of stable symbiosis with the host..." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Job</font></i><font size="2">, 1974)</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Burroughs
moved in the mid-1960s to London, where he studied Scientology and
started to use the E-Meter, a piece of equipment that operated like a
lie detector and was developed by the Scientologists.&nbsp;<em>Ali's&nbsp;Smile&nbsp;/ Naked Scientology</em>&nbsp;(1972)
collected Burroughs's opinions on the movement. Following an
apomorphine treatment devised by Dr. John Yerby Dent, Burroughs
temporarily freed himself from his heroin addiction. Most of the 1960s,
Burroughs's boyfriend was Ian Sommerville, a mathematician, who
operated Paul McCartney's studio
at 34 Montagu Square. Burroughs used the studio for his experimental
'Hello, Yes, Hello' tapes. "He was very interesting but we never really
struck up a huge conversation," recalled
McCartney. "I actually felt you had to be a bit of a junkie, which
was probably not true." </p>
<p>In the 1970s Burroughs returned to New York, where he got hooked on
heroin again. Eventually he settled in the small university town,
Lawrence, Kansas. In 1983 Burroughs became a writer in residence to the
university and devoted to his spare time to a vegetable garden. His
last years Burroughs lived with cats (Calico Jane, Ruski, Fletch,
Horatio, Smoky, Ed, Ginger, Wimpy, et al.) and handguns and rifles. He
also exhibited 'action paintings' produced by taking potshots at tins
of paint. Burroughs<b> </b>died of heart failure on August 2, 1997, in Lawrence. </p>



<p>In his works Burroughs developed with painter Brion Gysin a 'cut-up'
method, that employed cutting and blending several random texts into
one hybrid narrative. Thus Burroughs has attempted to avoid
conventional language patterns and to restructure readers
consciousness. He began writing in the 1930s, but his first book, <em>Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict</em>, came out in 1953 
under the pen name William Lee&nbsp;&#8211; he did not want to upset his parents. Part of the sequel, <em>Queer</em> (1985), Burrough wrote already in 1952. The book was not published until decades later due to its homosexual content. </p>
<p><i>The Naked Lunch</i> was completed after 
Burroughs's treatment for drug addiction. Other works include <i>The Soft 
Machine </i>(1961), <em>Nova Express</em>&nbsp;(1964), and <em>The Wild Boys</em>&nbsp;(1971). Christopher Isherwood proclaimed Burroughs's <em>Cities of the Red Night</em>&nbsp;(1981)
as a masterpiece. Although it mixed a virus plague and CIA with a
missing boy, intergalactic conspiracy, and an eighteen-century pirate
captain, it is considered one of Burroughs's most coherent novels.
However, while writing the book, he underwent several operations in an
effort to close an abdominal cyst and spent much of his time and money
on drugs. In the sequels of <i>The Red Night</i> trilogy, <em>The Place of Dead Roads</em> (1983), a western where cowboys are gay, and <em>The Western Lands</em>&nbsp;(1987), Burroughs also depicted a deadly virus plaguing humankind, "inexorably headed for extinction". <em>The Yage Letters</em>, 
published in 1963, was based on Burroughs's travels through the Amazon region of South America in search for the drug <i>yage</i>, the notorious "final fix". <i>The Wild Boys </i>was
set in the year 1988. Adolescent guerrilla packs of specialized
humanoids are routing the forces of civilized nations and ravaging the
earth. When wholesale slaughter erupts, the battle continues
underground where the survivors evolve into The Wild Boys, hordes of
pitiless homosexual warriors who move in and destroy the cities. </p>
<p>Burroughs has warned of the "Control Machine", forces of conformity
that would destroy the unique qualities of the individual. In <i>Nova Express</i> and <i>The Ticket That Exploded</i>
they are agents from other space and a virus from Venus. Material for
his novels the author has borrowed from all areas of popular culture.
In science fiction his influence can be seen in the works of J.G.
Ballard, Michael Moorcock, John T. Sladek, Norman Spinard, and others.
Overt pastiches of his works include Barrington J. Bayley's <i>The Four-Color Problem</i> (1971) and Philip José Farmer's <i>The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod</i> (1968).Apart from the bands (Soft Machine, Dead Fingers Talk), which took their names directly from his works, David Bowie, <a href="http://www.blondiebook.com/">Debbie Harry</a>, REM, Nirvana, and others have paid homage to Burroughs. The writer is also found from the cover of the famous Beatles album <i>Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> (1967). </p>
<p>Burroughs even appeared in an advert for Nike and in a strange
Japanese 'document', which depicted the search of Albert Einstein's
brains - finally found in a class jar, owned by a downhill scientist. <i>In Drugstore Cowboy</i> Burroughs 
acted Matt Dillon's elder brother. His other films include <i>Twister</i> and U2 music video <i>Last Night on Earth</i>. Burroughs recorded with Laurie Anderson, Kurt Cobain, and Michael Stipe. 
He has been awarded the honour of inventing the music term "heavy 
metal."
