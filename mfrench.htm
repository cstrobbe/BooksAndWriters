<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American author and feminist scholar, who
argued in her study <i>The War Against Women</i> (1992), that women's
suppression is an intrinsic part of the male-dominated global culture.
Marilyn French first gained fame with her debut novel<i> The Women's
Room</i> (1977), which became an international bestseller. French's
readers have said that her books have left them "with things to think
about far into the future," and helped them to understand "why the
feminist movement came to be" and "refuse to mindlessly accept any
long-standing institution for the sake of tradition." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Today, women are educated in most
industrial countries, and can work in a variety (but not all) areas.
But male superiors, reluctant to advance them, rarely place them on a
track to higher office. In nonindustrial or developing countries, women
hold about 6 percent of government posts; in most European nations,
they hold 5 to 11 percent.'' </b></font><b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from <i>The War Against Women</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Marilyn French was born in New York into a poor family of
Polish descent. Her father, E. Charles Edwards, was an engineer, and
mother, Isabel Hazz Edwards, a department-store clerk. As a child,
French was a voracious reader. She also wrote from a very early age.
Though she was interested in philosophy, she studied literature at
Hofstra College (now University) in Long Island, taking her a B.A.
in 1951. The previous year she had married Robert M. French Jr., a
lawyer, whom she supported through law school.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>French began to write seriously in 1957, but had only few
stories and articles published in nearly twenty years. In 1964 she
earned her M.A. and between the years 1964 and 1968 she was an
instructor at Hofstra University. After raising two children and
divorce, she continued her studies at Harvad University, taught English
at Hofstra and received her Ph.D. in 1972. From 1972 to 1976 she was a
teacher at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. </p>
      <p> French's first book was her thesis on <a href="/jjoyce.htm">James
Joyce</a> (1976). A year later it was followed by <i>The Women's Room.
      </i>The biting social commentary became a cultural phenomenon,
was translated into some twenty languages, and made into a television
movie in 1980. Its central character is Mira Ward, whose life is traced
from her childhood to middle age. Mira builds her life after divorce
and finds that there is no balance between the sexes. "The school had
been planned for men, and there were places, she had been told, where
women weree simply not permitted to go. It was odd. Why? she wondered.
Women were so unimportant anyway, why would anyone bother to keep them
out?" Additional views offer other voices, whom Mira encounters on her
voyage of self-discovery. The success of <i>The Women's Room</i>
enabled French to write and publish without doubt and anxiety about
money.</p>
      <p>The battle between sexes was again the main subject in
French's second novel, <i>The Bleeding Heart</i> (1980). This time the
story focused on a middle-aged woman, who has a love affair with a
married American man on her sabbatical leave in England. The
relationship of a submissive woman and a dominant man is doomed. In her
non-fiction scholarly book <i>Shakespeare's Division of Experience </i>(1981)
French examined the polarity between the masculine and feminine
principles. She argued that <a href="/shakespe.htm">Shakespeare</a>
"never abandoned belief in male legitimacy or horror of female
sexuality." </p>
      <p><i>Her Mother's Daughter</i> (1987) was a story about four
generations of women, and the bond between mothers and daughters. The
narrator, Anastasia, is determined to avoid the oppression of her
forbears and the self-denial of her mother, Bella, but she is haunted
by that collective past. "I don't know any successful woman with love
in her life. Men can manage it, but not women. Disproportion in
numbers, and besides, men are too threatened by independent women. They
can always find one who will built up their ego. And I, we, independent
women, can't find a man who doesn't need continual bolstering." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Her Mother's Daughter</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font> The characters of Bella and Frances were
based on French's own mother and grandmother. <i>Beyond Power: On
Women, Men and Morals</i> (1986) was a series of essays on the history
of the treatment of women by men in the past 2500 years. The book was
criticized for romanticizing matriarchal cultures. </p>
      <p> <i>The War Against Women</i> (1992) was a study of
oppression and violence of different institutions and individuals in
patriarchal world. According to French, the violence has become more
threatening as an answer to Feminist movement. "Men's need to dominate
women may be based in their own sense of marginality or emptiness; we
do not know its root, and men are making no effort to discover it. But
men's long-standing war against women is now, in reaction to women's
movements across the world, taking on a new ferocity, new urgency, and
new veneers.''<font size="2"><b> </b></font><b><font size="2"> </font></b>French
argued that physical, economic, and political attack on women is an
intrinsic part of today's male-dominated global society. All men are
rapist and that's all they are, was her conclusion. When French
promoted the book in Ireland, she met President Mary Robinson. The
meeting horrified conservative groups. </p>
      <p>In <i>Our Father </i>(1995) the presidential advisor Stephen
Upton has suffered a stroke, and his daughters gather in his mansion to
await his death or recovery. Gradually they learn one another's
secrets; all the four daughters have been raped by their father when
they were girls. <i>My Summer with George</i> (1996) was a story of a
summer love affair. The protagonist is Hermione Beldame, a women's
romance writer who meets George Johnson, a s
outhern newspaper editor, and starts to fantasize about her future with
George. <i>A Season in Hell</i> (1998) was French's personal account
of her journey through cancer treatment <font face="Symbol">-</font>
she had been smoking since she was fifteen. At the age of 61 she was
told she had metastasized esophageal cancer, and she was offered no
hope. Determined to "remain a human being, a thinker and a writer who
was temporarily ill", French won her battle and a series of other
medical crises and negative treatment from doctors. On one level, her
illness became part of her struggle against male insensitivity: "One
would think that anyone over thirty must know pain, but in fact, men in
our society are encouraged to deny pain and suffering, and medical
schools tend to encourage such denial. As a result, many doctors, women
as well as men, become brittle and closed off. Of course, they suffer <font face="Symbol">-</font> that is inevitable <font face="Symbol">-</font>
but they don't let themselves feel their suffering, so derive no
knowledge from it and cannot use it. And what we deny ourselves, we
deny others." </p>
      <p><i>From Eve to Dawn </i>(2002) was more than 1,700 pages long
global history of women, in which the emphasis was on how men have
oppressed women. Can a species survive, French once asked, when half
its members systematically assault the other? When <i>The New York
Times</i> (September 3, 2006) said on French's sixth novel, <i>In the
Name of Friendship</i> (2006), that "this book feels like a journey
back in time", the author answered, "it appears that the new
position of the editors of the Book Review is that feminism is an
illegitimate subject for literature." French died of heart failure in
2009, at the age of 79, in Manhattan. At the time of her death she was
working on a memoir. </p>
