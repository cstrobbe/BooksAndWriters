<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist, essayist, and
short story
writer, who gained international fame with her metaphysical historical
novels. In these works Yourcenar drew psychologically penetrating
portraits of people from the distant past, but she also dealt with
modern issues such as homosexuality and deviance. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"- Voyez, continua Zénon. Par-delà ce
village, d'autres villages, par delà cette abbaye, d'autres abbayes,
par-delà cette fortresse, d'autres fortresses. Et dans chacun des
châteaux d'idées, des masures d'opinions superposés aux masures de bois
et aux châteaux de pierre, la vie emmure les fous et ouvre un pertuis
aux sages."</b> (in</font><i><font size="2"> L'&#338;uvre au Noir</font></i><font size="2">, 1968) </font></blockquote>

<p>Marguerite Yourcenar was born Marguerite Antoinette Jeanne Marie Ghislane in Brussels, 
Belgia, into a Franco-Belgian family. Yourcenar's Bergian mother, Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne, 
died of puerperal fever and peritonitis shortly after giving birth. Yourcenar spent her summer 
months from 1903 to 1912 at the château of Mont-Noir, "a small brick manor house, built with 
a great many superadded turrets, in that Louis XIII style so cherished during the Romantic era. The date 
1824 was engraved on the façade..." She began to write as a teenager, when she lived traveling 
and aristocratic life with her father, Mechel de Crayencour. 
Her pen-name she later created from the surname of her father; Yourcenar is 
a nearly perfect anagram. Her first books he had published at his own expense. Much of his time he spent gambling, 
hoping to win back the fortune he had lost.</p>
<p>The inheritance Yourcenar received after the death of his father, allowed her to devote herself 
to traveling and literary pursuits and love affairs on the Paris lesbian scene. 
In the story 'How Wang-Fo Was Saved' from <i>Oriental Tales</i>
(1938), a collection of short stories from several countries, Yourcenar
studied the artist's role in the world. Algernon Blackwood also had
used the same Chinese legend in 'The Man Who Was Milligan' and M.R.
James in 'The Mezzotint'. In a version told in the classic Sanskrit
epic, the <i>Ramayana</i>, a famous poet is thrown into prison by an angry king. To escape he calls his creations to help him <font face="Symbol">-</font>
they break into the poet's cell and set him free. The protagonist in
Yourcenar's tale is an old painter, who loves the image of things and
not the things themselves. The painter is imprisoned by an Emperor, who
sees his autocracy threatened by the power and beauty of art. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The kingdom of Han is not the most
beautiful of kingdoms, and I am not the Emperor. The only empire which
is worth reigning over is which you alone can enter, old Wang, by the
road of One Thousand Curves and Ten Thousand Colors. You alone reign
peacefully over mountains covered in snow that cannot melt, and over
fields of daffodils that cannot die. And that is why, Wang-Fo, I have
imagined a punishment for you, for you whose enchantment has given me
the disgust of everything I own, and the desire for everything I shall
never possess."</b> (in 'How Wang-Fo Was Saved') </font></blockquote>
<p>At the outbreak of World War II, Yourcenar moved to the United
States. To support herself, she worked as professor of French
literature at Sarah-Lawrence-College in New York. One of her students
has recalled, that she was not a professor like the others, her "way of
teaching was not that of a classical teacher but someone who is crazy
about literature." <span class="st">Though
quiet and retiring by nature, she had&nbsp;love affairs with both men
and women. When she left her private papers to the Houghton Manuscript
Library&nbsp;she stipulated that her private journal not be made
available for the public until fifty years after her death. </span></p><p>Yourcenar
shared her time between France and the USA, where&nbsp; she lived with
her partner, Grace Frick, who&nbsp;came from Kansas City.
Orphaned&nbsp;early on, she had been raised by her uncle. Grace earned
her Master's in English literature in 1927;&nbsp;Frick was the
translator of several of her works. After 1950 Yourcenar's home was on
Mount Desert Island, Maine. In 1980 she became the first woman to be
elected to the Academie Française. Frick died from cancer in 1979.
Yourcenar then entered into a stormy relationship with Jerry Wilson
(1949&#8211;1986), a gay photographer, with whom he travelled around the
world. He died of AIDS. In an interview, published in <i>The Paris Review</i>, Yourcenar said that 
"certainly all the physical evidence points to our total annihilation, 
but if one also considers all the metaphysical <i>données</i>, one is tempted to say that it 
is not as simple as that." Yourcenar continued traveling but also kept on writing&nbsp;<em>Quoi ? L'éternité</em>&nbsp;
(1988), the final volume of her autobiographical trilogy. Its title was
taken from Rimbaud: "Elle est retrouvée! / Quoi? l'éternite. / C'est
la mer mêlée / Au soleil..." Disappointing many readers, Yourcenar
focused on her father &#8211; guarding her privacy as she had done throughout
her literary career, she had no intentions to tell about her own life
after WW II in the United States.
Yourcenar died in Northeast Harbor, Maine on December 17, 1987. </p>


<p>Among Yourcenar's best-known books is <i>Memoirs of Hadrian</i>. The
emperor is portrayed on the eve of his death, absorbed in his
reflections. Hadrian, who built the famous wall, was one of the last
great Roman imperial leaders. He recounts his memories in his testament
letter to his chosen successor, Marcus Aurelius. "There is but one
thing in which I feel superior to most men: I am freer, and at the same
time more compliant, than they dare to be. Nearly all of them fail to
recognise their due liberty, and likewise their true servitude. They
curse their fetters, but seem to find them matter for pride. Yet they
pass their days in vain license, and do not know how to fashion for
themselves the lightest yoke. For my part I have sought liberty more
than power, and power only because it can lead to freedom." Part of the
story deals with his relationship with a Greek youth called Antinous.
Yourcenar worked on the novel for fifteen years and published it
immediately after settling in the United States.</p>
<p><i>Coup de Grâce (1957) </i>was a story of a Prussian officer, who murders the woman who loves him because he loves her brother. <i>The Abyss </i>
(1976) was a fictitious life of Zeno, a Renaissance man, created from
Yourcenar's fascination with the occult. She worked on the story
intermittently from 1921 to 1965. Zeno's personality and life is a
combination of Da Vinci, Paracelsus, Copernicus, and Giordano Bruno. He
travels around Europe and the Mediterranean searching for truth. In the
rivalry between Catholic and Protestant states, Zeno refuses to take
sides, and like Hadrian, Yourcenar depicts him as essentially
homosexual.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"The
strange magma which preachers define by the not ill-chose name of lust
(since it would seem to be a matter of the luxuriance of the flesh
expending its force) defies examination because of the variety of
substance which compose it, and which in their turn break down into
other components, themselves complex. Love is one part of the mixture,
though less often, perhaps than is admitted, but the concept of love is
itself far from simple." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>The central figures in Yourcenar's fiction are torn between
society's demands and their own passions. Noteworthy, the majority of
the characters she presents are male. Yourcenar's only novel with a
contemporary setting was <em>Le Denier du rêve</em> (1934), about an
assassination attempt on Mussolini. The book was written while she
lived in Italy, and revised in 1958-59. Through her characters <font face="Symbol">-</font> a doctor, a flower-seller, a whore, and a Resistance fighter <font face="Symbol">-</font>
Yourcenar examines life under a cruel regime and offerers different
views into the female psyche. A woman loves unhappiness, another is
"stingy like all who have just enough money for a single expense and
enough fore for a single passion." </p>
<p>In <em>Alexis</em>, which&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1929 and again in
1965 with Yourcenar's foreword, a young aristocratic man writers a long
letter to his wife, Monique. Alexis confesses that he did not love his
wife, and at school he already found women disgusting. He has decided
to leave her and his son, and devote himself to his music and sensual
pleasures, that are not against his own true self. The author is
purposefully ambiguous about their nature and Alexis's sexual
orientation. In her foreword Yourcenar denies that <a href="agide.htm">Gide</a>'s <i>Traité du Vain Désir </i>had influenced her book. Yourcenar's <i>Mishima: A Vision of the Void </i>(1980) tried to separate the<i> persona</i>
or shadow of great Japanese writer, and homosexual, and the human being
of flesh and blood. "... let us remember that the central reality must
be sought in the writer's work: it is what the writer chose to write,
or was compelled to write, that finally matters. And certainly
Mishima's carefully premeditated death is part of his work." </p>
<p>The first version of<em> Anna, soror...</em> (1981) Yourcenar
composed already at the age of 22. The central characters are Miguel, a
young aristocrat, and his sister Anna. They live and love earch other
in seclusion from the surrounding world after the death of their
mother. Yourcenar's family memoirs,&nbsp; <em>Souvenirs pieux</em> (1974) and <em>Archives du Nord</em>&nbsp;
(1977), prove the author's skill to depict contemporary life.
Yourcenar's other works include prose poems FEUX (1935), and <em>Fleuve profound, sombre rivière</em>(1974),
essays ('Without Liability to Debts,' 1962; 'Mishima or the Vision of
Emptiness,' 1981), and several plays. Yourcenar also translated Negro
spirituals and various English and American novels into her native
French. </p>
