<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->German philologist, educator, critic, and
literary historian, originally trained as a lawyer. Auerbach's famous
account of the genesis of the novel, <i>Mimesis</i> (1946), has been
since its appearance one the most widely read scholarly works on
literary history and criticism. René Wellek, Auerbach's colleague at
Yale University, wrote: "The work is a strikingly successful
combination of philology, stylistics, history of ideas and sociology,
of meticulous learning and artistic taste, of historical imagination
and awareness of our own age."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">A History of Modern Criticism 1970-1950</font></i><font size="2">, Volume 7, 1991)</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He who represents the course of a human
life, or a sequence of events extending over a prolonged period of
time, and represents it from beginning to end, must prune and isolate
arbitrary. Life has always long since begun, and it is always still
going on. And the people whose story the author is telling experience
much more than he can ever hope to tell. But the things that happen to
a few individuals in the course of a few minutes, hours, possibly even
days - these one can hope to report with reasonable completeness." </b>(Auerbach in </font><i><font size="2">Mimesis</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Erich Auerbach was born in Berlin into a upper-middle class Jewish
family. The son of a prosperous merchant, he grew up in privileged
circumstances in a predominantly Jewish
neighborhood in Charlottenburg. At the French gymnasium, an
elite school, he underwent a training in classical studies and in
reading and writing French. In 1913 Auerbach received a Doctor of Law
degree from the
University of Heidelberg, where got to know several members of the Max
Weber circle. During World War I he served in the German army, and was
wounded in the leg; the injury left him with a limp. <br>
</p>
      <p>Even before the war Auerbach renounced law for
literature. He changed disciplines and earned his doctorate in Romance
philology from the University of Greifswald in 1921, where his advicer
Erhard Lommatzsch had moved. His dissertation was entitled <i>Zur Technik der Frührenaissancenovelle in Italien und Frankreich</i>.
In 1922 he married Marie Mankiewitz, whose family was the largest private shareholder of the Deutsche Bank<em>.</em>
They had one son, Clemens. Marie's younger sister married&nbsp; Raoul
Hausmann, a founding member of the Dada movement in Berlin.<br>
</p>

      <p>Between the
years 1923 and 1929 Auerbach served as a librarian of the Prussian
State Library in Berlin, spending these years just reading, translating Giambattista Vico's <i>Scienza nuova</i>, and writing his first book of Dante. After a paper on Vico in 1922, Auerbach's 
German translation <i>Scienza nuova</i>
appeared in 1924 and then in 1927 his translation of Croce's
introduction to Vico. At the age of thirty-seven, he was appointed the chair of Romance philology at the University of
Marburg, succeeding Leo Spitzer, who had moved to Cologne. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Auerbach spent only six years as a professor in Germany. To
keep his job, he took the oath of allegiance to Hitler in 1934. In
Marburg he gained recognition with his work <i>Dante, Poet of the Secular World</i>
(1929). Auerbach argued that after Dante myth and legend became
history; he was the first great realist author, "the concrete
individual in his unity and wholeness; in that he has been followed by
all subsequent portrayers of man." Later Harold Bloom elaborated these
lines of thought when he wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human</span> (1998) that Shakespeare "invented the
human as we continue to know it." The other major authors and thinkers,
to whom Auerbach showed a lifelong interest, were Vico and
Benedetto Croce. <br>
      </p>

      <p>Following Hitler's election as chancellor of
German in 1933, a law was passed which would make impossible for Jews
to hold official positions. Aurbach was dismissed by the Nazis in 1935.
With a letter from Croce, and with support of Spitzer, he went to
Istanbul where he taught at the Istanbul State
University. Like many other German émigrés, he settled in the suburb of
Bebek. <br>
 </p>


<p>During his years in Turkey Auerbach wrote his famous work, <i>Mimesis</i>, 
which was first published in German in 1946 and seven years later in English. In Istanbul Auerbach 
did not have access to all the literature he needed and the libraries were not well equipped for 
European studies. "On the other hand it is quite possible that the book owes its 
existence to just this lack of a rich and specialized library. It had been possible for 
me to acquaint myself with all the work that has been done on so many subjects, I might 
never have reached the point of writing." Two smaller studies dating from this period 
appeared in Finland in the journal <i>Neuphilologische Mitteilungen.</i> </p>

<p>In 1947 
Auerbach moved to the United States. 
Having been cast out of Europe and deciding not to return, 
Auerbach refused the offer of a chair in West Germany.
For a short period, he was a teacher at Pennsylvania State University.  
Due to a preexisting heart problem, he had to leave because he could not be insured 
by the university's insurance company. 

Before Auerbach was appointed Professor of French and Romance philology 
at Yale University,  a temporary refuge, with the help of <a href="panof.htm">Erwin Panofsky</a>, was found at 
the Institute for Advanced Study 
in Princeton in 1949-50.  In 1956 he was  
named Sterling Professor of Romance Philology. 
 
Auerbach died in Wallingford, Connecticut, on October 13, 1957. </p>
<p>In <i>Mimesis</i> Auerbach examined changing conceptions of reality
as they are reflected in literary works.
His point of view constantly moves between the content and analysis of
the language and such
questions as the difference between the high and low style. The word
"mimesis" has almost the same meaning as "mime," but is broadly
translated as "imitation." Auerbach starts from Homer and continues
throught the texts of Dante, Shakespeare, Cervantes, etc. ending with
such writers as Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf. Often he first
focuses on stylistic analysis and interpretations of meaning, and from
these comments he moves to broader observations on social history and
culture. Although Auerbach analyzes writers' attitudes toward reality,
he does not rush to give the reader his own definition of the concept
"realism." Auerbach's idea is to approach the subject from different
points of view, through writers and a selection of excerpts from wide
variety of texts, mostly from France and Italy. From Scandinavian
writers Ibsen is settled with a few sentences and about Russian realism
Auerbach writes: "...remembering it came into its own only during the
nineteenth century and indeed only during the second half of it, we
cannot escape the observation that it is based on a Christian and
traditionally patriarchal concept of the creatural dignity of every
human being regardless of social rank and position, and hence that it
is fundamentally related to old-Christian than to modern occidental
realism. The enlightened, active bourgeoisie, with its assumption of
economic and intellectual leadership, which everywhere else underlay
modern culture in general and modern realism in particular, seems to
have scarcely existed in Russia." </p>
<p>According to Auerbach, <a href="stendhal.htm">Stendhal</a> and <a href="balzac.htm">Balzac</a> broke the 
rigid separation of stylistic levels, dating from classical antiquity, in which the low, comic mode was reserved 
for the description of ordinary, everyday reality, and tragic, the problematic, the serious within everyday life 
was depicted in the high style. But before these French writers, who did not separate the serious and the 
realistic, the unification of styles was seen in Dante's <i>Commedia</i>. Christ's passion, in which the low 
and the sublime were combined, broke down the hierarchical rules of literary depiction for the first time. 
Modern realistic view of the world was fully developed in the character of Julien Sorel from Stendhal's 
novel <i>The Red and the Black</i> (1830) &#8211; Sorel's tragic life is deeply connected with the historical, social, and political conditions of the period. </p>
<p>René Wellek has criticized that Auerbach's concept of realism is contradictory: "... the early 
examples of the uses of realism are quite different from those he uses in the later sections on Stendhal, 
Balzac, and the Goncourts. He uses the term realism in the book in the most diverse manner, yet still 
always referring to the "represented reality." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">A History 
of Modern Criticism 1970-1950</font></i><font size="2">, Volume 7)</font> Also the concept of mimesis has been 
defined in many ways in contemporary aesthetics, referring sometimes to the inner world of consciousness. 
Against the view of the novel as a realistic representation of human experience, structuralists and 
deconstructionists have emphasized the self-referentiality of all literature. Auerbach himself insisted, 
that the New Criticism was a  threat to scholarship. </p>
