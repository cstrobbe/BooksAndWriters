      <p>Prolific playwright, pioneer of Spanish drama, author of as
many as
1800 <i>comedias </i>and several hundred shorter dramatic pieces, of
which about 500 have been printed.&nbsp;Lope de Vega's achievement is
considered among Spanish writers second only to that of <a href="cervante.htm">Cervantes</a>. His life was as dramatic as his
plays: he was a volunteer on the Invincible Armada; his many love
affairs brought him both notoriety and problems with the law, resulting
in prison terms and exile. </p>

      <p>Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio was born in Madrid. His parents
were not wealthy and came from the mountain region of Santander, in
northern Spain. Already as a child Lope showed literary talent,
composing his first verses&nbsp; before he could use a pen. At the age
of ten he started to translate poems from Latin. At twelve Lope wrote
his first play. </p>
      <p>Lope studied under the Jesuits in Madrid, and after studying
at the University of Alcalá, he joined the army in 1583. He then
returned to Madrid, becoming the leader of the literary circles. Around
this time he formed a liaison with Elena Osorio, the married daughter
of an actor and leading theatre manager, Jerónimo Velásquez. She was
the inspiration of Lope's early writings, the 'Filis', for whom&nbsp;he
wrote a number of verses. When Elena started to favour a younger
suitor,&nbsp;she became the&nbsp;object of his hatred. Lope was
eventually expelled from Castile for two years. </p>
      <p>In 1588 Lope married Isabela de Urbina from Madrid. Her
aristocratic family had opposed the marriage with the lowborn Lope. A
few weeks&nbsp;after the wedding, Lope joined the Invincible Armada.
During this period he wrote <em>La hermosura de Angélica</em>, which
had as its model <a href="ariosto.htm">Ariosto</a>'s <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>. </p>
      <p>Upon the defeat of Spain, Lope returned home penniless. He
settled with Isabela in Valencia, a lively city, where he began to work
seriously for the stage. From the mid-1580s, his plays had been
performed in Madrid&nbsp; but now he sent there new works every two
months. In 1590 he entered the service of the Duke of Alba, and
remained in Toledo until 1595. Isabella died in the spring of that
year, and Lope&nbsp;went to Madrid, where he was
prosecuted&nbsp;&nbsp;for an illicit relationship with Antonia Trillo.
He also wrote sonnets to Lucinda, a literary pseudonym for Micaela de
Luján, a mysterious beauty, who was his mistress from approximately
1598 to 1608. </p>
      <p>Lope married in 1598 Doña Juana de Guardo, daughter of a
wealthy butcher.&nbsp;When&nbsp;was appointed secretary to the Marqués
de Malpica and Marques de Sarría, his&nbsp;social position improved
considerably. In the&nbsp;following years Lope divided his time between
Seville, where Micaela and their children lived, and Madrid. His fame
as a dramatist had been established by the turn of the century. In 1598
Lope gained fame as a ballad writer with the pastoral romance<i> La
Arcadia,</i> However, he was soon forgotten by his public, after Philip
II closed the Madrid theaters&nbsp;in mourning for the death of his
daughter.&nbsp;Lope became in 1605 friends with the Duke of Sessa and
his confidential secretary. </p>
      <p>In 1610 Lope bought a house on the Calle de Francos (Street of
the Franks), where he lived until his death. The street was renamed
Calle de Cervantes in the nineteenth century; Cervantes was buried in
the Trinitarian Monastery on what was then the Calle de Cantarranas
(Street of the Singing Frogs), and now known as the Calle de Lope de
Vega. Doña Juana died in 1613 while giving birth to a daughter,
Feliciana. All her jewels were pawned;&nbsp;no valuables
were&nbsp;mentioned in her last will and testament.&nbsp; In
1614&nbsp;Lope entered a religious order and was appointed an officer
of the Inquisition. "Harmony is pure love, for love is complete
agreement," Lope&nbsp;said in <em>Fuenteovejuna</em> (c. 1613). Lope's
work as a playwright was not approved by the church, but he wrote many
of his <i>comedias </i>during his priesthood. Pope Urban VIII,
however, idolized him and made him Knight of Malta and doctor of
theology in 1627. </p>
      <p>Lope's success overshadowed Cervantes's attempts as a
playwright. "No one is so stupid as to admire Miguel de Cervantes," he
once said. In spite of his popularity, supporters in the nobility, and
productivity, Lope was troubled by financial problems. After an affair
with Jerónima de Burgos,&nbsp;Lope fell in love&nbsp;with a married
woman, Doña Marta de Nevares Santoyo, called "Amarilis" and "Leonarda"
&#8211; this time his indiscretions with her were criticized even by
Cervantes, who referred to his&nbsp;rival&nbsp;in his prologue
to&nbsp;Part II&nbsp;of <em>Don Quixote</em>: "I am&nbsp;not likely to
accuse a priest; above all&nbsp;if, in&nbsp;addition, he holds the rank
of Familiar&nbsp;of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on
behalf of his friend, he is entirely mistaken, for&nbsp;I worship the
latter's genius, his work, his constant and virtuous
employment."&nbsp;The&nbsp;underlying sarcastic meaning of&nbsp;the
phrase "la occupación contínua y virtuosa" was understood by those who
knew Lope's life. </p>
      <p>Lope's&nbsp;last great love,&nbsp;Amarilis, was stricken with
blindness and insanity; she died in 1632. His son Lope Félix drowned
off the coast of Venezuela in 1612, and&nbsp;his daughter, Antonia
Clare, was abducted by a courtier. Lope turned more and more to
religious contemplation and exercises, scourging himself so furiously
that he bloodied the walls of his room. He died in Madrid on August 26,
1635, more or less a pauper. Most of his large income was devoted to
charity and the church. His state funeral lasted for nine days. </p>
      <p>Lope claimed to have written a total of 1500 plays. His
productivity was phenomenal: he boasted that he had numerous times
composed a piece and brought it on the stage within 24 hours. Calderon
often&nbsp;borrowed his plots. Essentially he wrote two types of drama,
of which the <i>cloak-and-dagger </i>plays depicted contemporary
manners and intrigue, and historical plays based on national legends or
stories. The themes for his works Lope chose easily, according to the
taste of his audience. On several occasions he dealt with love and
honour. Some of his works were based on his own chaotic love life,
among them <i>Dorothy</i> (1632). It could be called a novel in
dialogue. The author himself tells us that Dorotea is written in prose,
that being a surer vehicle of truth to life than verse, when characters
are speaking. "I was born into two extremes, to love and to hate; I
have never had a middle way," Lope wrote; the words are adapted from a
verse by the Roman writer and actor Publius Syrus. </p>
      <p><span class="st"><em>El niño inocente de La Guardia</em><strong>
      </strong></span>was applauded because of its anti-Semitic theme.
Lope defended in this propaganda piece the Inquisition, which regarded
Judaism a major threat to the Christian world. In <em>La hermosa Ester</em>,
based on the book of Esther, the Jews are not the evil-doers; Lope ends
the play in happy celebration. <em>El Remedio en la Desdicha</em><strong>
      </strong>and <em>Pedro Carbonero</em> portrayed Moors
sympathetically, in accordance with popular sentiment. In <i>Fuenteovejuna</i>,
      <em>Peribázez</em>, and <em>El mejor alcalde, el rey</em> common
people and the king are&nbsp;on the&nbsp;same side&nbsp;against a
corrupt feudal nobility. <i>Fuenteovejuna</i>, depicting a peasant
uprising, was performed with great acclaim in the 1990s. </p>
      <p><em>La Dragontea</em> (1598), a historical epic, was directed
against Sir Francis Drake, the English hero who defeated the Spanish
Armada in 1588. Among Lope's heroic plays based on Spanish legends and
chronicles were <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>El último godo</em></span></span>,
dealing with Rodrigo,<em> <span class="ft">Las almenas de Toro</span></em>,
about El Cid, and <span class="st"><em>El bastardo Mudarra</em></span>,
about the legend of the seven infantes of Lara. The same tale by the
Italian Matteo Bandello, that inspired <em>Castelvines y Monteses</em>,
provided Shakespeare with the plot of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, though
Lope's version ends happily. Thomas Holcroft utilized&nbsp; <em>El
padre engañado</em> in his<i> Father Outwitted </i>(1805). Various
critics have denied through decades that <em>La Estrella de Seville</em>
was written by Lope de Vega, but according to Ford Madox Ford, "from
the purely literary standpoint it would seem rather obvious that the
pen that wrote the picaresque scenes of the Dorotea could also have
given us the &#8211; in effect romantic &#8211; episodes of the Estrella." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The March of the Literature</font></i><font size="2">, 1938) </font></p>
      <p>Lope's output included also pastoral romances, verse histories
of recent events, verse biographies of saints, prose tales, and poems.
Lope himself did not actively supervise the publication of his works
until 1617 in <i>Parte IX</i> of his <i>comedias</i>. Many of his
plays were printed and sold at the door of the theatre soon after the
performance. Don Nicolas Antonio&nbsp;gave in 1684 the contents of 25
volumes of the author's plays, printed originally in Madrid between the
years 1611 and 1630. A collection of Lope's non-dramatic works in verse
and prose published from 1776 to 1779 filled 21 volumes; it did not
sell well and the editor did not continue with the publication of the
dramatic works. </p>
      <p>Some of Lope's essential ideas were elaborated in <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>El Arte nuevo de hacer comedias</em><strong>
      </strong></span></span>(1609), a poetical essay, which was
originally published in the <em>Rimas</em> of Lope de Vega. The
principal characters for <i>comedia nueva</i> were defined as
violation of the Aristotelian unities (unity of action, time, and
place). Lope's&nbsp;recommendations were expressed&nbsp;in a practical
way:&nbsp;"The subject once chosen, write in&nbsp; prose, and divide
the matter into three acts of time, seeing&nbsp;to it, if possible,
that in each one the space of the day be not broken." Knowing<strong> </strong>what
appeals to the public, he stated: "Tragedy mixed with comedy and
Terence with Seneca . . . causes much delight." </p>
