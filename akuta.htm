<P>Short-story writer, poet, and essayist, one of the first Japanese modernists translated into 
English. Akutagawa published no full-length novel. He was a stylistic perfectionist, who 
often favored macabre themes. His short stories 'In a Grove' and 'Rashomon' inspired <A HREF="kuros.htm">Akira Kurosawa</A>'s classic film from 1950. In 1935, the writer's friend Kikuchi Kan established the Akutagawa Prize, which is generally considered among the most prestigious Japanese literary awards for aspiring writers. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;Yes, sir. Certainly, it was I who found the body. This morning, as usual, I went to cut my daily quota of cedars, when I found the body in a grove in a hollow in the mountains. The exact location? About 150 meters off the Yamashina stage road. It's an out-of-the-way grove of bamboo and cedars.&quot;</B> (from <I>Rashomon and Other Stories</I>, tr. by M. Kuwata, Takashi Kojima) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Akutagawa Ryonosuke was born in  Tokyo into a family which had lived for generations in the <I>shitamachi</I> district of Tokyo, famous for its cultural traditions. Shortly after Akutagawa's birth his mother, Fuku, became insane. His father, Niihara Toshizo, a dairyman, was not able to take care of his son, and  Akutagawa was adopted by his uncle,  Akutagawa Dosho, whose surname he assumed. In 1913 Akutagawa entered the Tokyo Imperial University, where he studied English, graduating in 1916 with a thesis on William Morris.  Throughout his life, Akutagawa remained a voracious reader of the Western novels. </P>
<P>While still at the university, Akutagawa started to write short fiction. His first literary work was a 1914 translation of Anatole France's <I>Balthasar</I> (1889). With his friends, Kikuchi Kan and Kum&#233; Masao, he founded the literary magazine <I>Shin Shicho</I>, where he published 'Rashomon' (or 'The Rasho Gate', 1915). The tale, set in 12th-century Kyoto, depicts a ruined city, where a former servant tries to survive and must choose between immorality and virtue.  The novelist Natsume Soseki was  impressed by Akutagawa's work and encouraged him in his writing. </P>
<P>After graduating Akutagawa took up teaching at a naval school in Yokosuka and married Tsukamoto Fumiko. Primarily Akutagawa wanted devote himself entirely to literature and refused invitations to teach at the universities of Tokyo and Kyoto. Eventually he resigned to become a full-time contributor to the<I> Osaka Mainichi </I>newspaper. During his most active phase in 1921, Akutagawa traveled to China as a correspondent, but due to health problems he was not able to write any articles there. </P>
<P>Akutagawa wrote almost all his central works in the ten years before his suicide. His early short pieces were carefully plotted historical tales, but toward the end of his short life, he focused more on his own emotional state and contemporary settings. Akutagawa gained first fame with  'The Nose' (1916), which drew on  <I>Tales of Times Now Past</I> (ca. 1107). In the Gogolian story a Buddhist monk troubled by his oversize, dangling nose. </P>
<P>European and Chinese literature was familiar for Akutagawa. He was a regular 
customer of Maruzen, Tokyo's foreign-language boohoo, and was interested in such Western 
writers as Strindberg, M&#233;rim&#233;e, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Baudelaire, and Tolstoy, 
all of whom he read in English translations. However, he never visited West, but his understanding of  Western literature was profound. In 'Cogwheels', he refers to two of his favorite authors: &quot;On  one of the shelves upstairs at Maruzen I found Strindberg's <I>Tale</I> and read a few pages while  standing there. It describes experiences not unlike my own. And it had a yellow cover. I put it  back and pulled out a thick book my hand happened to fall on. In it what should there be but an  illustration of cogs with eyes and noses not unlike human beings! It was a collection of pictures 
by inmates of a lunatic asylum assembled by some German. Even in my depression, my spirit could be  felt rising in rebellion and with the desperation of an addicted gambler kept opening book after 
book. Oddly enough, almost every book had clearly hidden stings in its sentences and illustrations. 
Every book? Even in <I>Madame Bovary</I>, which I had read many times before, I felt I was only the  bourgeois Monsieur Bovary in the end.&quot; (trans. by Will Petersen) In his autobiographical works  Akutagawa  also shows interest in the debate about socialism and social classes.  Japanese sources for his stories include<I> Konjaku monogatari</I>, works of Tokigawa, early Meiji anecdotes, and Christian writing as in &#145;'Kirishitohoro shonin-den&#146;, about the former Saint Christopher. </P>
<P>Akutagawa's accuracy in his expression is seen in the way he describes sensations (&quot;Only for an instant, on his dry lips he felt the touch of the butterfly wings. But years afterward, on his lips, the wing's imprinted dust still glittered.&quot;), everyday items (&quot;An iron wine bottle. Some time or other this finely incised wine bottle had taught him the beauty of <I>form</I>.&quot;), and milieus (&quot;Thirty years old, he had for some time been in love with a vacant lot. A ground of moss, on it broken bricks, fragments of roof tile. But in his eyes a landscape by Cezanne.&quot;) Akutagawa's style, poetic interpretation of his observations and nearly aristocratic aestheticism, connected him to the feeling and attitudes of remote generations of writers. However, he was not blind to the struggle of his own generation, and its radicalism, which can be read from his essay 'What is Proletarian Literature', written in 1927. Akutagawa prognosed that the bourgeoisie will sooner or later yield their position to the proletariat. </P>
<P>Akutagawa wrote some 150 stories several of which have been filmed. 'Rashomon' together 
with 'In a Grove' ('Yabunonaka'), about a rape-and -murder case in tenth-century Kyoto, formed the basis for Akira Kurosawa's famous film, which was unsuccessfully remade in Hollywood in 1964 under the title 'Outrage'. Many of Akutagawa's earlier pieces were set in the ancient Japan, but he brought into them a modern psychological point of view. 'Autumn' (1920), 'The Garden' (1922), and 'The House of Genkaku' (1927) represented his move toward realism. Often he depicted dark undercurrents of the mind and favored macabre themes. In the feverish 'Hell Screen' Akutagawa examined artistic creativity and asked the question, what happens if one is ready to break all moral rules to fulfil one's artistic goals, in this case to kill. The same idea of using a painter as a vehicle for horror, had been used by LeFanu and Poe. </P>
<P>The story is narrated in first person by a side character, an eyewitness of the events. Yoshihide, the protagonist, is a bad-tempered but great artist. His only daughter Yuzuki, gentle and devoted to his father, works as a maid for the Lord of Horikawa, who bids Yoshide to paint a picture of hell. The artist laborers day and night and his apprentices are in a constant state of terror because of his weird behavior. Finally he tells his lord that he cannot paint anything for which a model is lacking and one part remains unfinished: a carriage falls down through the sky. A court lady in it writhes in agony, her hair in disordered in the raging fire. After some days, the scene is arranged to the artist; a woman is burned but she is Yuzuki. &quot;Then, wonderful to say, over the wrinkled face of this Yoshihide, who had seemed to suffer on a previous occasion the tortures of hell, over his face the light of an inexpressible ecstasy passed, and forgetful even of his lordship's presence he folded his arms and stood watching. It was almost as if he did not see his daughter dying in agony. Rather he seemed to delight in the beautiful color of the flames and the form of a woman in torment.&quot; A month later the Hell Screen is completed and Yoshihide hangs himself in his studio. &quot;The first and most prevalent rumor was that he had burnt Yoshihide's daughter to death in resentment over thwarted love. But there was no doubt that it was the daimyo's purpose to punish the perversity of the artist, who was painting the Hell Screen, even if he had to kill someone to do so.&quot; </P>
<P>With a few exceptions, Akutagawa&#146;s last pieces in which he examined his own work and place 
in the world as an 
artist,  did not gain such success as his older tales. He began a literary debate 
with Junichoro Tanizaki on the 
Japanese novel, questioning the value of an "interesting plot" in favour of the "depth 
of poetic spirit". Tanizaki had written in an essay, 
that "I find myself interested only in fabrications, whether it be my own writings or those of others." 
Akutagawa committed suicide by taking an 
overdose of veronal on July 24, 1927, at the age of  thirty-five. He fell into sleep reading 
the Bible. </P>
<P>Paranoid and delusional, Akutagawa had  
suffered from visual  hallucinations, believing, among othe things, that  maggots were in his food. 
Six months before his death, Akutagawa's brother-in-law had killed himself to escape his debts; Akutagawa was expected to look 
after the family,  a burden, for which he did not have the strength. 
In his suicide note, entitled 'A Note to a Certain Old Friend', the author wrote: &quot;The world I am 
now in is one of diseased nerves, lucid as ice. Such voluntary death must give us peace, if not happiness. 
Now that I am ready, I find nature more beautiful than ever, paradoxical as this may sound. I have seen, 
loved, and understood more than others.&quot; Akutagawa's autobiographical works include 'The Early Life 
of Daidoji Shinsuke' (1925), which was left unfinished, 'A Fool's Life' (1927), and 'Cogwheels' (1927). 
His last important work, <I>Kappa</I> (1927), depicted supernatural water creatures (<I>kappa</I>), 
familiar from folklore. In the satirical story, an upside-down version of Japanese life, an inmate 
in a mental asylum, Patient No 23,  tells about his travels in an underground country, which he do no want to leave. 
Akutagawa wrote the story in less than two weeks, in a creative outburts before his death.
