      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->French author, literary
theoretician, and
representative of the <i>nouveau roman</i>. Alain Robbe-Grillet's work
lack the conventional elements, such as dramatic plotting, coherent
concept of time, and psychological analysis of the character. The
novels are composed largely of recurring images, impersonally depicted
physical objects and random events of everyday life. From his first
published novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Gommes</span>
(1953, The Erasers), Robbe-Grillet played with popular literary genres <font face="Symbol">-</font> several times with the traditional mystery
novel, perhaps the most conventional literary form. <i>The Erasers</i>
, which was based on the legend of Oedipus, mixes a detective story
with changing perspectives and abundant descriptions of natural objects
such as a tomato wedge. The book received the Fénélon Prize in 1954. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But you know there's no such thing
as the perfect crime; we must look for the flaw that has to exist
somewhere."</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">"Where are you going to look? Make no mistake
about it, monsieur: this is the work of specialists, they've obviously
left few things to chance; but what makes the few clues we have useless
is our inability to test them against anything else."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Erasers</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Alain Robbe-Grillet was born in Brest, Finistère, in
northwestern France, to a family of scientists and engineers. He
attended the Lycée de Brest, and the Lyceés Buffon and St. Louis.
During World War II he worked in a German tank factory. In 1944 he
received a diploma from the National Institute of Agronomy. Between the
years 1945 and 1949 he studied at the National Statistical Institute in
Paris, and then in 1949-51 at the Institute of Colonial Fruits and
Crops. Robbe-Grillet worked as an agronomist in Martinique, in the West
Indies, where he supervised banana plantations, and from 1955 as a
literary consultant at Les Editions de Minuit. The famous publishing
house <font face="Symbol">-</font> under the direction of Jérôme
Lindon (d. 2001) <font face="Symbol">-</font> also attracted such
writers as <a href="csimon.htm">Claude Simon</a>, <a href="sarraute.htm">Nathalie Sarraute</a>, <a href="butor.htm">Michel
Butor</a>, Jacques Derrida, and <a href="bourd.htm">Pierre Bourdieu</a>.
Although these writers had their own distinctive voice, they all
believed that the 19th-century social novel was dead. </p>
      <p>His first novel, <i>A Régicide</i>, Robbe-Grillet wrote while
working part-time in his sister's biology laboratory in 1949, but it
was not published until 1978. In 1951 he fell ill and wrote <i>The
Erasers</i>, which made him one of the leaders of the<i> nouveau roman </i>group.
It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Voyeur</span> (1955, The Voyeur), <span style="font-style: italic;">La Jalousie</span> (1957,
Jealousy), which Nabokov called one of the greatest novels of the
century, and the Kafkaesque  (1959, In the
Labyrinth). His statement of how he thought novels should be written
was published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pour un Nouveau Roman</span> (1963). "If in many of the
passages that follow, I readily employ the term New Novel, it is not to
designate a school, nor even a specific and constituted group of
writers working in the same direction; the expression is merely a
convenient label applicable to all those seeking new forms for the
novel, form capable of expressing (or of creating) new relations
between man and the world, to all those who have determined to invent
the novel, in other words, to invent man." <br>
 </p>
      <p>Robbe-Grillet argued that the writer should content himself
with the impersonal description of physical objects. Psychological or
ideological analysis should be excluded <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the reader must guess what hides under details and events. Robbe-Grillet's ideas had a crucial influence on the British born
artist Martin Vaughn-James, whose visual novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cage</span>
(1975), did not have human characters; their place had been taken by
clothes and other objects. In fact, they are ghosts of post-World War
II Britain.</p>
      <p>Despite its
focus on objective reality cleansed of human feeling, Robbe-Grillet
insisted, the nouveau roman is entirely subjective; its world is always
perceived through the eyes of a character, not an omniscient narrator.
"The true writer has nothing to say. What counts is the way he says
it," he once stated. In his essays <i>For a New Novel</i> (1963)
Robbe-Grilled condemned the use of metaphors, because they
anthropomorphize objects. This led to his attack on Jean-Paul Sartre
and Albert Camus, who, according to Robbe-Grillet, maintained 'a
dubious relationship' with the world. "All my work is precisely engaged
in the attempt to bring its own structures to light." </p>

      <p>Several of Robbe-Grillet's works, such as <i>The Voyeur</i>,
are mysteries in which the reader is left to solve the puzzle without
"authorized" explanation. The title of the work refers to Mathias, a
traveling watch salesman, who watches his wife obsessively. He is
perhaps is a rapist and a murderer, or his crimes are merely the
products of his imagination. The book was awarded the Critics' Prize
in 1955 but part of the jury thought that it was not a "novel" at all. <i>Jealousy</i>
is among the most famous<i> nouveaux romans</i> from the 1950s. It is
set on a banana plantation in the tropics, and it also takes a
detective-story-like theme. A husband spies on his wife and her alleged
lover Franck, their neighbor, through the openings of a Venetian blind
(jalousie in French). The plot is minimal and the nonexistent role of
the narrator is developed to the utmost limits. </p>
      <p>In<span style="font-style: italic;"> Djinn</span> (1981) Robbe-Grillet used another popular genre, the
spy-story. The protagonist works for an androgynous American spy, and
meets members of a secret society of latter-day Luddites dedicated to
fighting the supremacy of the machine. The narrator is unsure of the
external world; he is told that he is being dreamt, and after a while
the story begins to fold back on itself. The bizarre logic crystallizes
in an injured or perhaps dead child and remembers events that have not
yet taken place. "My syllables fall, too, awakening neither response
nor echo, like useless objects deprived of sense. And silence closes in
again. Have I really spoken? Cold, numbness, paralysis begin to spread
through my limbs." </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">La Maison de rendez-vous</span>
(1965), a parody of James Bond adventures, used several points of view,
which contradicted each other. The story, focusing on a evening get
together, folds back on itself various times. The apocalyptic <span style="font-style: italic;">Projet pour une révolution à New York</span>
(1970, Project for a Revolution in New York ) was written as if it were
a film or the journal of a director. Some reviewers noted that there is
no revolution in the novel, despite its title, failing to recognize its
allusions to underground activists. "Right or wrong New York represents
a place where, more than anywhere, nothing is natural any more,"
Robbe-Grillet said after the publication of the work, "where everything
is constantly transformed into myth." <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">La Belle Captive</span> (1975) was based
on the myth of the beautiful captive, and took its themes from the
paintings of the French surrealist René Magritte. <i>Snapshots</i>
(1962) included an artistic homage to the painter Gustave Moreau
(1826-98) in the story 'The Secret Room'. Its coldly narrated erotic
scene with a chained woman is filled with sexual violence <font face="Symbol">-</font> a trait which is typical of Robbe-Grillet's
later works. "The man is till standing about yard away, half leaning
over her. He looks at her face, seen upside down, her dark eyes made
larger by their surrounding eye-shadow, her mouth wide open as if
screaming. The man's posture allows his face to be seen only in a vague
profile, but one senses in it a violent exaltation, despite the rigid
attitude, the silence, the immobility."<font size="-1"> (from 'The Secret Room')</font> </p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Le miroir qui revient</span> (1984) was the
first volume of an autobiographical trilogy, <i>Romanesques</i>. In
his later works Robbe-Grillet acknowledged Claude Simon's dictum that "Everything
is autobiographical, even the imaginary". According to Robbe-Grillet,
life is not overtly meaningful or absurd, it is rather simple. The
theme of the labyrinth links Robbe-Grillet to Borges; they both share
the same fascination for interpretations inside interpretations.
Labyrinths are also the terrain of spy fiction, and in <span style="font-style: italic;">La Reprise</span>
(2001) a spy is sent to post-war Berlin on a mission which becomes for
him a sado-erotic experience. "All my novels are comic. Perhaps La
Reprise more so", Robbe-Griller once said of his best-selling book. </p>
      <p>Robbe-Grillet's emphasis on the visual world led him in the
1960s to writing scenarios and directing films. Some of his novels have
also been called <i>ciné-romans</i> (film-novels). These works have
challenged the limits of expected narrative structures and conventional
realism. Robbe-Grillet's thesis is that the physical world is the only
true reality, and the only way to approach memory is through physical
objects. The most famous dramatization of his literary theories is Alan
Resnais's film <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i>,
for which he wrote the
screenplay with a knowlege of Resnais's favorite tracking shots. Sacha
Vierny's task as a lightning cameraman was to realize the atmosphere of
a "sealed, stifling world," as Robbe-Grillet describet it, "... a
universe of marble and stucco, columns, mouldings, gilded ceilings,
statues, motionless servants ...." Vierny began in 1985 a series of
films with the British director Peter Greenaway, much influenced by <span style="font-style: italic;">Marienbad</span>. <font size="-1">(<span style="font-style: italic;">Making Pictures: A Century of European 
Cinematography</span>, 2003, pp. 264-267) </font><br>
 </p>
      <p>The puzzle without solution presents a luxurious country house
in which a stranger (Giorgio Albertazzi) meets a woman (Delphine
Seyring), who may or may not have had an affair with him the previous
year, perhaps in Marienbad, or somewhere else. The viewer never learns
whether the meeting took place. The perfectly sculptured silent
gardens, stately camera-work, and detached performances create a
dreamlike atmosphere; the tiny humans in the landscape cast shadows
while the manicured bushes do not. Are the persons the only "real"
figures in the story? Robbe-Grillet's other early films include <i>Trans-Europ-Express</i>
(1966), which circulated elements from Hitchcock films and gangster
movies. <i>L'Éden et aprés</i> (1971) started his color trilogy. In <i>Topology
of a Phantom City</i> (1976) Robbe-Grillet used freeze-frame technique
which he then set in motion. A French policeman investigates the death
of a prostitute. David is the perpetrator of the murder or murders that
have taken place. Sometimes David writes in first person. "I am alone.
Walking at random. Wandering, as if at random, among the unrecognizable
fragments of what were palatial homes, public buildings, private
residences, gaming houses and houses of prostitution, theatres,
temples, and fountains. I am looking for something." </p>
      <p>Robbe-Grillet was elected member of the prestigious Academie
Francaise in 2004. He died on 18 February, 2008, at the age of 85. </p>

others have paved way for the literary movement. Later echoes of the

Sontag in America, Christine Brooke-Rose, and Rayner Heppenstall in
England.</font></blockquote>
