      <p>Scottish lawyer, essayist, known for his two-volume biography <span style="font-style: italic;">The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</span>
(1791), published seven years after the death of its subject. Boswell
met <a href="samuelj.htm">Samuel Johnson</a> in May 1763 in Davies's
London bookshop and the two became fast friends. He recorded in detail
Johnson's words and activities in a relatively short period. Later the
historian Thomas Macaulay (1800-1859) called Boswell's worship of Dr.
Johnson "<i>Lues Boswelliana</i>, or disease of admiration." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"We cannot tell the precise moment
when a friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there
is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindness
there is at last one which makes the heart run over."</b> (from</font><i><font size="2"> The Life of Samuel Johnson</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
      <p>James Boswell was born in Edinburgh, the son of Alexander
Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, who was a judge in the supreme courts of
Scotland. Boswell's mother, Euphemia Erskine, was descended from a
minor branch of Scottish royalty. His family had had for two-and-a-half
centuries as its seat the estate of Auchinleck in Ayrshire. Near the
new mansion were the ruins of the Old Castle, which he eagerly showed
to Johnson and other friends. </p>
      <p>Much of his life Boswell was plagued by his mother's
suffocating Calvinism and his father's coldness. Lord Auchinleck
remarried in 1769. After his death in 1782, Boswell became the Master
of Auchinleck, but he never enjoyed his life there. </p>
      <p>At the age of 16, Boswell had a nervous breakdown, and he was
sent to recuperate to the border village of Moffat. For a long period
he was so afraid of ghost that he could not sleep alone. In one of his
journals Boswell wrote: "I do not recollect having had any other
valuable principle impressed upon me by my father except a strict
regard for truth, which he impressed upon my mind by a hearty beating
at an early age when I lied, and then talking of the <i>dishonour </i>of
lying." He attended the University of Edinburgh (1753-1753), where he
studied arts and law. He was already keeping a journal and writing
poems when he was 18. At 19 he made his first visit to London and a few
years later, on his second visit, Boswell met Dr. Johnson on 16 May,
1763, at Tom Davies's book shop. Boswell described the encounter in his
journal and later his journals, in which he recorded Johnson's
conversations, became the principal source for his biography. </p>
      <p>In 1759 Boswell's father send him to the University of Glasgow
to separate his son from an actress. Among his tutors there was Adam
Smith, the Professor of Moral Philosophy, whose advocacy of pure
English style impressed him deeply. After six months Boswell ran away
to London, where he embraced Roman Catholicism, planning to become a
monk. During his stay he met Laurence Sterne, the writer of <i>Tristram
Shandy</i>, and Edward, Duke of York, brother to Prince George, who
become King. Deciding the his future would be in London, he returned to
Edinburgh. The winter of 1763-64 he spent studying law in Utrecht,
Holland, and enjoying the company of a young lady named Belle de
Zuylen. After one term, Boswell left for a tour of Europe, meeting the
French intellectuals <a href="rousse.htm">Jean Jacques Rousseau</a>,
of whom he wrote a biographical sketch, and <a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a>.
Rousseau, who suffered from health problems, informed Boswell that he
has to use a catheter to control his bladder. While in Corsica he
become friends with General Pasquale Paoli. On a journey from Paris to
London, the exhausted Boswell wrote that he was seduced in coach and
inn 13 times by Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur, before they had
reched Dover. Moving back to Scotland in 1766, Boswell was admitted to
the bar and practised law in Edinburgh for 20 years. Although he first
attracted a fair number of clients, never earned enough to pay off
loans. He had also a reputation of being the defender of the poor and
the needy. </p>
      <p>Boswell had a phenomenal memory, he loved gossip, good
conversation, liquor, travel, and he was a natural writer. From 1760s
onwards, he had wrote anonymously various pamphlets and verses.
Moreover, throughout his life he was a passionate diarist. In 1768
Boswell published <span style="font-style: italic;">An Account of
Corsica</span>, based on his journey. The book, which was an immediate
success and earned him the nickname 'Corsica Boswell,' was a defence of
Corsica's abortive struggle for freedom against the republic of Genoa.
Rousseau had earlier sparked Boswell's zeal for the cause of Corsican
liberty. In 1769 Boswell appeared at a Shakespeare Jubilee dressed as a
Corsican chief, armed with stiletto and pistols. </p>
      <p>Boswell wanted to become known as a great lover. He told about
his adventures to his friends, William Temple and John Johnston, and
once claimed that he had made love five times in a single evening. He
was well-known among prostitutes in London's St. James Park <font face="Times New Roman">&#8211; </font>his sexuality was compulsive and he
copulated after watching public hangings, a favorite pastime, and after
personal bereavements. Over a period of 30 years he contracted
gonorrhea 17 times. In a poem about himself Boswell wrote: "Boswell is
pleasant and gay, / For frolic by nature designed; / He heedlessly
rattles away / When company is to his mind." He was very disappointed
when Catherine Blair, an heiress, rejected him and married a cousin,
Sir William Maxwell. Boswell wrote to William Temple: "The heiress is a
good Scots lass. But I must have an English woman. My mind is now twice
as enlarged as it has been for some months. You cannot say how fine a
woman I may marry, perhaps a Howard or some other of the noblest in the
kingdom." </p>
      <p>In 1769 Boswell married Margaret Montgomerie, his cousin; they
had two boys and three girls. From early on, he worried of her health
and that he would be left alone. Though his visits to London were
restricted to the vacations of the Court of Session, Boswell kept up
his contacts with Johnson, and was elected to the Literary Club in
1773. The members included some of the most famous men of the time,
such as the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds, the actor David Garrick, the
historian Edward Gibbon, and the political economist Adam Smith. With
Johnson, who described Boswell as "the best travelling companion in the
world", the friends made their celebrated tour of Scotland and the
Hebrides. "A page of my Journal is like a cake of portable soup. A
little may be diffused into a considerable portion." (from <i>Journal
of a Tour to the Hebrides</i>) The route followed that of the
unfortunate rebel, Prince Charles Edward. One of Johnson's motives to
undertake the journey was to investigate the authenticity of
Macpherson's Ossian poems; he was sure that they were fakes. </p>
      <p>Between the years 1777 and 1783 Boswell wrote for <i>The
London Magazine</i> a series of essays on such subjects as drinking,
diaries, and hypochondria. Boswell saw Johnson for the last time on 30
June, 1784. After Johnson's death in December, Boswell began to write <span style="font-style: italic;">The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span>,
published in 1785. It has been compared to a picaresque adventure,
where Johnson is Don Quixote and Boswell has the role of Sancho Panza.
Although reviews were good, it was questioned, was it right to reveal
Johnson's follies and whims and private conversations. "Authenticity is
my chief boast," answerd Boswell. Later this book was included in the <i>Life
of Johnson</i>, which breaks off at the point where <i>Tour</i> begins
and continues again where it finishes. </p>
      <p>Boswell moved to London, and although he was admitted to the
English bar, he concentrated on the writing of <i>The Life of Samuel
Johnson</i>. The work proceeded slowly, owing partly to Boswell's
drinking habit, fits of depression. and hypochondria. It took years to
gather material &#8211; letters, memoirs, interviews &#8211; and sort, select, and
edit it. In the editing, he was helped by the Irish scholar Edmond
Malone, a fellow-member of the Literary Club, with whom he had
collaborated in the <i>Tour</i>. Before Boswell finally published his <i>magnum
opus</i> on 16 May, 1791, he wrote a long poem,&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">No Abolition of Slavery; or, the Universal
Empire of Lov</span>e, in which he defended slavery. <i>The Life of
Johnson</i> was a commercial success despite its high price, and
reviews were favorable. "Perhaps no man was ever so perfectly painted
as you you have painted your hero," said Boswell's old friend William
Temple. However, Boswell's own literary skill's as a writer were not
recognized in the extraordinary vivid biography, and for a long time,
until the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Boswelliana</span>
(1874), he was labelled as a mere "stenographer." </p>
      <p>Boswell's remaining years were mainly unhappy, and he no
longer had a clear course for his life. Some of his frieds avoided him,
afraid that he would record their conversation &#8211; or perhaps that he
would not do it. Boswell's pursuit of a political career turned out to
be unsuccessful. His wife, who coughed and spitted blood while in
London, moved back to Scotland and after her death in 1789, he had
difficulties with his "Edinburgh-mannered" daughters, who did much as
they pleased. Boswell died in London, on May 19, 1795. His body was
taken to Auchinleck and laid in the family vault. </p>
      <p>According to a literary anecdote the first governor-general of
British India, Warren Hastings (1732-1818), was asked what he thought
of the<i> Life of Samuel Johnson</i>. "Sir," he replied, "it's the
dirtiest book in my library." Hastings himself was impeached for
corruption in his administration. Boswell's<i> Life of Samuel Johnson</i>
is perhaps the greatest biography in the English language. Boswell made
notes on the spot during Johnson's conversation and he questioned
Johnson's friends, transforming details into a lifelike portrait. In
this work Boswell was aided by Edmund Malone (1741-1812), an Irish
literary critic and Shakespearean scholar, who went over the final
draft of Johnson's biography. By flattering, cunning questions, and
demeaning himself, Boswell provoked Johnson into giving his best,
making him talk. Without diminishing the stature of Johnson, Boswell is
now considered not only a faithful recorder of an exceptional
personality, but the creator of a masterpiece. </p>
