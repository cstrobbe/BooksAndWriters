      <p>Novelist, poet, essayist, short-story writer, and playwright,
a central figure in modern Croatian literature. Krle&#382;a published his
first poems and plays before World War I. He was among Yugoslavia's
most prolific writers for almost seven decades. Krle&#382;a's most ambitious
work is the multi-volume novel <i>Zastave</i> (1967-). It paints a
panoramic overview, mixed with biographical reminiscences, of European
life between 1912 and 1922. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Philip stopped in front of the old
crumbling wall, feeling it with his hand, as if he were touching a dear
but forgotten grave. The wind and rain had washed away the corsets; the
plaster was flaking off the bricks; and only in one place a tiny blue
tongue of the coke flame flickered out from under the painted iron
stove: catching sight of the long-faded advertisement, Philip felt the
far-off, dead pictures melting away within him, and he seemed to be
confronting some immeasurably vast space alone."</b> (from </font><font size="2"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Return of Philip Latinowicz</span>, 1932) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Miroslav Krle&#382;a was born in Zagreb, Croatia, at that time in
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Upon finishing the lower grades of
secondary school in Zagreb, Krle&#382;a entered in 1908 a preparatory
military school in Peczuj. He attended the Lucoviceum military Academy
in Budapest and in 1912 he volunteered for the Serbian army. However,
his military career started ironically. Krle&#382;a was suspected by the
Serbs of being an Austrian spy. He was forced to return to
Austria-Hungary where he was arrested by the Austrians. Finally he was
deprived of his officer's rank and sent to the front of Galicia as a
common soldier. </p>
      <p>In his early literary career beginning in 1914, Krle&#382;a was an
idealist and a romanticist. After World War I Krle&#382;a returned to Zagreb
and devoted himself to writing. In 1919 he married Leposava Kangrga.
The war had shattered his illusions &#8211; his embittered prose and poetry
reflected his strong antiwar feelings. Krle&#382;a opposed the monarchist
régime of Yugoslavia and founded in 1919 <i>Plamen</i>, a left-wing
review. He was also in constant conflict with freemasons, nationalists
and clerics. In 1923 he founded <i>Knjizevna republica</i>, then <i>Danas
      </i>(1934), <i>Pecat</i> (1939), and in 1945 <i>Republika</i>.
Deeply impressed by the Soviet revolution he became attracted to
Marxist ideas, but not dogmatically. Krle&#382;a a was a member of the
Communist Party from 1918 until 1939, when he was expelled, after
publishing <i>Dijalekticki antibarbarus</i> (1939), in which he mocked
the orthodox Stalinists. <i>Izlet u Russiju</i> (1926) was Krle&#382;a's
account of his visit to the USSR. In the 1950s, Krle&#382;a's published two
books of memoirs, <i>Djetinjstvo u Agramu</i> (1952) and <i>Davni dani</i>
(1956). </p>
      <p>Krle&#382;a's early dramas, <i>Legenda</i> (1914), <i>Kraljevo</i>
(1918), and <i>Adam i Eva</i> (1922) reveal his transformation from a
young idealist into a socially conscious artist. Throughout his life
Krle&#382;a stood in the forefront of the struggle against petit-bourgeois
attitudes and backwardness in general. Krle&#382;a's plays are characterized
by straightforward dialogue and merciless revelation of social
injustice. The dramatic trilogy, <i>Gospoda Glembajevi</i> (1928), <i>U
agoniji </i>(1928), and <i>Leda</i> (1932), which depict the
disintegration of the Glembay family and the downfall of bourgeois
society, are considered his best. Krle&#382;a focused on individual members
of the family from various generations and on their climb to the top of
the Austro-Hungarian socio-economic elite, doomed by historical
processes. In <i>Gospoda Glembajevi</i> a young painter, Leone
Glembay, kills his stepmother after the bankruptcy of the family
estate, in <i>U agoniji Laura</i>, the granddaughter of the banker
Glembay's younger brother, commits suicide after disappointment in
love, and in <i>Leda</i> the characters deceive each other sexually
and otherwise. </p>
      <p>Krle&#382;a's importance as a leader of the socially oriented
writers grew steadily between the two world wars. Krle&#382;a produced most
of his best work during the period from the late 1920s to the
mid-1930s. <i>Povratak Filipa Latinovicza</i> (1932, The Return of
Philip Latinovicz) was a story of a Croatian artist, Filip, who returns
from Paris to his small native town on Croatia's Danubian plain. Filip
is haunted by traumatic childhood experiences, and tries to discover
the identity of his father, which turn his pilgrimage into a quest of
his own identity. Filip survives his while other characters die. He
realizes that corruption and dishonesty reign and gradually fades into
oblivion. "Paris had its Balzac and Zola; Dublin its Joyce; Croatia its
Krle&#382;a... one of the most accomplished, profound authors in European
literature," wrote <i>The Saturday Review</i>. </p>
      <p>In the poetry collections <i>Knjiga Lirike</i> (1932) and <i>Pjesme
u tmini</i> (1937) Krle&#382;a predicted the victory of Socialism. The
satirical novel <i>Banket u Blitvi</i>
(1938-1962) dealt with the
political situation in Europe in the interwar period in the imaginary
country Blitvian (a play on words on Litva, Serbo-Croatian for
Lithuania), where human rights are brutally violated. One of the main
settings is the Hotel Blitvania, which has been renovated as a
first-class hotel, but which has&nbsp; also functioned as a torture
prison. <i>Hrvatski bog Mars </i>(1922) was a short-story
collection. It depicted the miserable condition of the Croatian soldier
in the Austro-Hungarian army and exploitation of the peasants. <i>Balade
Petrice Kerempuha</i> (1936), written in the Kajkavian dialect, was a
satirical saga of Croatian history, overshadowed with suffering. </p>
      <p>During World War II Krle&#382;a remained in Zagreb but did not join
the partisans. As a writer he was silent but was still harassed by the
pro-Nazi Croatian government. He supported the post-war Communist
régime enthusiastically and was rehabilitated in 1952 by Marshal Tito
(1892-1980), prime minister and president of Yugoslavia from 1953.
Krle&#382;a was elected in 1947 vice president of the Academy of Science and
Art. In 1951 he was appointed director of the Croatian Institute of
Lexicography, he also was the editor-in-chief of the <i>Encyclopedia
Yugoslavia</i>. From 1958 to 1961 Krle&#382;a served as President of the
Writers' Union. </p>
      <p>Krle&#382;a supported Croatian national and cultural claims and
recorded his sceptical views on democratic progress in the Balkans in <i>Razgovori
s Miroslavom Krlezom </i>(1969). He wrote with enormous creative
energy, and defended his views fiercely and fearlessly. "Whether human
folly is the work of God or not, it does not diminish in practice," he
wrote in <i>On the Edge of Reason</i> (1938). "Centuries often elapse
before one human folly gives place to another, but, like the light of
an extinguished star, folly has never failed to reach its destination.
The mission of folly, to all appearances, is universal." Krle&#382;a's style
was baroque, he had a keen eye for color and his characters were
sketched masterfully and with delicate nuances. <br>
</p>
      <p>In his historical masterpiece <span style="font-style: italic;">Zastave</span> (1962-77) Krle&#382;a
used various modernist techniques paint a picture of the struggles that
were fought under different banners in the years during and after WW I.
Even though Krle&#382;a was
a Marxist himself, he expressed his disdain for Stalinism and all
totalitarian systems. After the communists took power, he was often
regarded with suspicion by his fellow Marxists. At the time of writing <span style="font-style: italic;">Zastave</span>,
he often noted in his diaries that his socialist and communist
contemporaries seem to have forgotten the past and consequently lost
direction in the present. Krle&#382;a died in Zagreb
on December 29, 1981. His plans to extend <span style="font-style: italic;">Zastave</span>
to indicate the death of the utopian dreams, that fuelled the Yugoslav
Communist Party in the early years, were never realized. <br>
