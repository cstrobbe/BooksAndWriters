      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Hungarian-American playwright,
director,
novelist, short-story writer, and journalist, whose reputation reached
its peak between the wars. Molnár wrote in all about
42 plays, in which he combined realism and romanticism, cynicism and
sentimentality. His earliest works show the influence of the Austrian
playwright <a href="schnitz.htm">Arthur Schnitzler</a>. Much of his
life Molnár spent away from his native country; he died in New York.
Molnár's novel, <i>The Paul Street Boys</i> (1907), is among the most
popular books in Hungary. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It
was there that Olga was then to encounter the materialization of the
impulses she had been, only half uncounsiously, struggling against for
six years; the spirit of evil purpose against which good contends; the
incarnation of the arch fiend in the attractive shape of a suave,
polished, plausible, eloquent man of the world, whose cynicism bridged
the years of married life; whose subtle suggestions colored afresh the
faded dreams which she believed faintly remembered, and believed would
come no more."</b> </font><font size="2">(from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Devil</span>, 1907</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Ferenc Molnár was born Ferenc Neumann in Budapest into a
well-to-do Jewish family. His father, Mor Neumann, was a famous
physician. At the age
of eighteen, Molnár began a career in journalism and then studied law
in Budapest and Geneva. He joined the editorial staff of the Budapest
newspaper <i>Budapesti napló </i>and changed his German name, to be
known as a Hungarian writer, which he was. In 1906 he married the journalist and painter Margit
Vészi; they divorced in 1910. She was the daughter of Jósef
Vészi, the editor-in-chief of <span style="font-style: italic;">Pester Lloyd</span>. Like Molnár, she came from a Jewish family. Later in life Molnár
converted to Christianity. </p>
      <p>At the age
of twenty-two, after writing a number of short stories, Molnár
published his first novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Az éhes
város</span> (The Hungry City).
Molnár's early plays were comedies, such as<span style="font-style: italic;"> A doktor úr</span> (1902) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Józsi </span>(pub. 1904). In 1907 he
gained fame as a novelist with <span style="font-style: italic;">A Pál
utcai fiúk</span> (The Paul Street Boys), a story about two rival
boy's gangs on the streets of Budapest. The gangs share the same <i>grund</i>,
a vacant plot, an "open country, grassland and the great plains," as
Molnár himself described it. "It is a spell of freedom and
boundlessness, this plot of ground that is hedged about by a rickety
fence on one side, and by rearing walls stabbing skywards, on the
other." In the story a weak little boy, Erno Nemecsek, shows his
devotion to his gang and sacrifices himself for it. Molnár's depiction
of the young people's psyches is expressed in poetic style, drawing
parallels between gang life and the contemporary problems. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Az ördög</span> (1907, The
Devil), taking its central idea from Faust and
dealing with marital infidelity, was staged in New York a year after
its Hungarian premiere. This comedy established Molnár's fame as one of
the
leading dramatists of his day. Molnár's great invention was to bring on
the stage a mysterious character, The Devil, who manipulates the
characters and can anticipate their thoughts. Molnár wrote the play for
Irén Varsányi, who was at that time Hungary's leading actress. Her
jealous husband, Illés Szécsi, a wealthy manufacturer, challenged him
to the duel, but it was eventually Molnár who spent two weeks in jail. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Liliom</span>,
perhaps
Molnár's most enduring achievement, failed first but it soon soon
gained international
success. The première in December 1909 at Budapest left critics a bit
bewildered. The hero is killed in the fifht scene but he is back on
earth in the seventh. After four screen adaptations the play become
eventually familiar as the
Rogers and Hammerstein musical <i>Carousel </i>(1944). Earlier also
the Italian composer Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924) had thought of setting
it to music. It has been said, that Molnár wrote the work after his
wife upbraided him
for slapping their daughter &#8211; the incident become a key to story, in
which it was justified. However, according to a family source this is
an untrue gossip, although there were episodes of domestic violence in
the family. Molnár had separated from Margit Vészi
before their daughter was born, and they never lived under the same
roof.<br>
</p>
      <p>Influenced by <a href="owilde.htm">Oscar Wilde</a>,
        <a href="pirandel.htm">Pirandello</a>, and <a href="gbshaw.htm">George
Bernard Shaw</a>, but with his own touch of wit
and grace, Molnár fused in <i>Liliom</i>
naturalistic scenes with mystical symbolism. Liliom, a barker and a
bouncer, is the main attraction at the Widow Muskat's carousel in the
Budapest City Park. Mrs Muskat is jealous of the young housemaid Julie,
and when Liliom defends her, he is fired. He moves with Julie in the
home of a relative. Liliom is warm-hearted but he has a quick temper.
He suffers because he cannot work at the carousel and in his anger he
strikes Julie. After an unsuccessful robbery, Liliom commits suicide.
Two "heavenly policemen" take Liliom to a celestial court. Liliom
refuses to admit his love for Julie and shows no regret for his sins.
He is sentenced to sixteen years of Purgatory for ill-treating his
family. In the last scene Liliom appears Julie and their daughter
disguised as a beggar. When his daughter Lujza refuses his gift, a
stolen star, he strikes her in desperation. The girl asks the mother if
it is possible to have been hit hard and yet feel as though one had
been caressed. Julie guesses the identity of the stranger, and Liliom
is taken away as a hopeless case by two detectives. "It is possible
dear &#8211; that someone may beat you and beat you and beat you, &#8211; and not
hurt you at all," says Julia.<font size="2"> </font></p>

      
      <p>During World War I Molnár served for a year as a war
correspondent.
His reports were published in book form in 1916 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Egy haditudósító naplója</span> (The Diary
of a War Correspondent). The warmhearted book records human
goodness and solidarity in the middle of the horrors of war. Some of
these writings
also appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, although Hungary belonged
to the enemies of the Allies. </p>
      <p>Between 1908 and 1940, sixteen of Molnár's plays were produced
on
Broadway. When he visited the United States with his wife in the 1920s,
he was honored with a dinner dance, at which guests included Gershwins
and Vanderbilts. Until 1925, he resided in Hungary, and then moved to
Germany. In Vienna he stayed in comfortable hotel for long periods, in
Budapest he was seen often at
the Café Central on Károlyi Mihály street. According to an anecdote,
the keys of the New York kávéház, where he wrote <i>Liliom</i>, he
tossed into the Danube in protest at its closing at night. <br>
</p>
      <p>Molnár's
most interesting plays from this decade include <span style="font-style: italic;">Játék a kastélyban</span> (1926, The
Play's the Thing),
which followed a Pirandellian theme of reality and illusion through a
discussion of how a play should be written. <span style="font-style: italic;">A hattyú</span> (1921, The Swan),
a comedy about a girl being groomed to marry a prince, was filmed in
1956 with Grace Kelly. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Olympia</span>
(1928) Molnár assailed the cruelty of
aristocracy toward the common man. <i>The Good Fairy</i>
(1930), had a recpectable run on Broadway. Its film version from 1935,
directed by William Wyler, and starring Margaret Sullavan and Herbert
Marshall, was written by Preston Sturges, who invented a new
beginning and damped down observations on marital
infidelity. Sullavan played a beautiful and naive young woman, who
disrupts the lives of three men. The film was a smash hit. It was
remade in 1947 as <i>I'll be Yours</i>. </p>

      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is a pity, that there are not
more
Fontannes, Lunts and Molnárs to help out the screen, for then this
medium of entertainment would be in a far higher plane."</b> (Mordaunt
Hall in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1938, after the <i>Anschluss</i>, Molnár fled to the
United
States (according to some sources 1936) to escape Nazi persecution. In
his new home country, he was celebrated for his masterly theatrical
technique and the sparkling dialogue of his characters, which at the
same time expressed a sense of humanity and
decency. His plays had hidden Freudian undertones, but at the end
Molnár usually shows his care about the morality of the decisions of
his bourgeois characters. Socially minded reviewers, on the other hand,
accused him of sentimentality, and emphasis on the savoir vivre of the
upper middle class, that waters down all social criticism. The major
exception was <i>Liliom</i>, which blended criticism of injustice with
fantasy. Underpaid workers and vagrants Molnár portrayed with great
sympathy.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It can be claimed that Molnár never wrestled with 
destiny, unlike the heroic struggles of the major playwrights: somehow he too 
seemed to be a victim of the cult of illusion so characteristic of the 
pseudo-Victorian Hungarian society. In Molnár world atmosphere is everything, 
and it would be difficult to substantiate social realities from his always 
amusing, unpredictable, and occasionally artistic dialogues."</b> </font><font size="2">(Lóránt Czigány </font><font size="2">in <i>The Oxford History of Hungarian 
Literature</i>, 1984) </font></blockquote>
      <p> </p>

      <p>Molnár held court in his suite at the New York Plaza Hotel,
and
continued writing, but he did not speak much English and he became
increalingly isolated. In Hungary his
plays were not performed during the Communist period. Molnár died on
April 2, in 1952. Because of a superstitious fear that in preparing a
will he would shorten his life, Molnár died intestate. His second wife
was the
the actress-singer Sári Fedák (1879-1955), who became a Nazi. They
divorced in 1925 and Molnár then married the
actress Lili Darvas (1902-1974); she began a succesful television
career in the 1950s. After the war, Sári Fedák was sentenced to prison
for a short period by the "People's Court". In the Communist Hungary
Molnár's works were
viewed with suspicion long after his death. Even in the 1980s Attila
Tamás wrote in <i>A History of Hungarian Literature</i> (1983): "He
had great talents as a dramatist, but he lacked the appreciation of the
noble human values necessary for true greatness." </p>
      <p>P.G. Wodehouse adapted <i>Game of Hearts</i> from a text by
Molnár, and also <i>The Play's the Thing</i>. Tom Stoppard adapted a
Molnár <i>Rough Crossing</i> in 1985, and <i>The Guardsman</i> was
made into a radio drama in 1947 by <a href="amiller.htm">Arthur Miller</a>.
In addition, a number of Molnár's plays and novels were turned into
Hollywood films, among them <i>No Greater Glory</i> (1934), a tale of
of schoolboys and their war games, <i>Liliom</i>, filmed several
times, and <i>The Swan</i>, first directed by Dimitri Buchowetzki in
1925, remade in 1930, and then again in 1956 by Charles Vidor, starring
Grace Kelly and Alec Guinness. </p>
      <p>Billy Wilder's satirical <i>One, Two, Three</i>, about
Coca-Cola, a raging capitalist, and Communism was based on Molnár's
play <span style="font-style: italic;">Egy, kett&#337;, három</span>
(1929). Wilder shot the film mostly in Germany.
Originally Molnár's single act play took place in the office of a
frenzied capitalist, Mr. Norrison, but Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond
practically left none of the dialogue intact in their screenplay.
Norrison's young female houseguest, Lydia, the daughter of an important
banking client, announces that she is going to marry a Socialist taxi
driver. The cabbie, Anton, is turned into a nobleman before the day is
through with the help of tailors, barbers, and shoe salesmen. "It must
be very wonderful, sir, to be as you are and have almost all mankind at
your disposal," says Norrison's aged servant. He answers: "But as
regards mankind, after what was just done here, I think mankind &#8211; or as
you so carefully put it, almost all mankind &#8211; should damn well be
ashamed of itself." </p>
