<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British writer, the creator of Sherlock
Holmes, who is the best-known detective in literature and the
embodiment of sharp reasoning. Doyle himself was not a good example of
rational personality: he believed in fairies and was interested in
occultism. Sherlock Holmes stories have been translated into more than
fifty languages, and made into plays, films, radio and television
series, a musical comedy, a ballet, cartoons, comic books, and
advertisement. By 1920, Doyle was one of the most highly paid writers
in the world.</p>
      <blockquote><font color="White" size="2"><b>--</b></font><b><font size="2">'This is indeed a mystery,' I remarked. 'What do you imagine
that it means?' </font><br>
        <font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">'I have no
data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data.
Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
theories to suit facts...' </font></b><br>
        <font color="White" size="2">--</font><font size="2">(from 'A
Scandal in Bohemia', 1891) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Arthur Conan Doyle was born at Picardy Place, Edinburgh, the
son of Charles Altamont Doyle, a civil servant in the Edinburgh Office
of Works, and Mary (Foley) Doyle. Both of Doyle's parents were Roman
Catholics. To increase his income, Charles Altamont painted, made book
illustrations, and also worked as a sketch artist on criminal trials.
Not long after arriving Edinburgh he began to drink and suffered at the
same time from epilepsy, he was eventually institutionalized. Richard
Doyle (1824-83), the uncle of A.C. Doyle and the son of the
caricaturist John Doyle, was also an illustrator. He worked for <i>Punch</i>
and illustrated chiefly fairy stories, including Ruskin's <i>The King
of the Golden River</i>, W. Allingham's <i>In Fairyland</i> and some
of Dickens's Christmas Books. </p>
      <p> Doyle's mother, Mary, whom he called "the Ma'am," was
interested in literature, and she encouraged his son to explore the
world of books. Doyle's second wife, Jean, said: "My husband's mother
was a very remarkable and highly cultured woman. She had a dominant
personality, wrapped up on the most charming womanly exterior." At the
age of fourteen Doyle had learned French so that he could read <a href="verne.htm">Jules Verne </a>in the author's original language.
Charles Altamot died in an asylum in 1893; in the same year Doyle
decided to finish permanently the adventures of his master detective.
Because of financial problems, Doyle's mother kept a boarding house.
Dr. Tsukasa Kobayashi has alluded in an article, that she had a long
affair with Bryan Charles Waller, a lodger and a student of pathology,
who had a deep impact to Conan Doyle. He also supported young Arthur
financially. Mary's last child was named Bryan Julia Doyle &#8211; perhaps
referring to Waller's mother, who also was Julia. </p>
      <p>Doyle was educated in Jesuit schools. During this period Doyle
lost his belief in the Roman Catholic faith, but the training of the
Jesuits influenced deeply his thought. Later he used his friends and
teachers from Stonyhurst College as models for his characters in the
Holmes stories, among them two boys named Moriarty. Doyle studied at
Edinburgh University and in 1884 he married Louise Hawkins. </p>
      <p>Doyle qualified as doctor in 1885. After graduation Doyle
practiced medicine as an eye specialist at Southsea near Porsmouth in
Hampshire until 1891 when he became a full
time writer. His first story, an illustrated tale of a man and a tiger,
Doyle had produced at the age of six. Doyle's first novel about Holmes,
      <span style="font-style: italic;">A Study in Scarlet</span>, was
published
in 1887 in <i>Beeton's Christmas Annual</i>. The story was written in
three weeks in 1886. It introduced the detective and his Sancho Panza
and Boswell, Dr. Watson, the narrator. Their major opponent, the evil
genius Dr. Moriarty, became a kind of doppelgänger of the detective.
Also the intrigues of the beautiful opera singer Irene Adler caused
much trouble to Holmes. </p>
      <p>The second Sherlock Holmes story, The Sign of the Four', was
written for the <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>. Doyle collected a
colorful group of people together, among them Jonathan Small, who has a
wooden leg and a dwarf from Tonga islands. The <i>Strand Magazine</i>
started to publish 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' from July 1891.
Holmes's address at Mrs. Hudson's house, 221B Baker Street, London, is
perhaps the most famous London street in literature. </p>
      <p>Already at the end of 1891, Doyle planned to abandon the
series. "I have had such an overdose of [Holmes] that I feel towards
him as I do toward <i>pâté de foie gras</i>, of which I once ate too
much, so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day", he
confessed. In 1893 Doyle devised
his death in the 'Final Problem,' published in the <i>Strand</i> in
the December issue. Holmes meets Moriarty at the fall of the
Reichenbach in Switzerland and disappears. Watson finds a letter from
Homes, stating "I have already explained to you, however, that my
career had in any case reached its crisis, and that no possible
conclusion to it could be more congenial to me than this." In his diary
Doyle wrote simply, "Killed Holmes", without understanding that his
creation was already indestructible. </p>
      <p>Doyle's readers expressed their disappointment by wearing
mourning bands and<i> Strand </i>lost 20,000 subscriptions. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hound of the Baskervilles</span>
(1902) Doyle narrated an early case of the dead detective. The
ingenious murder weapon in the story is an animal. Because of public
demand Doyle resurrected his popular character in 'The Empty House'
(1903). "I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I
turned again Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study
table. I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter
amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first
and last time in my life." <font size="2">(from 'The Empty House') </font></p>
      <p>In these following stories Holmes stopped using cocaine.
Although Doyle's later works have been criticized, several of them,
including 'The Three Garridebs,' 'The Adventure of the Illustrious
Client,' and 'The Veiled Lodger,' are highly enjoyable. Sherlock Holmes
short stories were collected in five books. The first
appeared in 1892 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</span>. It was followed by<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes </span>(1894),
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Return of Sherlock
Holmes&nbsp;</span> (1904),<span style="font-style: italic;">
His Last Bow</span> (1917), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes </span>(1927).</p>
      <p>During the South African war (1899-1902), Doyle served for a
few months as senior physician at a field hospital, and wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The War in South Africa</span>, in which
he defended England's policy. The same uncritical attitude toward the
British empire marked his history of World War I, <span style="font-style: italic;">The British Campaign in France and Flanders</span>
(6 vols.). Doyle was knighted in 1902 and in 1900 and 1906 he also ran
unsuccessfully for Parliament. Fourteen months after his long-invalided
wife Louisa died, Conan Doyle married in 1907 his second wife, Jean
Leckie. When his son Kingsley died from wounds incurred in World War I,
the author dedicated himself in <a href="http://www.nucleus.com/%7Egateway/doyle.html">spiritualistic
studies</a>. An example of these is <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Coming of Fairies</span> (1922). But he had already shown interest in
occult fantasy before publishing Holmes stories. In his early novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mystery of Cloomber </span>(1888), a
retired general finds himself under assault by Indian magic. </p>
      <p>Doyle supported
the existence of "little people" and spent more than a million
dollars on their cause. The so-called "fairy photographs" caused an
international sensation, when Doyle published a favorable account of
them in 1920. The photographs, taken by two schoolgirls, showed fairies
dancing in the air. A year after, the <i>Star</i> newspaper reported
that the fairies were from a poster, but the hoax was not uncovered
until the early 1980s, when the English photographic scientist Geoffrey
Crawley tested the Cottingley fairies and tenderly revealed the secret
behind the two poetic pictures: the artistically gifted cousins had
copied fairy illustrations from a book. &#8211; Doyle, a true believer in
spiritual powers, became president of several important spiritualist
organizations. In 1925, he opened the Psychic Bookshop in London. His
friends included the legendary American magician and escape artist
Harry Houdini (1874-1926). Doyle believed that Houdini possessed
supernatural powers, which the magician himself denied. Another friend
was D.D. Home. According to Doyle, he could levitate. Once Doyle
claimed, that Home "floated out of the bedroom and into the sitting
room window, passing seventy feet above the street." His own psychic
experiences Doyle recorded in <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Edge of Unknown</span> (1930), in his last book. Doyle died from heart
disease on July 7, 1930, at his home, Windlesham, Sussex. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"My contention is that Sherlock
Holmes </b></font><b><i><font size="2">is</font></i><font size="2">
literature on a humble but not ignoble level, whereas the mystery
writers most in vogue now are not. The old stories are literature, not
because of the conjuring tricks and the puzzles, not because of the
lively melodrama, which they have in common with many other detective
stories, but the virtue of imagination and style. They are fairy-tales,
as Conan Doyle intimated in his preface to his last collection, and
they are among the most amusing of fairy-tales and not among the least
distinguished."</font></b><font size="2"> (Edmund Wilson in </font><i><font size="2">Classics and Commercials</font></i><font size="2">, 1950) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Conan Doyle's other publications include plays, verse,
memoirs,
short stories, and several historical novels and supernatural and
speculative fiction. His
stories of Professor George Edward Challenger in<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Lost World </span>(1912) and other
adventures blended science fact
with fantastic romance, and were very popular. The model for the
professor was William Rutherford, Doyle's teacher from Edinburgh.
Doyle's practice, and other experiences, expeditions as ship's surgeon
to the Arctic and West Coast of Africa, service in the Boer War,
defenses of George Edalji and Oscar Slater, two men wrongly imprisoned,
provided much material for his writings. </p>
      <p>Sherlock Holmes's literary forefather was <a href="/eapoe.htm">Edgar
Allan Poe</a>'s detective C. Auguste Dupin and on the other hand
a real life person, Conan Doyle's teacher in the University of
Edinburgh,
Joseph Bell. A master of observation and deduction, he was a legend at
the medical school. Another model was Eugène Francois Vidoq, a former
criminal, who became the first chief of the Sûreté on the principle of
'set a thief to catch a thief.' Holmes's character have inspired many
later writers to continue his adventures.
Among them are O. Henry, Robert L. Fish and Nicholas Meyer with his
novels
      <i>The Seven-Per-Cent Solution</i> (1975) and <i>The West End
Horror </i>(1976). Philip José Farmer's <i>The Adventure of the
Peerless Peer</i> (1974) pastiched the Sherlock Holmes saga in the
context of his World Newton Family series. Robert Lee Hall portrays in
his novel <i>Exit Sherlock Holmes</i> (1977) Moriarty as Holmes's evil
alter ego. In <a href="/rohmer.htm">Dr. Fu Manchu</a> novel <i>Ten
Years Beyond Baker Street</i> (1984) the Evil Doctor fights Sherlock
Holmes. Roger Zelazny's <i>A Night in the Lonesome October</i> (1993)
features Holmes in a bit part. Perhaps the best actor who ever played
Sherlock Holmes was not Basil Rathbone but Jeremy Brett (1935-1995).
Brett devoted himself entirely to the role in a television series
produced by Granada TV from 1984 to 1994. The tv scripts were very
faithful to original stories.</p>
