<p>Argentine writer and motion-picture scriptwriter, who gained international fame with the publication of <i>Kiss of the Spider Woman</i>
(1976), a dialogue of seduction and manipulation, which was also
adapted into a movie and a musical. The story, set in a small cell in
the Villa Devoto prison in Buenos Aires, depicts two prisoners &#8211; one a
young political radical, the other a middle-aged homosexual. At first
they have nothing in common, but eventually they develop a strong
relationship through retelling romantic plots of old movies. In total,
Puig wrote eight novels. He died at the age of fifty-seven. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"How they spoiled me too much as a kid,
and that's why I'm the way I am, how I was tied to my mother's apron
strings and now I'm this way, and how a person can always straighten
out though, and what I really need is a woman, because woman is the
best there is."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Kiss of the Spider Woman</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Juan Manuel Puig was born in General Villegas, in the remote
Argentine pampas, the first child of María Elena Delledonne and
Baldomero Puig. His father tried for success in the livestock and dairy
business but failed. However, he struggled hard to build up capital and
achieve middle-class status. Puig spent his childhood in Villegas and
received there his elementary education. As young boy he used films as
an escape from his environment &#8211; he liked to dress up as a girl and at
school he was assaulted. "I grew up on the pampa in a bad dream, or
rather a bad western," he once said. Later in life he had a video
library of some 3,000 films. In 1946 Puig moved to Buenos Aires, where
he attended US boarding school; he had learned English from films. Puig
first studied architecture and changed to philosophy in 1951 at the
University of Buenos Aires. </p>
<p>In 1955 Puig went to Rome after receiving a scholarship to study
film directing and film technique with Vittorio De Sica and Cesare
Zavattini at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. After a period
he realized that film making at the commercial Cinecittà was not to his
tastes. Disappointed he traveled to Paris and London, earning his
living as a teacher, and dishwasher. In 1959 he lived in Stockholm and
then returned to his home country. From 1957 to 1961 Puig worked an
assistant film director and translator of subtitles in Rome, Paris, and
Buenos Aires. During this time he had begun to write film scripts.
While working for Air France from 1963 to 1967, he moved to New York
City to see Broadway musicals. Later he worked as a lecturer at
Columbia University, New York. Puig returned to Buenos Aires in 1967. </p>
<p>In 1973-75 Puig lived in Brazil, then in New York (1976-80). He did
not stay in Argentina many years. Never a Peronist and at odds with the
Latino tradition of machismo, he felt the atmosphere of his home
country oppressing. When Argentina's dictator Juan Perón died in office
in 1974, and was succeeded by his third wife Isabel Péron, Puig became
even more critical with the current policy. Due to Isabelita Perón's
personal intervention, he had received no royalties for the film of <i>Heartbreak Tango</i>, and his works were attacked in the press. In the 1980s Puig lived in New York and Rio de Janeiro. His play,<span style="font-style: italic;"> El misterio del ramo de rosas</span>
(1987, Mystery of the Rose Bouquet) was produced in a London theatre in
1987, but a fire in the theatre ended its performances. After spending
years ''in an unsuccessful search for a good husband," he settled in
1989 in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Puig died in Cuernavaca on July 22, 1990. </p>
<p>Puig translated most of his works into English and also wrote in
that language. His sevaral awards include the Curzio Malaparte Prize,
which he received in 1966 and San Sebastian Festival Jury Prize in 1978
. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It's just a romance. But it's so beautiful." </b>(from the film </font><i><font size="2">Kiss of the Spider Woman</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Puig's first novel, the semi-autobiographical<span style="font-style: italic;"> La traición de Rita Hayworth</span>
(1968, Betrayed by Rita Hayworth), portrayed the realities of Argentine
life. Although there is no specific social criticism, the tone of the
novel was an indirect comment on the years in which the Argentine
populist politician Juan Perón was climbing to power. The protagonist
is a young boy, who escapes his boredom by fantasizing about the lives
of the stars he has seen in motion pictures. "At another level, <i>Betrayed</i>
is a record of the oral languages spoken by a very definite segment of
the Argentinean people during a period of the country's history. If the
emotional and even the imaginative alienation of the characters is
shown through their way of elaborating fables out of books or movies,
their everyday speech demonstrates how deep the roots of that
alienation have gone, because it is a tissue in which is imbedded the
contemporary language of serialized novels, popular biographies, soap
operas, movie subtitles, plus the rhetoric of the politicians and the
pseudo-intellectual utterances of journalists." <font size="2">(from <i>World Authors 1975-1980</i>, ed. by Vineta Colby, 1985)</font> <span style="font-style: italic;">Boquitas pintadas</span>
(1969, Heartbreak Tango) was also set in a fictive small town, Colonel
Vallejos, where illusions and reality collide. Puig used the form of
romance novels, added in letters, newspaper clippings, excerpts from
diaries, police reports, and other things. All the material is tied
together with narrative tricks inspired by movies. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sangre de amor correspondido</span>
(1982, Blood of Requited Love) focused on the later experiences of two
teenage lovers, Maria, a young woman, and Josemar, a construction
worker. They spend one night together in a hotel, but Josemar doesn't
tell Maria that he is going to abandon her that night. Like <i>Kiss of the Spider Woman,</i> <span style="font-style: italic;">Maldición eterna a quien lea estas páginas</span>
(1980, Eternal Curse on Readers of These Pages) was built on dialogue.
Two cultures and opposites meet: Mr. Ramirez, an Argentine invalid, and
Larry, a writer who is paid to push his wheelchair. In their search for
a common language like characters in a <a href="beckett.htm">Beckett</a>
play, Ramirez tells how he knows what nervous breakdown, depression,
euphoria signify, but he doesn't know what these words mean. "But maybe
I haven't experienced them lately, so I understand them only up to a
point..." </p>
<p>Puig was a pessimistic observer of the human race &#8211; several of his
characters die or live their lives totally disillusioned like Toto, the
child-protagonist of <i>Betrayed by Rita Hayworth</i>, or Molina, who
is immersed in the fantasy world of the movies, and killed by
Valentin's friends. "Of all the writers I have known, the one who
seemed least interested in literature was Manuel Puig (1932-90)," <a href="vargas.htm">Mario Vargas Llosa</a> wrote in <i>The New York Times</i> (<font size="2">August 13, 2000)</font>.
"He never talked about authors or books, and when a literary topic came
up in conversation he would look bored and change the subject." Because
Puig's novels explored sexuality and he did not hide his sexual
orientation, in his own country he was much criticized for his
controversial stand. Puig had a number of relationships. According to
Suzanne Jill Levine's biography, Puig's homosexual "conquests''
included the actors Stanley Baker and Yul Brynner. </p>
<p>During his career Puig suffered many disappointments, among others the "massacre" of the off-Broadway musical version of <i>Kiss of the Spider Woman</i>.
Also the conservative film version, directed by Hector Babenco,
starring William Hurt, Raul Julia, and Sonia Braga, failed to capture
the spirit of the novel. According to some sources, Hurt's part was
originally offered to Burt Lancaster, but he had to withdraw because of
a heart operation. "La Hurt is so bad she probably will win an Oscar,"
Puig himself said. He started his book with the classic horror movie <i>Cat People</i>
by Jacques Tourneur (1942), a poetical film about double life,
sexuality, and an old curse. Schrader and Babenco invented purely
imaginary films to intervene with the narrative. Some critics
considered John Hurt's performance as Molina artificial, but he won a
Best Actor Oscar. Molina is a homosexual. He is accused of an ugly
crime &#8211; child molestation. The warden has offered Molina a reward if he
can get his cellmate Valentin to reveal the secrets of his companions.
Eventually the men make love. </p>
