<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>



<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British writer and composer, master of fast-paced, tongue-in-cheek mystery novels, a blend of <a href="jdcarr.htm">John Dickson Carr</a>, <a href="minnes.htm">Michael Innes</a>,
M.R. James, and the Marx Brothers, as the critic Anthony Boucher once
described. Crispin's nine humorous Gervase Fen novels are among the
most individualistic works of the genre. Crispin was a product of the
University of Oxford &#8211; his friend during university years was <a href="amis.htm">Kingsley Amis</a>
(1922-1995), who also loved detective stories and wrote one James Bond
adventure. Under his own name, Bruce Montgomery, he wrote the scores
for almost 50 feature films. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Crispin's work is marked by a highly
individual sense of light comedy, and by a great flair for verbal
deception rather in the Christie manner... At his weakest he is
flippant, at his best he is witty, but all his work shows a
high-spiritedness rare and welcome in the crime story."</b></font><i><font size="2"> </font></i><font size="2">(Julian Symons in </font><i><font size="2">Bloody Murder, </font></i><font size="2">1985) </font></blockquote>
<p>Edmund Crispin was born Robert Bruce Montgomery in Chesham Bois,
Buckinghamshire, of Scots-Irish parentage. He was the son of Robert
Ernest Montgomery, a government official, and Marion Blackwood Jarvie
Montgomery. Crispin was educated at the Merchant Taylor's School in
London. Before World War II he traveled around Europe, particularly
Germany. In 1943 Crispin received his B.A. from St. John's College,
Oxford, where read modern languages. When ankle problems kept him from
playing sports, he turned to writing and music. In 1942 he read John
Dickson Carr's novel <i>The Crooked Hinge</i>, a locked room mystery, which altered his view about 
detective stories and inspired him to create his own  detective. The character in 
Michael Innes's <i>Hamlet, Revenge!</i> (1937) called Gervase Crispin gave him the surname of his pseudonym and his detective's first name. </p>
<p>From 1943 to 1945 Crispin worked as a schoolmaster at Schrewsbury
School. His friend, the poet and novelist Philip Larkin (1922-85),
worked nearby; they read each other's texts and Crispin also dedicated
his third book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Moving Toyshop</span>
(1946), to Larkin. "Bruce was one the few people &#8211; in fact I can't
think of anyone else, that really brught new delights into my life, and
was always likely to find something fresh and rell me about it," Larkin
said decades later. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Case of the Gilded Fly </span>(1944),
published by Gollancz, introduced Crispin's series character Gervase
Fen, a cynical Oxford professor. It was written while he was still an
undergraduate. The figure was partly based on the Oxford professor W.E.
Moore, added with some of the characteristics of the author himself.
Also the deaf and eccentric Professor Wilkes, the narrator, becomes
familiar to the reader. In the story famous but fading playwright
Robert Warner goes to Oxford University to mount his latest
experimental drama in the college repertory theatre. One of the
actresses dies, her body is left at his door. Circumstances point
neither accident nor suicide or murder &#8211; it is an impossible murder.
Most of the action is seen through the eyes of Nigel Blake, a
combination of the names of the author <a href="nblake">Nicholas Blake</a> and his detective Nigel Strangeways. </p>
<p>The critic and mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included <i>The Moving Toyshop</i><b> </b>  in 1987 among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. "The word to describe <i>The Moving Toyshop</i>
is 'rococo'. It possesses in splendid abundance the ebullient charm of
the works of art thus labelled. It is alive with flourishes. Its
mainspring the actual disappearance of a toyshop visited in midnight
Oxford, has all the right fancifulness, and at the end it is explained
with perfect plausibility." <font size="2">(Keating in </font><i><font size="2">Crime and Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font>Poet
Richard Cadogan, arriving in Oxford for a holiday, finds a dead woman
in a room above toyshop. A blow from a blunt instrument hits him
unconscious. When he recovers, the dead woman has disappeared and the
toyshop has turned into a grocery store. Police do not believe
Cadogan's story and he contacts Gervase Fen. "After all," Professor Fen
says to the poet, "it's somewhat unusual business, isn't it." "So
unusual," says the pot, "that no one in his sense would invent it."
Professor Fen immediately finds a clue: a telephone number written on a
piece of paper. </p>
<p>Basically Gervase Fen, a Professor of English Language and
Literature at Oxford University, do not solve impossible crimes with
logic but with his intuitive ability, and partly because he is aware
that he is a fictional type. He is tall, about 40, with cheerful,
clean-shaven face, dark hair plastered down with water. Usually he
wears an enormous raincoat with extraordinary hats. Fell is happily
married, he drives a red roadster, without worrying about speeding
tickets. His favorite expostulations "Oh, my paws!" and "Oh, my furs
and whiskers!" derive from Lewis Carroll. Fen cooperates with Inspector
Humbleby, a policeman. He is interested in literature &#8211; perhaps more
than solving crimes. </p>
<p>Crispin was one of the last representantives of the Golden Age of
British detective fiction. At the same time, he both parodied the
conventions of the genre, and drew from it. During a nine year period
(1944-1953) he published eight novels, establishing his reputation as a
major writer of mysteries. Crispin combined farcical situations with
literary references, coincidences with nearly postmodern
self-awareness, inappropriate behaviour and sharp observations of the
language of various classes and professions. In <i>The Moving Toyshop</i>
Crispin lets a truck driver preach "industrial civilization is the
curse of our age... We've lorst touch with Nachur. We're all pallid...
We'we lorst touch with the 'body.'" </p>
<p>Crispin's professional music career began in mid-1940s. Music also inspired the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Swan Song</span> (1947), in which a badly behaving bass from the cast of Richard Wagner's opera  <i>Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg</i>
is killed. The murder is not the tenor. Crispin defends Wagner's
operas, which were sometimes assocoated in post-war England with the
Nazis. There is also a vague hint that Gervase Fen had been involved in
the murder investigation of Hitler. </p>
<p>Since the age of fifteen Crispin had played piano &#8211; in his youth he
worked as an organist and choirmaster. Crispin composed under his own
name, Bruce Montgomery, choral and orchestral works, songs, and several
scores for Gerald Thomas's <i>Carry  On </i> series and movies based
on Richard Gordon's humorous novels. In addition, he wrote the original
music for such feature movies as <i>Eyewitness </i>(1956), <i>The Truth About Women</i> (1957), <i>Heart of a Child </i>(1958), <i>Home is the Hero </i>(1959), <i>No Kidding </i>(1960), <i>Too Young to Love</i> (1960), <i>Raising the Wind</i> (1961), <i>Twice Round the Daffodils</i> (1962), and<i> The Brides of Fu Manchu </i>(1966),
which was his final film work. Crispin's old mentor Philip Martell
conducted the score. Most of his compositions were published in the
1940s and early 1950s. In 1956 he wrote music for a television film
called <i>The City  &#8211;  Cairo</i>, but the film was never shown. After he withdrew from writing the score for <i>Follow That Horse</i> (1960), Stanley Black was engaged to compose it. </p>
<p>Upon the story  collection, <span style="font-style: italic;">Beware of the Train</span>
(1953) Crispin stopped writing novels for many years. In a hilarious
story, 'We Know You're Busy Writing, But We Thought You Wouldn't Mind
If We Just Dropped In for a Minute' (1969) the narrator tries to finish
a sentence, "His crushed had, paining him less now, nevertheless gave
him a sense of..." but is constantly interrupted by visitors and phone
calls. Growing weary of the city, he built a bungalow in Devon, and
settled down to a quiet country li fe, collected classical records, and
took an interest in church matters. Succeeding Julian Symons, he
reviewed crime fiction for the Sunday <i>Times</i> from 1967 regularly. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Glipses of the Moon </span>(1977),
set in the Devon countryside, was the last Gervase Fen mystery. Engaged
in writing a book about British novelist and lonely, Fen talks to a
cat, and decides to write a novel of his own, called <i>A Manx Ca (287)</i>,
but "then it all dissolves into farce," as Crispin says in the story.
Generally reviewers praised its humor, wit, and the use of language,
overlooking Crispin's frivolity with twists and turns of the plot, and
his over-the-top characters, including a hunter "with waist-lenght
hair, who was wearing a hoicked-up caftan and prayer beads above his
shining riding boots".</p>
<p>In 1976 Crispin married her secrerary Ann Clements, three years
before his death. She had started to work for him in 1957, and soon
adopted the role of combined secretary and protector, who also went
shopping for him and acted as cook. By the early 1970s, Crispin's
drinking finally overwhelmed him and he became increasingly
semi-recluse. He was hospitalized as an emergency patient for weeks, he
needed assistance with changing clothes, and he was too weak to write.
Crispin also suffered from osteroporosis. In his final years he
attended services at Dartington Parish Church. "I am a Churchman," he
told <i>The Armchair Detectice</i>, "not very active one, but the fact
that I am one at all in these days is so odd and unexpected that I
thought it worth mentioning." Crispin died on September 15, 1978. <span style="font-style: italic;">Fen Country</span>, a  collection on short stories, came out posthumously in 1979. </p>

<p>Crispin was an early advocate of SF and presented it as a legitimate
form of writing without any excuses &#8211; an attitude that was not common
in the 1950s, when it was not yet respectable branch of literature. As
a science-fiction anthologist Crispin became thoroughly familiar with
the currents of the genre and he knew personally such writers as Brian
Aldiss and Harry Harryson, who once helped him home from a pub in
Totnes. When the <i>New Worlds </i>magazine suffered from financial
troubles in the late 1960s, it was bailed out by a Arts Council grant;
an appeal was supported by Crispin, Anthony Burgess, Angus Wilson, and
other eminent figures. </p>
