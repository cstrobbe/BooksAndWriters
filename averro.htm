<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Medieval Spanish-Arab philosopher,
physician, and jurist of the Shariah law, who reintroduced Aristotelian
thought to Western Europe. After Latin versions of Averroes'
commentaries on Aristotle started to circulate among scholars, the
works of the great Greek philosopher were rediscovered. Averroes tried
to unite Aristotle with religious thinking. He argued that the
teachings of Aristotle are not in conflict with the Holy Law. "He gave
to Aristotle the sort of reverence that is given to the founder of a
religion," said Bertand Russell in <span style="font-style: italic;">A History of Western Philosophy</span> (1946). In the West Averroes was a very important thinker, but in the Islamic 
world his rationalist theology had little influence until the nineteenth century.&nbsp; 





</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"For it is evident from more than one
verse in the Book of God Almighty that He calls upon men to believe in
the existence of the Originator, glory be to Him, through rational
arguments detailed specifically therein, such as the saying of the
Almighty: "O people, worship your Lord who has created you as well as
those who came before you"; and as the other saying of the Almighty:
"Is there any doubt about Allah, Maker of the heavens and the earth?"
in addition to many other verses in the same vein." </b>(in <i>Faith And Reason In Islam</i> by Averroes, translated by Ibrahim Najjar, Oneworld Publications Ltd, 2001) </font></blockquote>
<p>Abu al-Walid ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd, know in Europe as Averroes, was
born in Córdova, the capital of Muslim Spain, where he spent the most
of his life. He was a scion of a long line of religious judges and
statesmen in Andalusia. Following the traditions of his family,
Averroes was educated in Islamic law, but also in Hellenistic sciences
in their Arab form. Later he served as the religious judge (<i>qadi</i>) of Seville (1169-1172), and chief judge of Córdova (1172-1182). </p><p>The
turning point in Averroes' career came in 1169. His friend Ibn Tufayl,
a physician and the author of the philosophical allegory <i>Hayy Ibn Yaqzan</i>,
introduced him to the calip Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, who was genuinely
interested in philosophy. According to the historian al-Marakushi, the
caliph asked Averroes, "What do the philosophers believe regarding
heaven? Is it eternal or created in time?" Averroes feigned ignorance
of philosophy, but Ibn Tafayl recommended Averroes' talents as the
Commentator of Aristotle. Thus he was invited to write his famous
comments on the texts of the philosopher in their Arabic translations.
He often produced short, medium, and long commentaries on the same
work. The short commentaries&nbsp;he&nbsp;frequently peppered
with&nbsp;insights into contemporary&nbsp;issues. </p><p>"How wonderful is this man and how different is his nature from human natures generally," Averroes wrote on Aristotle in <i>Kitab al-Qiyas</i>.
"It is as though divine art brought him forth so as to inform us,
humans, that ultimate perfection is possible in the human species
perceptibly and demonstrably." However, it is probable that he was not
acquainted with Greek and based his views on Syriac and Arabic
translations. </p>
<p>In 1182 Averroes succeeded Ibn Tufayl as royal physician to caliph
at the court of Marrakesh. The caliph died a few years later. When his
son Abu Yusuf Ya'qub, nicknamed al-Mansur, succeeded his father,
Averroes continued to enjoy the royal patronage until 1195 when he was
tried as a heretic by the religious community of Córdova. According to
some sources, Averroes had referred al-Mansur in the <i>Book of Animals</i> as the "king of the Berbers" (<i>al-barbar</i>),
which could be read as Barbarians. Averroes was banished in disgrace
and many of his works were burned. After a period of exile, he was
restored to grace and the edicts against him were rescinded. Averroes
died in 1198 in Marrakesh, Morocco. With his death, Muslim philosophy
in Spain ended. <br>
 </p><p>Even during his lifetime Averroes' philosophy was considered
controversial, but he had a great impact on Western-European thought.
Also his compendium of medicine, <i>al-Kulliyat</i> (in Latin,
Colliget) was used for centuries. In Islamic lands, where orthodoxy and
al-Ghazali's intuitive and mystical sense of the Divine won, Averroes'
rationalism did not have following and&nbsp;he has remained a marginal
figure. Farah Antun's translation of <span class="st">Ernest Rénan's&nbsp;(1823-1892) historical essay<em>&nbsp;Averroès et l'Averroïsme</em> (1866, rev. ed., 1882) </span>revived
interest in him; Averroes was seen as the harbinger of an attempt to
modernize Islam. In his study of the life and philosophy of Averroes,
Antun&nbsp;represented him as a victim of religious persecution. &nbsp;</p><p>During
the Middle Ages, Islamic scholars preserved ancient Greco-Roman
learning. At the same time Western scholars had almost completely
forgotten Aristotle and the great cultural legacy of the Greeks. In
Islamic Spain there were numerous important libraries, and Christian
scholars travelled south to make use of these resources. Greek texts
had been translated into Arabic already after the Arab armies marched
into Syria and Iraq. Severus Sebokht, who died in 667, wrote
commentaries on the <i>Rhetorica </i>of Aristotle in the Monophysite
monastery of Qinnesrin in northern Syria. Also Athanasius of Balad (d.
696) and George, Bishop of the Arabs (d. 724) produced commentaries and
translations. Alexandria, the most important center for the study of
Greek philosophy in the seventh century, fell in 641. Spain was invaded
and overwhelmed by Muslim army in 710-712. With its palaces, mosques
and libraries, Córdova became the most brilliant city in Europe. </p>
<p>After Greek and Arabic texts began to be translated in great
numbers, the writings of the great Arabic philosophers, mostly
importantly <a href="avicenna.htm">Avicenna </a>(Ibn Sina, 980-1037)
and Averroes, became available. They also offered quite unfamiliar
ideas. When Averroes' works started to spread after 1230, they were
received with much enthusiasm and curiosity. Pope Gregory IX ordered a
commission to examine what measures could be taken to permit Christians
to study books that were not allowed to be taught. However, in the
1270s Siger of Brabant, Boethius of Dacia, and Bernier of Nivelles were
condemned for Averroistic heresies at Paris. <a href="../../../dante.htm">Dante </a>was accused of Averroism shortly after he died and his book, <i>De Monarchia</i>, was burned by the order of Pope John XXII. </p>
<p>From the thirteenth to mid-seventeenth centuries scholars regularly
read Aristotle with Averroes' commentaries. In Raphael's celebrated
fresco <i>The School of Athens</i> (1510-11) in the Stanza della
Segnatura in the Vatican, the figure of Averroes is found standing
behind Pythagoras and looking over his shoulder. And much later,
Averroes' life inspired the Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine's
film <i>Destiny </i>(1997), which warned of the dangers of fundamentalism. The Argentinian writer <a href="../../../jlborges.htm">Jorge Luis Borges</a> portaryed the scholar in 'Averroës' Search' (<i>The Aleph</i>,
1949) at work in his library, trying solve the enigma of the words
"tragedy" and "comedy". Eventually he writes that tragedy means
"panegyric," and that comedy means "satire." Too loyal to Islam, he
cannot break circle of his own culture. </p><p>One of Borges's sources was the French critic and historian Ernest Rénan, who argued in <i>Averroès et l'Averroïsme</i> (1852) that Averroes' paraphrase of the <i>Poetics </i>of
Aristotle evinces ignorance of Greek Literature. Borges takes up the
view: "Averroës's blunders in matters of Greek literature cannot but
make one smile. He imagines that tragedy is nothing more than the art
of encomium, comedy the art of censure; he then claims to find
tragedies and comedies in the Arabic panegyrics and satires, and even
in the Koran!" Borges's story is a postmodern fiction-about-fiction. At
the end Averroes vanishes, to give room to the voice of the author, who
explains that he tried to narrate the process of failure, but on the
last page he felt that "Averroës, trying to imagine what a play is
without ever having suspected what a theater is, was no more absurd
than I, trying to imagine Averröes yet with no more material than a few
snatches from Renan, Lane, and Asín Palacios." </p>
<p>Averroes' works include medical and astronomical writings,
commentaries, and judicial and conceptual defenses of philosophy. As a
physician he argued that the most important aspects of preserving
health are a good digestion and a sound bowel-movement. Fruits and
herbs should be avoided. Averroes became an authority among both Jews
and Christians, and his commentaries on Aristotle influenced such
theologians as Rabbi Moses ibn Maimon (1135-1204), St. Thomas Aquinas,
who quoted him five hundred and three times, and Albert the Great. Ibn
Maimon declared himself to be a disciple of a pupil of Ibn Bajja.
Averroes' commentaried he began to read in exile in Egypt. </p><p>Averroes
opposed the Ash'arite theologians, led by the great Muslim thinker Abu
Hamid al-Ghazali (1058-1111), whose onslaught on Greek-Arabic
philosophy is said to have signaled the death of philosophy in the
East. Al-Ghazali believed that it is impossible to proof the existence
of God rationally. As an answer to al-Ghazali's <i>Tahafut al-Falasifah</i> (Incoherence of the Philosophers) Averroes wrote <i>Tahafut al-Tahafur</i> (Incoherence of the Incoherence). He also criticized in it Ibn Sina's Neoplatonic metaphysics. In <i>Exposition of the Method of Proof </i>Averroes
dealt with the question of God's existence and proposed his own proofs.
The treatise was not translated into Latin but St. Thomas Aquinas'
(1225-1274) famous approach to the question in <i>The Summa Theologica</i> rely upon Aristotle in similar way. </p>

<p>"Every prophet is a philosopher, but not every philosopher is a
prophet", Averroes thought. Not everybody was capable of interpreting
Qur'anic texts &#8211; only the adept or "people of demonstration" are able
to undertake the interpretation of ambiguous passages in the<i> Qur'an</i>. But there are certain doctrines about God, which must be accepted <i>in toto</i>,
such as the existence of God as Creator and Sustainer of the world, the
creation of the world by God, the validity of prophecy, and the
resurrection of the body on the Last Day.</p><p>Averroes&nbsp;did not
see any real conflict between philosophy and religion, or philosophical
texts (Aristotle) and religious texts (<i>Qur'an</i>), "philosophy has
always existed among the adepts of revelation, i.e. the prophets, peace
be on them." Truth may be discovered by philosophers through logic, but
it may also be reveled figuratively, as it is in scriptures. "All that
is wanted in an enquiry into philosophical reasoning has already been
perfectly examined by the Ancients. All that is required of us is that
we should go back to their books and see what they have said in this
connection. If all that they say be true, we should accept it and if
there be something wrong, we should be warned by it. " <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">On the Harmony of Religions and Philosophy</font></i><font size="2">, in Arabic </font><i><font size="2">Kitab fasl al-maqal</font></i><font size="2">, see: </font><a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1190averroes.html"><font size="2">Medieval Sourcebook</font></a><font size="2"> )</font></p><p>In
the West, Averroes' support to&nbsp;the idea that there are different
paths to the truth,&nbsp;was misunderstood.&nbsp;His&nbsp;attempt to
harmonize religion and philosophy led to accusations of accepting the
doctrine of "double truth," that a thing can be true in philosophy or
according to reason while its opposite is true in theology or according
to faith.&nbsp;The strict Averroist Pietro Pomponazzi
(1462-1525)&nbsp;went even further and argued, that Averroes
proved&nbsp;that religious laws are neither true nor false, but
designed to lead people to salvation and happiness&nbsp;<font size="2">(<em>Averroes and his Philosophy</em> by Oliver Leaman, 1997, p. 171). </font></p><p>Diverging
from many Islamic thinkers, Averroes showed little ethusiasm for
mysticism.&nbsp;He believed that the intellect is universal and
immortal. The relationship between the Active Intellect and the
material intellect is what form is to matter; the Active Intellect is a
"power of in the soul" and common to all mankind and eternal. According
to Averroes, all generable and corruptible entities are made up of
matter and form; soul is the the form or first perfection of a natural
body. For these thoughts he was condemned for not believing in the
immortality of the individual soul. In popular myth he was regarded as
an atheist refuted by St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>
