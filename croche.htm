<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French writer, social critic, and
feminist, who examined in her novels the situation of women and
children, female sexuality, and struggle for personal freedom.
Rochefort gained international fame with <i>Le Repos du guerrier</i> (1958, Warrior's Rest), which was made into a film in 1962, starring Brigitte Bardot. <i>Les petits enfants du siècle</i>
(1961), another widely translated novel, was a&nbsp;commentary
on&nbsp;the French government-assistance epoch. Rochefort received Prix
du Roman Populiste in 1961 and the Medicis Prize in 1988. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Je suis née des Allocations et d'un joun
férié dont la matinée s'étirait, bienheureuse, au son de "Je t'aime tu
m'aimes", oué àla trompette douce. C'était le début de l'hiver, il
faisait bon dans le lit, vien ne pressait."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Les petits enfants du siécle</font></i><font size="2">, 1961) </font></blockquote>

<p>Christiane Rochefort was born in Paris, but the first years she
spent in the province of Limousin, before her family moved to Paris
where she lived all her life. During Rochefort's career as a writer,
little biographical information was published about her. She was the
only child of working-class parents. Her father worked as a telegraph
operator. </p><p>After attending the lycée Fénelon, she studied
medicine, psychology, and ethnology at Sorbonne, and worked later as a
model, actress, and newspaper correspondent
. In addition she tried her hand as an artist. Along with a number of
other French public figures, Rochefort signed the Manifesto of the 121
September 1960, formally called the "Déclaration sur le droit à
l'insoumission dans la guerre d'Algérie", the statement "respecting and
judging justified the refusal to take up arms against the Algerian
people." </p><p>At the Cinémathètique Française, Rochefort cooperated with
Henri Langlois, the legendary film archivist. Langlois' concept of film
archiving clashed with professionalism of the Cinémathètique and André
Malraux, who was the Minister of Culture, tried to impose a new
administrator in 1968. Langlois started with his staff and film
personalities a counter attack, which they won. At Cannes film festival
Rochefort worked as a press secretary for 15 years, but was dismissed
in 1968 from her post at Cannes for her "freedom of thought". In the
same year the festivals were closed by the events of May 1968; François
Truffaut and other prominent directors rallied to stop screenings in
support of striking students and workers. </p>

<p>However, writing was Rochefort's calling; she published nine novels,
though the Julliard Publishing House rejected the first manuscripts of
Rochefort and Marguerite Duras, too,&nbsp;because they were too
intellectual. Her first book, <i>Cendres et Or</i>, came out in
1956.&nbsp;At that time she was over 40. Rochefort had divorced after a
marriage of four years &#8211; accroding to some sources because she though
that a marriage restricts a woman and her creativity. Rochefort said in
an interview that her husband forced her to choose between being
married and being a writer; she choose to be a free woman. In 1971,
with other activists, she lay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier in the name of "the one more unknown than the unknown soldier,
his wife." </p>
<p><i>Warrior's Rest</i>, published in 1958, just missed receiving the
Prix Fémina &#8211; after a battle between women jurors, the prize went to
Café Céleste of Françoise Mallet-Jorris. Also the Académie Goncourt
squabbled over Rochefort's work, but it won a newly created award, the
Prix de la nouvelle vague (Prize of the New Wave). The book was a huge
success, sold 600,000 copies, and broke the conventional view that it
is impossible for a woman to depict male erotic fantasies. </p><p><i>Warrior's Rest</i>
is an anarchistic and sadomasochistic story, based partly on Orpheus
and Eurydice. It concerns Geneviève Le Theil, a young Parisienne, and
Jean-Renaud Sarti. Renaud is an alcoholic former soldier, he has lost
his hope after the bombing of Hiroshima. Ten years later he tries to
kill himself in a small-city hotel. Geneviève finds him accidentally,
saves his life and becomes Renaud's lover, having with him her first
orgasms. Renaud is violent, he beats her and separates her from her
family and friends. They travel to Switzerland and Italy. She is going
to have a child by him and Renaud wants to marry her. He insist on
trying to rehabilitate himself by going to the clinic he calls the
Great Washing Machine. Rochefort herself identified with Renaud, the
male antihero, not with Geneviève or Rafaële, to whom Geneviève is
attracted. </p><p>The story was 
adapted into screen in 1962 under the title <i>Love on a Pillow</i>
and directed by Roger Vadim, starring Vadim's ex-wife Brigitte Bardot
in their fourth film. In the comedy Bardot bestows her pleasures on
young man, hoping to divert his intended suicide. During the filming
Bardot announced that she intends to retire from the screen. A stage
version from 1961, starring Ralf Vallone, was a flop.&nbsp; Marlene
Dietrich, who had an affair with Vallone, was under consideration for
the role of Geneviève&nbsp;that went to Françoise Prévost.&nbsp;
Vallone had adapted the novel for the stage, too. </p>

<p><i>Les Petits enfants du Siècle</i> (Children of Heaven) received
the Prix du Roman Populiste (the Populist Prize). Rochefort's second
novel satirized the French government's post-war policy of providing
family allowances in order to increase the national birth-rate. The
story started with the words "I was born of the family subsidies..."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font>Rochefort
focused on a working-class family living in a huge project on the
outskirts of Paris. Philippe is a television-installation man. Josyane
Rouvier, the narrator, is a tough working-class girl. She has grown up
in a housing project and has gone through an adolescent sex affair with
an elder man. She becomes pregnant by a nice young man, Philippe, whom
she genuinely loves, but plans to produce children in order to acquire
consumer goods. </p><p>Rochefort's view is pessimistic: the novel ends
with Josyane succumbing to romantic love and continuing the cycle of
child production, following the fate of her mother. "Whether or not one
agrees with Miss Rochefort's black-and-white view of the Benevolent
State, her talent is unarguable," wrote the <i>Village Voice </i>(September 6, 1962). "In "Children of Heaven" there is bite and sharp satire, and <font face="Symbol">- </font><font face="Symbol"></font>as M. Rouvier would say about his second-hand Citroen <font face="Symbol">-</font><font face="Symbol"></font> it holds the road well." </p>

<p>Rochefort's novels were often simultaneously ironic and confessional. The first-person narrator of <em>La porte du fond</em> (1988)&nbsp;makes part of her life "to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;pain in the arse to as many people as possible."&nbsp;Rochefort
 depicted the struggles of social outcasts and sexual minorities, and contrasted conventional language 
and attitudes with innovative use of slang and colloquialisms. 
Central themes <font face="Symbol">-</font><font face="Symbol"></font> in the spirit of sexually free 1960s 
<font face="Symbol">-</font> were repression of female sexuality and creativity in 
contemporary society. Lesbian relationships represent a potential challenge to patriarchal norms and the nuclear family. </p><p>

<i>Les stances à Sophie</i> (1963, Cat's Don't Care for Money) borrowed
its storyline from an obscene medical students' song and followed it
from a female point of view. Céline, the narrator, leaves his old way
of life after meeting her husband's best friend's wife Julia and enters
into a lesbian relationship with her. Rochefort suggests that marriage
is&nbsp;little more than an institutionalized form of&nbsp;(unpaid)
prostitution.&nbsp;"The novel is mostly a criticism of middle-class,
upwardly mobile male attitudes, ego, competitiveness, and
insensitivity" said Jennifer R. Waelti-Walters (<font size="2"><i>Damned women: Lesbians in French Novels, 1796-1996</i>, 
2000, pp. 122-123)</font>.&nbsp; 

<i>Les stances à Sophie</i>, which has been filmed twice, became very popular in France. 
</p>

<p>Rochefort's first fantasy book, <i>Une rose pour Morrison </i>(1966), was written 
in twenty-four days, in a state of trance. This work 
more experimental in its style than her earlier novels. <i>Archaos ou le Jardin étincelant</i> (1972) was an utopian fantasy, 
which explored the theme of female power. Achaos, a lost kingdom, is a threat to its neighbours because 
it allows sexual freedom to its women.<font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>Besides novels, Rochefort published short stories and essays, appeared in Bernard Pivot's legendary television program,<i> Apostrophes</i>, 
and translated into French writings by her partner, the Israeli artist, columnist, playwrigt and novelist Amos Kenan. 
She also translated John Lennon's <i>En flagrant délire</i> (In His Own Write) with Rachel Misrahi. <i>Ma Vie revue et corrigée par l'auteur</i> (1978) was Rochefort's account of her own life. In <i>Les enfants d'abord </i>(1976), a collection of essays, 
she saw children as the oppressed class. The theme continued in
last work, <em>La Porte du fond</em>, a story&nbsp;of incest. The book 
received Prix Médicis award, and was translated into several languages, including 
Finnish. Written in confessional style, the writer approached her subject from the 
feminist point of view. Rochefort died on April 24, 1998. </p>
