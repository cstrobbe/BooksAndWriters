      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Anglo-Irish novelist,
playwright,
best known for&nbsp; the tetralogy <em>The Alexandria Quartet </em>(1957-60).
Many once believed it would secure Durrell the Nobel Prize for
Literature. The experimental novel of mystery, love, and espionage
explored memory and knowledge, contrasting in its story the love affair
of a young writer with the recollections of the other people. Durrell
spent most of his life outside England &#8211; in India, Corfu, Egypt,
Yugoslavia, Rhodes, Cyprus, and the south of France. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Hellenic worlds are replaced here
by something different, something subtly androgynous, inverted upon
itself. The Orient cannot rejoice in the sweet anarchy of the body &#8211;
for it has outstripped the body. I remember&nbsp;Nessim once
saying&nbsp;&#8211; I think he was quoting&nbsp;&#8211; that Alexandria was the
great winepress of love; those who emerged from it were the sick men,
the solitaries, the prophets &#8211; I mean all who have been deeply wounded
in their sex." </b>(from <em>Justine</em>,&nbsp;volume&nbsp;one of
the </font><i><font size="2">Alexandria Quartet</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Lawrence Durrell was born in Darjeeling, India, the son of
Lawrence Samuel Durrell, a British civil engineer, and Louisa (Dixie)
Durrell, who was of pure Protestant Irish descent. Both his parents had
been born and brought up in the India of the Raj. "God-fearing, lusty,
chapel-going Mutiny stock," Durrell later described his family's Indian
roots. At the age of twelve Durrell was taken to England. Durrell had
little feeling for England and the English &#8211; when his mother had
applied for a British passport, she declared: "I am a citizen of
India." He attended numerous schools from 1923 to 1928 without much
success, and worked for some time as a jazz pianist in a London
nightclub. In the 1930s he went to Paris, where he started his career
as a writer and associated with such authors as <a href="hmiller.htm">Henry
Miller</a>, who became his mentor. The two kept up an exchange of
letters over 45 years. </p>
      <p>In 1935 Durrell moved with his mother to the island of Corfu &#8211;
several of his works were later connected to Mediterranean countries.
His brother Gerald Durrell described life there in his book <i>My
Family and Other Animals </i>(1956). Between the years 1934 and 1940
he edited a little magazine called <i>Booster</i> (later <i>Delta</i>).
Durrell's first novel of interest,<em> The Black Book: An Agon</em>,
heavily influenced by Miller, was published in Paris in 1938. The
mildly pornographic fantasia did not appear in Britain until 1973. In
the story Lawrence Lucifer struggles to escape the spiritual sterility
of dying England, and finds Greece's warmth and fertility. </p>
      <p>During WW II Durrell served as a press attaché to the British
embassies in Cairo and Alexandria from 1941 to 1944.&nbsp;Durrell
disliked Alexandria and he left the city&nbsp;for good in May 1945,
taking with him his a "quarry" book, in which he wrote his first notes
for an Alexandria novel. After the war he held various diplomatic and
teaching jobs. He worked in Rhodos, Belgrad, finally settling in Cyprus
in 1953. From 1947 to 1948 he was a director of the British Council
Institute in Argentina. Durrell's observation of the diplomatic life at
the British legation in Belgrade, where he was from 1949 to 1952, gave
him material for <em>White Eagles Over&nbsp;Serbia</em> (1957), which
gained considerable success. In the story Colonel Methuen of Special
Operations Q Branch is called to the office of his commanding officer
and asked: "How far would it be if one walked from Belgrade to
Salonika? Methuen starts his perilous mission which takes him deep into
the mountains of Yugoslavia. Durrell's description of the highlands of
the country forms an intrinsic part of the novel. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The woods were carpeted with
flowers, sweet-smelling salvia, cranesbill, and a variety of ferns.
Here and there, too, bright dots of scarlet showed him where the wild
strawberries grew, and in these verdant woods the pines and beeches
increased in size until he calculated that he was walking among glades
of trees nearly a hundred feet in height. He could not help contrasting
all this place and beauty with the grim errand upon which he was bent,
and which might lead to him to sudden death."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">White Eagles over Serbia</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1953 Durrell left diplomatic service and moved to Cyprus,
but from 1954 to 1956 he returned to it, on account of the Cypriot
revolution, as director of Public Relations for the British Government.
He finally settled in Provence, France, where he lived for the rest of
his life. Among his later works are <em>Justine</em> (1957), in which
Justine's emotional and sexual wildness fuels a highly-charged
atmosphere, <em>Balthazar</em> (1958), <em>Mountolive</em> (1959) and
      <em>Clea</em> (1960), forming together the <i>Alexandria Quartet</i>,
entitled 'The Book of the Dead.' All four parts in the work climax in
death. The&nbsp;metropolis serves as the&nbsp;basis in&nbsp;the
exploration of human existence. </p>
      <p>Set in Alexandria during the period just before World War II,
the first three novels cover roughly the same period of time and the
events, while <i>Clea</i> advances the action in time. In the early
decades of the twentieth century, Alexandria was known as a "Little
Paris." Principal characters include the narrator L.G. Darley, his
Greek mistress Melissa, the British ambassador Mountolive, the British
intelligence agent Pursewarden, Durrell's spokesman for artistic
vision, although his ambiguous death occurs already in <i>Justine</i>,
the artist Clea, and Justine and her wealthy Coptic husband Nessim. All
are bound together in a web of political and sexual intrigue: each
novel reveals different aspect of the truth. Darley's point of view
from Justine is contradicted by others in <i>Balthazar</i>; <i>Mountolive</i>
gives the facts, and <i>Clea</i> tells of the writer's journey of self
discovery. Conventional distinctions &#8211; major/minor characters, main
plots/subplots &#8211; are denied. Numerous characters disappear, then
re-emerge in altered form. It has been said that in <i>Alexandria
Quartet</i> Durrell reinvented the modern novel. The ancient city
itself is the fifth character&nbsp;&#8211; city of knowledge, books, and
stories, at the same time real and half-imagined. (<b><font size="2">Other
writers who have depicted
Alexandria:</font></b> <a href="kafavis.htm"><font size="2">Constantine
Cavafy</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="mahfouz.htm"><font size="2">Naguib
Mahfouz</font></a><font size="2">, Edward el-Kharrat, <a href="forster.htm">E.M. Forster</a>)</font> </p>
      <p>In general, the&nbsp;<em>Quartet</em> gained critical acclaim.
Although the Egyptian author Mahmoud Manzaloui acknowledged
Durrell's power in "setpieces, landscapes, and townscapes," he gave a
lenghty list of Durrell's errors about Egyptian culture and the Arabic
languege.&nbsp;The movie based upon the story was a flop. Durrell
sought to replicate his success with <i>The Avignon Quintet</i>: <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Monsieur: or, The Prince of Darkness</em><strong>
      </strong></span></span>(1974),&nbsp; <em>Livia: or, Buried Alive
      </em>(1978), <span class="st"><em>Constance, or, Solitary
Practices</em><strong> </strong></span>(1982); <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Sebastian,
or, Ruling Passions</em> </span></span>(1983). Although the works had
much in common, <i>The Avignon Quintet</i> did not commercially outdo
its predecessor. Again the theme is an invard journey, but now West and
East come together in a spiritual alliance. "We must learn from such
doctor-mystics as Groddeck to treat the whole of reality as a
symptom!... the two metaphysics, Eastern and Western, are moving
steadily together and given time will meet in many essential fields." <font size="-1">(Durrell, in Margaret McCall, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lonely Roads</span>: Notes for an
Unwritten Book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Twentieth Century
Literature</span>, Vol. 33, No. 3, Autumn, 1987)</font> <br>
      </p>
      <p>Durrell was married four times, in 1935 with Nancy Meyers
(divorced in 1947), and then with Yvette Cohen. His third marriage, in
1961 to a Frenchwoman, Claude, ended with her death in 1967. In 1973 he
married Ghislaine de Boysson (divorced in 1979). He had two daughters
by each of his first two marriages. His second daughter, Sappho,
committed suicide in 1985, leaving behind writings that pointed
accusingly at her father &#8211; probably without basis. Durrell died of a
stroke at his home in Sommières, on November 7, 1990, following a
lengthy struggle with emphysema. He was nominated as a candidate for
the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1961, when Ivo Andric
received&nbsp;the honor,&nbsp;the jury passed his name, because of his
"monomanical preoccupation with erotic complications." Durrell also
produced several travel books describing
the places he had visited. Other publications include humorous short
stories, plays in verse, and poems. Durrell's&nbsp; brother Gerald
Durrell (<b>see below)</b>, zoologist
and traveller, gained popularity with his animal stories.</p>

Durrell&nbsp; (1925-1995):&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2"> British
zoologist,
traveller, writer, and broadcaster, brother of the author Lawrence
Durrell</font><font size="2">. Gerald Durrell was born in Jamshedpur,
India, the fourth
surviving child of Louisa Florence Durrell and Lawrence Samuel Durrell.
When he was ten, his widowed mother took her family to live on the
Greek island of Corfu, where Durrell was educated by private tutors.
From 1945 to 46 he worked at Whipsnade Zoo and then went on several
animal collecting expeditions to Cameroon, Guyana, and other countries.
In the 1950s Durrell published his first animal stories, which became
very popular and&nbsp;were translated into many languages. <i>My
Family and Other Animals</i> (1956) told tales about his unconventional
family and the islanders on Corfu. In <i>The Drunken Forest</i> (1978)
and <i>Three Tickets to Adventure</i> (1954) Durrell described
animal-collecting expeditions. With his second wife Lee, a
conservationist, Durrell bred rare species for eventual return to the
wild. In 1958 Durrell founded the Jersey Zoological Park. He was also
founder chairman of Wildlife Preservation Trust International in 1972.
Durrell died on January 30, 1995.</font><b><font size="2"> Selected
