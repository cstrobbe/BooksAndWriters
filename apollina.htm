<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Poet who took part in all avant-garde
movements in French literature at the beginning of the 20th century.
Besides writing poetry, Apollinaire published semi-pornographical
books; he was an innovator in the theatre of the absurd, and made known
Cubism as a school of painting with his study <span style="font-style: italic;">Les peintres cubistes</span> (1913).
During the World War I Apollinaire enlisted and fought on the front. In
a letter he described war as a "beautiful thing" and continued: "...
despite all the risks I run, the exhaustion, the total lack of water,
of everything, I am not unhappy to be here..."</p>
      <blockquote>
        <font size="2">"<b>Although he lived his days among the </b></font><b><i><font size="2">baladins </font></i><font size="2">of Cubism and Futurism,
he was not a modern man. He was somewhat less complex and more happy,
more ancient, and stronger. (He was so unmodern that modernity seemed
picturesque, and perhaps even moving, to him.) He was the "winged and
sacred thing" of Platonic dialogue; he was a man of elemental and,
therefore, eternal feelings; he was, when the fundaments of earth and
sky shook, the poet of ancient courage and ancient honor." </font></b><font size="2">(Jorge Luis Borges in </font><i><font size="2">The Total
Library</font></i><font size="2">, 1999) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Guillaume
Apollinaris de Kostrowitzky kept his origin secret,
but he was probably born in Rome, the illegitimate son of a Polish
adventurer called Angelica de Kostrowitzky, a rebellious Polish girl.
Her father had been a colonel in the Papal guard. Apollinaire's father
was possibly a Swiss-Italian aristocrat, Francesco Flugi
d'Aspermont. He disappeared early from Apollinaire's life, and the
future poet was raised by his gambling mother in Italy, in Monaco, on
the French Riviera, and in Paris. <br>
</p>
      <p>Living apart from his mother with his brother Albert in complete freedom, Apollinaire assumed in his youth
the
identity of a Russian prince. He received a French education at the
Collège Saint-Charles in Monaco, and afterwards in schools in Cannes
and Nice. Employed as a tutor for the daughter of a German viscountess,
Apollinaire traveled widely in Europe. During the summer of 1899 he
went to the Ardennes region
of Belgium. </p>

      <p>At the age of 20 Apollinaire settled in Paris, where he worked
for a time for a bank. He contibuted to such periodicals as <i>La
Revue blanche</i>, <i>La Plume</i>, and <i>Le Mercure de France</i>.
In 1903 he founded his own magazine, <i>Le Festin d'Esope</i>, and the
short-lived <i>La Revue immoraliste</i>. Among his friends were such
artist as Pablo Picasso, André Derain, playwright <a href="ajarry.htm">Alfred
Jarry</a>, and the painter Marie Laurencin, who was his lover. At the
age of twenty-one he traveled in Germany. In 1901-02 he worked as a
tutor in the Rhineland. Although Apollinaire wrote poetry, as a member
of <i>la bande à Picasso</i> he was more known in the following years
as the advocate of modern painting. He brought Picasso and Braque
together, and helped organize the cubist room 41 at the Salon des
Indépendants in 1911. </p>
      <p>Apollinaire also edited a number of reviews, published
satirical and semi-pornographical texts, and proclaimed that the
writing of <a href="desade.htm">de Sade</a> would dominate the
20th-century. His first prose work, <span style="font-style: italic;">L&#8217;Enchanteur pourrissant</span> (1909),
was illustrated with woodcuts by André Derain. The prose-poem depicted
the entombment of Merlin the Enchanter. His grave is visited by a
number of figures from mythology, folklore and history. They have been
interpreted as Merlin's alter egos. From his love for Viviane, the Lady
of the Lake, Merlin creates a new vision of men and women. </p>
      <p>With the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alcools</span> (1913) Apollinaire was
recognized as a highly original voice in contemporary poetry. <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Bestiaire ou Cortège d'Orphée</span> (1911), initially illustrated by Raoul Dufy's woodcuts, was
later set to music by Francis Poulenc. <i>Alcools</i> was a selection
of poems written over the previous 15 years. It combined classical
verse forms with modern imagery, involving transcriptions of street
conversations overheard by change and the absence of punctuation. It
opened with the poem 'Zone', in which the tormented poet wanders
through streets after the loss of his mistress. Among its other famous
lyrical pieces is 'Le pont Mirabeau.' Some of its poems were inspired
by Jacqueline Kolb. Annie Playden, an English governess, inspired the
Rhineland piece, 'La chanson du mal-aime.' </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>A la fin tu es las de ce monde
ancien </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">
Bergère ô tour Eiffel le troupeau des ponts bêle ce matin </font><br>
        <font size="2">
Tu en as assez de vivre dans l'antiquité grecque et romaine </font><br>
        <font size="2">
Ici même les automobiles ont l'air d'être anciennes </font><br>
        <font size="2">
La religion seule est restée toute neuve la religion </font><br>
        <font size="2">
Est restée simple comme les hangars de Port-Avion... </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Zone') </font></blockquote>
      <p>When cubism had become a powerful force, Apollinaire published
      <i>The Cubist Painters</i>, which explored the theory of cubism
and
analyzed psychologically the chief cubists and their works. According
to Apollinaire, art is not a mirror held up to nature, so cubism is
basically conceptual rather than perceptual. By means of the mind, one
can
know the essential transcendental reality that subsists "beyond the
scope of nature." Ten days after the appearance of the book,
Apollinaire
deserted cubism for Orphism. The concept was also invented by him and
described "the art of painting new structures out of elements that have
not been borrowed from the visual sphere but have been created entirely
by the artist himself, and have been endowed by him with the fullness
of reality." Among Orphicist artist were Robert Delaunay, Fernand
Léger, Francis Picabia, and Frantisek Kupka. The Surrealist painter
Giorgio de Chirico made in 1914 two paintings in tribute to
Apollinaire. In <i>Portrait of Apollinaire as a Premonition</i> the
poet uses sunglasses <font face="Symbol">-</font> he is blind. His neckties Apollinaire kept in a bottle; Picabia, using China ink, painted a tie on Apollinaire's shirt-front<br>
 </p>
      <p>In 1914 Apollinaire had a short-lived affair with Louise de
Coligny, then with a schoolteacher called Madeleine Pagès, to whom he
became engaged. Then he met Jacqueline Kolb, whom he married in 1918.
Disenchanted with his reputation as a dangerous foreigner and thief <font face="Symbol">-</font> in 1911 he had been detained for a week on
suspicion of stealing Leonardo's <i>Mona Lisa</i> from the Louvre
museum in Paris <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he took out French
nationality and enlisted in the infantry. (Apollinaire was not one of
the thieves, but a casual friend of his had stolen some statuettes from
the Louvre. Though he was famous for his erratic conduct, the publicity
he gained from this episode was entirely repugnant to him.)</p>
      <p>Apollinaire fought on the front in Champagne until 1916, when he received a head
wound while reading a new issue of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercure de France</span>.
Some of his poems Apollinaire wrote in the trench under fire:
"The sky is starry with Boche shells / The marvelous forest where I
live is giving a ball." Apollinaire's medical treatment included two
operations on his skull. Unfit for active service, Apollinaire took a
job in the Bureau of Censorship. <br>
      </p>
      <p>During and after his convalescence in Paris Apollinaire
continued to arrange new exhibitions and staged his one play <i>The
Breasts of Tiresias</i> in 1917, about a housewife, Therèse, who
changes sex and lets her breasts floating upwards as toy balloons.
Apollinaire called the play "Drame surréaliste," making the term known.
"I have coined the adjective 'surrealist' which does not mean
symbolical . . . but rather well defines a tendency of art, if it is no
newer than anything else under the sun, has at least never been
utilized to form an artistic or literary creed." In this successor of
Alfred Jarry's <i>Ubu Roi </i>Apollinaire combined
his own sexual obsessions with a satirical exploitation of Greek
legend and ironic preoccupation with the low birth rate in 19c-20c
France. </p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Le Poète assassiné</span> (1916, The Poet Assassinated) was a collage
of the great fictional poet Croniamantal from his birth to his
breakthrough as a poet and death at the hand of a mob. Apollinaire
composed the work from pieces which he had saved for years. Its a
broken, episodic narrative changes from farcical to exalted: "Others
profited from the intermission by vomiting wildly, their eyes bulging
out of their heads; their neighbours encouraged them with an
imperturbable seriousness. Hannes Irlbeck, who had gotten back on his
feet, but not without great effort, sniffed and murmured. 'There's no
more beer in Munich.'"  </p>
      <p>Apollinaire died of influenza in the great epidemic of 1918,
on November 9, in Paris, in his apartment on the Boulevard
Saint-Germain. Experimental <span style="font-style: italic;">Calligrammes</span> (1918), Apollinaire's poetic
record of his war experiences, came out a few months before his
death. André Breton, Tristan Tzara, Paul Éluard, and Louis Aragon and
other poets of the younger generation took up its call to investigate
new worlds of expression. Cubism left its marks on several literary
works and authors. Max Jacon, André Salmon, Pierre Reverdy, and
Gertrude Stein were intimately connected with the cubist painters. In
prose, critics have seen cubist aesthetics in André Gide's novel <i>Les
Fauxmonnayeurs</i> (1925). Apollinaire's stature has continued to grow
since his death, as the precursor of surrealism and as a modernist
poet. <i>The Breasts of Tiresias </i>was made into an opera (1947) by
Francis Poulenc. </p>
