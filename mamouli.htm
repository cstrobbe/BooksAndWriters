<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Russian-born film and stage director, who
had a successful series of shows on Broadway before entering Hollywood.
Mamoulian made 16 films in the 29 years of his cinema career. He was
among the liberators of cinema who created his unique rhythm and poetic
stylization by blending sound, visuals and camera movement with montage
effects. In 1982 Mamoulian received the Directors Guild of America D.W.
Griffith Award for a lifetime of outstanding contributions to motion
pictures. His most famous films include <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde</i>
(1932), starring Fredric March, and <i>Queen Christina</i> (1933),
starring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What I feel strongly is that the
artist &#8211; and I broaden this &#8211; the great majority of artists in every field are
betraying mankind. To me, the hope of the future is in the arts. It's
not in politics. It's not in economics. It's not in religion. It's not
in the arts. Because the arts are the only truly universal medium. The
whole thing should serve to remind you that man still has a potential,
that he's not just crawling on earth. He still has wings and he can
fly. We need this reminder of faith, of optimism, to reestablish the
dignity of a human being."</b> (Mamoulian in </font><font size="2"><i>Directing
the Film</i> by Eric Sherman, 1976)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Rouben Mamoulian was born in Tiflis (now Tbilisi), Georgia, of
Armenian descent. His father was a bank president. Mamoulian spent part
of his childhood in Paris and was trained under Eugene Vakhtangov and
Konstantin Stanislavsky at the Moscow Art Theatre. In 1918 Mamoulian
organized his own drama studio in Tiflis and two years later he toured
in England. He studied drama at the University of London and directed
there in 1922 his first play. </p>
      <p>In 1923 he moved to America and directed for three years
operas and operettas at the George Eastman School of Music in
Rochester, N.Y. Martha Graham and the Swedish modern dancer Ronny
Gustafson were hired to stage expressionistic dances for his operas. In
1926 he began teaching and produced many notable plays for New York's
Theatre Guild, including DuBose Heyward's <i>Porgy</i> (1927). The
Austrian director Max Reinhardt declared the production was one of his
"great experiences in the theatre." Mamoulian later directed the
premiere of George Gershwin's operatic version of the play, <i>Porgy
and Bess</i> (1935). </p>
      <p>As a result of his growing reputation in the theatre world,
Mamoulian was offered a seven-year contract in the Hollywood film
business. However, Mamoulian answered that he signs only short
contracts without options. After five weeks studying the mechanics of
motion picture making, he was ready to direct. His first talking films
for Paramount Pictures were acclaimed among the most innovative sound
productions of the day. <i>Applause </i>(1929) was Mamoulian's first
step to free camera and soundtrack from the constraints of the early
days' techology. Mamoulian put his camera booth on wheels in order to
move it about. He also used two cameras to increase the number of
possible angels. <br>
</p>
      <p>Mamoulian's other directions from this experimental period
include the horror classic <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde</i>
(1932), which used subjective camera, special camera filters, and
synthetic sounds. Jekyll's arrival at the medical theater is a long,
uncut take, seen from his point of view from his house to the
university. "I do believe the cinema is in imagery, not in words,"
Mamoulian once said. Fredric March won an Academy Award for his
performance as the kindly doctor and evil Hyde. The film is considered
the best adaptation of <a href="rlsteven.htm">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s
novella. However, Stevenson's work contained no mention of a pipe
organ, but Mamoulian opened his screen version with Dr. Jekyll playing
one in his home. The organ piece, Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,
possibly chosen by the dírector himself,&nbsp; has become infamous for
its overuse in horror films. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier musical <i>Love Me
Tonight</i> (1932) had big, densely-populated musical set-pieces. Every
member of the cast sang. The opening sequence is famous for its
innovative use of sound design: a rhytmic melody grows from the streets of
awakening Paris, the heartbeat of the city. Mamoulian's gangster melodrama <i>City Streets </i>(1931),
starring Sylvia Sidney, Gary Cooper, and Paul Lukas, was based on
Ernest Booth's story <i>Ladies of the Mob</i>.
Dashiell Hammett, who was at the height of his literary career and had
been signed to create original stories for the screen, co-wrote the
script. </p>

      <p><i>Queen Christina</i> (1933) was a <i>tour de force</i> for
Greta Garbo, although Mamoulian had thought a few years earlier that
she was not ready for the big part in Ivan Turgenev's <i>A Month In
The Country</i>,
a Theatre Guild production which opened in 1930. "There's a certain
luminosity about her freckled face," he said. The film includes one of
the most famous moments in Garbo's career. She glides around an inn
room, in which she has slept with her lover, memorizing every moment
for posterity. Mamoulian's advice for his star was, "I want your face
to be a blank sheet of paper. I want the writing to be done by every
member of the audience." The camera proceed from a long-shot to a
final, extended close-up of the actress's unmoving face. In the final
scene she stands in the prow of the ship, the wind blowing her hair.
Louis B. Mayer (1885-1957), the general manager of MGM, wanted a happy
ending. Laurence Olivier was hired for the male lead, but Garbo had him
booted off the production in favour of John Gilbert. The censors kept a
close eye on the script due to Queen Christina's supposedly bisexual
tendencies. The film did poorly in America, but was popular in Europe. <i>
Becky Sharp</i> (1935), based on <a href="wmthacke.htm">Thackeray'</a>s
classic novel <i>Vanity Fair</i>, was noted as the first feature in
three-color Technicolor. It won the color prize at the third Venice
Film Festival. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Director Rouben Mamoulian, who
took over
when Lowell Shwrman died, did a remarkable job with color
experimentation. He decided to use color thematically to express
character mood, and added more and more color as the film progresses
and the plot thickens. Every shot looks color-coordinated. The most
famous sequence in the panicky exit of the quests at the Duchess of
Richmond's gala in Belgium on the eve of the battle of Waterloo -
rather than having all the red-jacketed soldiers in attendance exit
first (as would be the case), Mamoulian had guests leave according to
their color group so only the one in red remained in the ballroom." </b></font><font size="2">(Danny Peary
in </font><i><font size="2">Guide for the Film Fanatic</font></i><font size="2">, 1986) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In <i>The Mark of Zorro</i> (1940) Mamoulian combined elemets
from Robin Hood and <a href="orczy.htm">The Scarlet Pimpernel.</a>
Tyrone Power played the role of the foppish Don Diego, who actually is
Señor Zorro, a mysterious vigilante and swordsman. He leads his
caballeros and peasants against the tyrannical Don Luis Quintero and
Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). Power's duel with Rathbone
is the highlight of the cat and mouse game. <i>Blood and Sand </i>(1941)
was based on the novel by Vicente Blasco Ibanez. It had been filmed in
1922, starring Rudolph Valentino. In the new version Tyrone Power
played the great but naive matador, Juan. Linda Danell was his devoted
sweetheart and wife and Rita Hayworth a temptress, Dona Sol. "Was it
Oscar Wilde who said, 'The sphinx is an enigma which has no solution.'
That's Rita. Casting her was a hunch, something I felt rather than saw.
I've always been strong on my impressions of people, usually first
impressions. Nobody else could have played it, because you couldn't <i>play</i>
Dona Sol, you had to be it. Garbo is the only other woman who could
have done it... The rarest thing on stage or screen is a beautiful
walk. On the screen there is Greta Garbo, Katherine Hepburn, Cyd
Charisse and Rita Hayworth, and after that... period."<font size="2">
(Mamoulian in </font><i><font size="2">Rita Hayworth</font></i><font size="2"> by John Kobal, 1978)</font>
Mamoulian's film pulsed again with color and had references to works of
such Spanish painters as El Greco and Goya. Mamoulian considered red
the most exciting color. "A progression of color should lead to a
climax, which can only be red," he has argued. "Not blue, not yellow,
red." </p>
      <p>Mamoulian periodically returned to the Broadway stage when his
ideas clashed with the Hollywood studio hierarchy. A unique stylist, he
was the right choice to direct <i>Laura</i> (1944), based on Vera
Caspary's novel, but after a few days' shooting he was replaced by Otto
Preminger, a comparative newcomer to Hollywood. The portrait of Laura,
a target of obsession in the film, was first painted by Azadia Newman,
but Preminger scrapped it with the rest of the set and used a
photograph by Frank Polony, smeared with oil paint. According to Gene
Tierney, who played Laura in the title role, "I am not being modest
when I say that people remember me less for my acting job than as the
girl in the portrait, which was the movie's key prop." </p>
      <p>Azadia Newman (1902-99) and Mamoulian married in 1945; they
met at a party at Tierney's home. Their marriage lasted until
Mamoulian's death.
Mamoulian also developed an interest in portraiture and made collage
pictures of his lynx-eyed wife out of stamps, maps, shells, leaves and
flowers.
By the late 1950s his poetic visions received little understanding. " I
feel that any subject &#8211; it doesn't have to be a fantasy &#8211; any subject
should be approached from a poetical point of view, and therefore
stylized," Mamoulian argued. He lost in 1958 assignment of directing
the film version of <i>Porgy and Bess</i>, and he was also fired from
the set of <i>Cleopatra</i>, because he wanted to shoot in Rome and
the studio opted for London. Both films turned out to be critical and
commercial failures. When Mamoulian abandoned <i>Cleopatra,</i> $7
million had been spent, and Mankiewicz took over. Mamoulian lived his
last years a forgotten man in a Beverly Hills mansion, filled with cats
and old furniture. </p>
      <p>For the theatre Mamoulian directed the premiers of such
landmark productions as <i>Oklahoma </i>(1943), <i>Carousel</i>
(1945), and <i>Lost in the Stars</i> (1949). Among his later films
were <i>Summer Holiday </i>(1948), a musical version of <a href="oneill.htm">Eugene O'Neill</a>'s <i>Ah, Wilderness!</i> and <i>Silk
Stockings</i>, (1957), a remake of <i>Ninotchka</i>, starring Fred
Astaire and Cyd Charisse. In this musical
comedy an icy female Soviet official is sent to the West where she is
melted by romance. Astaire did a rock 'n' roll number which both he and
Cole Porter, the composer, loathed. <i>Ninotchka</i> and <i>Silk
Stockings</i> were forbidden in Finland because of their jokes about
the Soviet system. In 1982 Mamoulian received the Directors Guild of
America D.W. Griffith Award. Mamoulian died in Los Angeles on December
4, 1987. "A film must have two elements &#8211; it must deal with the real
world and show how it could be made better," Mamoulian said in an
interview in 1983. </p>
