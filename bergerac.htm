<p>French soldier, satirist, and dramatist, whose life has been the
basis of many romantic but unhistorical legends. The best-known of them
is <a href="rostand.htm">Edmond Rostand</a>'s verse drama <i>Cyrano de Bergerac </i>(1897). Bergerac's major works were two posthumously published accounts of fantastic voyages,&nbsp; <em>Voyage dans la Lune</em> (1657) and&nbsp;<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>L'Histoire comique des États et Empires du Soleil</em></span></span> (1662). According to <a href="aclarke.htm">Arhur C. Clarke</a>, Cyrano must be credited both for first applying the rocket to space travel and, for inventing the ramjet. Cyrano wrote: </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I foresaw very well, that the vacuity
that would happen in the icosahedron, by reason of the sunbeams, united
by the concave glasses, would, to fill up the space, attract a great
abundance of air, whereby my box would be carried up; and that
proportionable as I mounted, the rushing wind that should force it
through the hole, could not rise to the roof, but that furiously
penetrating the machine, it must needs force it upon high."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds </font></i><font size="2">by Arhur C. Clarke, 2000)</font></blockquote>
<p>The real Cyrano de Bergerac had very little in common with the hero
of the Rostand play. He was born in Sens, south-east of Paris, the son
of Abel de Cyrano, a lawyer, and Esperance Bellenger. The name "de
Bergerac" derived from a place attached to one of his family's estates.
In 1622 Abel de Cyrano moved with his family to Mauvières. His early
education Cyrano received from a priest, whom he disliked and
repeatedly complained of his situation to his father. He was then sent
to the Collège de Beauvais. Its head-master, Jean Grangier, became the
model of Cyrano's play <i>The Pedant Outwitted</i> (1654). </p><p>
In 1637, Cyrano left Beauvais, and turned to a life of drinking,
gambling, and duelling. At nineteen he he entered the army, M. de
Carbon de Casteljaloux's company, which consisted almost entirely of
Gascons. Cyrano's friend Henry Le Bret later wrote that "duels, which
at that time seemed the unique and most rapid means of becoming known,
in a few days rendered him so famous that the Gascons, who composed
nearly whole company, considered him the demon of courage and credited
him with as many duels as he had ben with them days." However, he was
an individualist and had problems adjusting to discipline &#8211; Cyrano was
an opponent of the war and death penalty. His humanitarian way of
thinking was acknowledged by his contemporaries and the next
generations. Le Doyen's portrait of him, made after Heince, shows a
sceptically smiling man, with thin moustaches and a large nose.
Although he flirted with his cousin Madeleine, he was probably a
homosexual. </p>
<p>Cyrano was severely wounded twice, he was shot through the body, 
and at the siege of Arras in 1640 he was hit in the neck with a sword. Cyrano never fully recovered 
from this wound. During his convalescence in Paris Cyrano 
was helped financially by his cousin, Madeleine Robineau, the Baroness de Neuvillette, whom he used as a 
model for the 
beautiful Roxane. In the following year Cyrano gave up his military career and started to study under the 
philosopher and mathematician Pierre Gassendi. Influenced by Gassendi's theories and libertine philosophy, he 
wrote stories of imaginary journeys to the Moon and Sun, and satirized views, which saw humanity and the 
Earth as the center of creation. He also mocked Descartes' idea that animals are soulless machines. 
In his trip to the Moon the narratot takes off from the Earth in an apparatus festooned with firecrackers, and 
lands on the Tree of Life. The first person he meets is Elias, whom he upsets with his mocking comments about the 
soul. At the end he is thrown into the sky with an atheist, and lands safely in Italy. </p>
<p>Beginning from <em>Le Ministre d'Etat flambé</em> (1649), signed by
D.B., Bergerac&nbsp;wrote several political propaganda pamphlets, which
were dicected against&nbsp;Cardinal Jules Mazarin, but he then changed
his opinion and defended Mazarin in <em>La Lettre contre Les Frondeurs</em> (1651).&nbsp;Some biographers have claimed that Bergerac was bribed by the Cardinal. </p><p>In the 1650s Cyrano de Bergerac published two plays. The subject of<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>La Mort d'Agrippine</em> (1654, The Death of Agrippine) was drawn from the <em>Annals </em>of
Tacitus and told of an abortive revolt against the tyrant Tibère,
pursud by Agrippine, the widow of Germanicus, and members of the
tyrant's own family. The work&nbsp;was suspected of blasphemy for
playing on the double meaning of the word <i>l'hostie</i> (a hostage,
or victim). According to an anecdote, when one of the characters says,
"Frappons, voilà l'hostie," the audiece shouted: "Ah! the rascal! Ah!
The atheist! Hear how he speaks of the holy sacrament." From <em>Le Pédant joué</em> (1654) Molière borrowed heavily for his play <i>The Cheats of Chapin</i>. </p>
<p>Cyrano de Bergerac died in Paris on July 28, 1655. The cause of Cyrano's death was banal &#8211; according to some 
sources a piece of plank dropped on his head, but it did not kill him immediately. Most likely he died as a 
result of a street fight. Cyrano's "secret illness" may have been syphilis. His brother had him confined in a lunatic asylum. </p>

<p>Parts of his major work, <i>L&#8217;Autre monde ou les états et empires de la Lune</i>, were published in posthumous 
versions. <i>Other Worlds </i>continued the Rabelaisian tradition of satire and was based on Lucian's <i>A True 
Story</i>.
Henri Le Bret, the author's friend who was a Jesuit priest, censored
its heretical elements. In 1676 Cyrano's collected works appeared,
which included a biting poem of Mazarin (1602-61), the famous French
cardinal and statesman. Rostand's <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i> describes
the adventures of the 17th century nobleman, famous for his large nose
and swordsmanship. "'Tis well known, a big nose is indicative / Of a
soul affable, and kind, and courteous, / Liberal, brave, just like
myself, and such / As you can never dare to dream yourself..." Cyrano
desperately loves the beautiful Roxane, but agrees to help his rival,
Christian, win her heart. The historians have pointed out that
Rostand's portrayal of the hero was not truthful &#8211; Cyrano was a serious
writer of philosophical romances and a virile lover.</p>
<p>It is assumed, that the third volume in Cyrano Bergerac's series <i>Histoire comique</i> is lost or has been destroyed. The first two parts were <i>Comical History of the States and Empires 
of the Moon</i> and <i>Comical History of the States and Empires of the Sun</i>. Together known as 
<i>L'autre monde</i>, the books belong in the genre 'fantastic voyages', of which the oldest examples are the Sumerian Epic of <i>Gilgamesh</i>, from the third millenium BC, and Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, from the first. Johannes Kepler's <i>Somnium</i> (1643), Francis Bacon's <i>New Atlantis </i>(1627), and Tommasso Campanella's <i>City of the Sun </i>were
written in the 17th century. Bergerac introduced seven ways to leave
the Earth. One uses a sealed unit that draws in air, which is heated by
mirrors and then expelled at the base; this was perhaps the first
depiction of the ramjet principle, which was invented by René Lorin in
1913. <br>
</p>
      <p>Cyrano's imaginary visits to the moon and sun satirized the
people and politics of his own day. Cyrano is escorted on the Moon by
the Demon of Socrates, who says: "If there is something you men cannot
understand, you either imagine that it is spiritual or that it does not
exists. Both conclusions are quite false. The proof of this is the fact
that there are perhaps a million things in the universe which you would
need a million quite different organs to know. Myself, for example, I
know from my senses what attracts the lodestone to the pole, how the
tides pull the sea, what becomes of an animal after its death." <font size="2">(from <i>Trillion Years Spree</i> by Brian Aldiss &amp; David Wingrove, 2001) </font></p>

<p>In the second book he lands on the Sun, managing to invent an
explanation why the heat doesn't burn. He meets Campanella, author of <i>Civitas Solis</i>,
to whom a woman tells that her husband has killed her child twice. He
has not fulfilled his conjugal duty, because by refusing to make the
child "come into existence, he caused him not to be, which was the
first murder, but subsequently he caused him never to be able to be,
which was the second. A Common murderer knows that the man whose days
he cuts short is no more, but none of them could cause a man never to
have been." Cyrano's works influenced several later writers, among them
<a href="jswift.htm%20">Jonathan Swift</a> and <a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a>, whose fantastical <i>Micromégas: Histoire philosophique </i>(1752) satirized our world from the viewpoint of giant visitors from space. </p>
