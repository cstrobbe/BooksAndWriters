<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->One of the most important of English woman 
poets, who was the sister of the painter-poet <a href="dgrosset.htm">Dante Gabriel 
Rossetti</a>,
and a member of the Pre-Raphaelite art movement. 'A Birthday,' 'When I
Am Dead,' and 'Up-Hill' are probably Rossetti's best-known single
works. After a serious illness in 1874, she rarely received visitors or
went outside her home. Her favorite themes were unhappy love, death,
and premature resignation. Especially her later&nbsp;verse dealt with
somber religious feelings. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Does the road wind uphill all the way? </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Yes, to the very end. </font><br>
<font size="2">Will the day's journey take the whole long day?</font><br>
<font size="2">From morn to night, my friend. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'Up-Hill', 1861) </font></blockquote>
<p>Christina Rossetti was born in London, one of four children of
Italian parents. Her father was the poet Gabriele Rossetti (1783-1854),
professor of Italian at King's College from 1831. He resigned in 1845
because of blindness. All the four children in the family became
writers, Dante Gabriel also gained fame as a painter. Christina was
educated at home by her mother, Frances Polidori, a former governess,
an Anglican of devout evangelical bent. She shared her parents'
interest in poetry and was portrayed in the paintings and drawings of
the Pre-Raphaelites. <br>
</p>
      <p>Christina was the model for his brother's&nbsp;oil painting&nbsp;<i>The Girlhood of Mary Virgin</i> (1849), which was the first picture to be signed P.R.B. Jan Marsh has proposed in her biography <i>Christina Rossetti: A Writer's Life</i>
(1995) that Christina's secret was that she&nbsp;was sexually abused by
her father, but "perhaps like many abuse victims she banished the
knowledge from conscious memory." True or not, this kind of speculative
claims became highly popular in biographies in the 1990s. Diane D'Amico
has argued in <em>Christina Rossetti: Faith, Gender and Time</em> (1999) that "Rossetti was a complex woman who certainly had more than one secret." <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some of the symptoms of Rossetti's disorder were perhaps
self-inflicted. Germaine Greer has suggested that Rossetti's frustrated
sexuality and feelings of guilt may have resulted from her longing for
closeness with her brother Gabriel<font size="-1"> </font><font size="-1">(</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Slip-Shod Sibyls: Recognition, Rejection and the Woman Poet</span>, 1995, pp. 369-389). </font>At
the age of fifteen, she became an invalid. Her disease was diagnosed as
angina pectoris. However, she was far stronger than she believed
herself to be and outlived all her family, except her brother William
and his family.&nbsp;<font size="-1"> </font> 
      </p>

<p>Rossetti's first verses were written in 1842 and printed in the
private press of her grandfather. In 1850, under the pseudonym Ellen
Alleyne, she contributed seven poems to the short-lived Pre-Raphaelite
journal <i>The Germ</i>, founded by her brother William Michael and
his friends. When the family was in a financial trouble, she helped her
mother to keep a school at Frome, Somerset. The school was not a
success, and they returned in 1854 to London. Except for two brief
visits abroad, she lived with her mother all her life. </p>
<p>Rossetti's deeply religious temperament left its marks on her
writing. She was a devout High Anglican, much influenced by the
Tractarian, or Oxford, Movement. Rossetti broke engagement to the
artist James Collison, an original member of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood, when he joined the Roman Catholic church. She also
rejected Charles Bagot Cayley,&nbsp;the translator of Dante's <em>Commedia</em><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;for
religious reasons; he was an agnostic, and moreover, his "costume was
always shabby and out of date", as her brother William Michael
noted.&nbsp;Cayley remained her long-suffering admirer. </p><p>Rossetti's best-known collection,&nbsp;<em>Goblin Market and Other Poems</em>
(1862), established&nbsp;her fame&nbsp;as a significant voice in
Victorian poetry. The title poem is a cryptic fairy-tale and tells the
story of two sisters, Lizzie and Laura, who are tempted the eat the
fruit of the goblin men. After eating the fruit, Laura cannot see the
goblins. Lizzie, whose refusal have angered the goblins, is attacked by
them, and she saves her sister in an act of sacrifice. Laura, longing
to taste again the fruit, licks the juices with which Lizzie is
covered. "For there is no friend like a sister / In calm or stormy
weather." The collection was dedicated to her sister Maria Francesca,
who undertook the discipline of an Anglican sisterhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><em>&nbsp;</em></font><font size="3"><em> </em></font></p>
<p>By the 1880s, recurrent bouts of Graves' disease, a thyroid
disorder, had made Rossetti an invalid, and ended her attempts to work
as a governess. Rossetti's illness restricted her social life, but she
continued to write sonnets and ballads. Especially she was interested
the apocalyptic books, and such religious writers as Augustine and
Thomas à Kempis. She also admired George Herbert and John Donne. Among
her later works are&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>A Pageant and Other Poems</em></span> (1881), and <em>The Face of the Deep</em> (1892). She was considered a possible successor to <a href="tennyson.htm">Alfred Tennyson</a>
as poet laureate. To accept the challenge, she wrote a royal elegy.
However, Alfred Austin was appointed poet laureate in 1896. Rossetti
developed a fatal cancer in 1891, and died in London on December 29,
1894. </p>
<p>In 'After Death' (1849), the poet-speaker lays on a bed, with a
shroud on her face, observing the surroundings before the burial. "He
did not love me living; but once dead / He pitied me; and very sweet it
is / To know he still is warm tho' I am cold." The theme of death
appears next year also in her brother's poem 'My Sister's Sleep'
(1850), in which death visits a family on a Christmas Eve. </p><p><font size="3">The title work of <em>The Prince's Progress, and Other Poems (</em>1866)
drew, in places,&nbsp;on the imagery of Browning's 'Childe Roland to
the Dark Tower Came' (1855) and Edward Bulwer Lytton's <em>The Last Days of Pompeii</em>
(1834), which Rossetti had read in her youth. "A land of neither life
nor death, / Where no man buildeth or fashioneth, / Where none draws
living or dying breath; / No man cometh or goeth there, / No man doeth,
seeketh, saith, / In the stagnant air." Some of the poems in <em>Sing-Song: A Nursery Rhyme Book</em> (1872),&nbsp;such as 'Who Has Seen the Wind', are still popular. Rossetti also wrote religious prose works, such as <em>Seek and Find</em> (1879), <em>Called to Be Saints</em> (1881) and <em>The Face of the Deep.</em></font>
</p><p>William Michael Rossetti edited her complete works in 1904. He
once said that "Christina's habits of composing were eminently of the
spontaneous kind. I question her having ever once deliberated with
herself whether or not she would write something or other, and then,
after thinking out a subject, having proceeded to treat it in regular
spells of work. Instead of this, something impelled her feelings, or
"came into her head," and her hand obeyed the dictation. I suppose she
scribbled lines off rapidly enough, and afterwards took whatever amount
of pains she deemed requisite for keeping them in right form and
expression." Rossetti's work has suffered from reductive
interpretations, but she is increasingly being reconsidered as a major
Victorian poet. Typical for her poems was songlike use words and short,
irregularly rhymed lines. </p>
