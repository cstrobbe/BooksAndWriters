<p>Novelist, journalist, pacifist, and feminist, whose best-known novel <i>South Riding </i>(1936)
won posthumously the 1936 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. It was
partly based on Holtby's experiences as a teacher and her childhood
memories and experiences in the East Riding. Holtby's name is
inseparately linked with <a href="/britta.htm">Vera Brittain</a>'s, who described their partnership in her memoir <i>Testament of Friendship </i>(1940). Their friendship has become a feminist icon. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"To learn, to practise, to work, to see
all I can, to understand all I can.... And so, perhaps, one day be
worthy of being used, And if not </b></font><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><font size="2"><b> it's an honour that comes few; why should I expect to be privileged."</b> (Holtby in her letter to her mother in 1933, from</font><font size="2"> <i>The Clear Stream:The Life of Winifred Holtby</i> by Marion Shaw</font><font size="2">,
 1999) </font></blockquote>
<p>Winifred Holtby was born in Rudston, Yorkshire, the youngest daughter of  David Holtby, a farmer, 
and Alice Winn, who became the first woman  alderman in the East Riding County Council. In her early childhood 
Holtby developed love for the  Yorkshire countryside and later  portrayed its people and landscape  in her 
fiction. Dales country, where Holtby's mother was born, she portrayed in <i>The Land of Green Ginger</i>  
(1927). Due to her father's ill health, the household was mostly run by Winifred's mother. She encouraged 
her daughter to write poetry and had her first collection  printed &#8211; as a surprise &#8211; when Winifred was just 
13. </p>
<p>In 1909 Holtby entered Queen Margaret's School in Scarborough where
she wrote for the school magazine. She enrolled in 1917 in Somerville
College, one of the female colleges at Oxford, but broke off her
university career to work in a London nursing home and serve as a
volunteer in the Signal Unit of the Women's Auxiliary Corps. She was
posted in France in 1918 and returned the next year to Oxford to finish
her history studies. In 1921 she became one of the first women to be awarded a degree by the university. <br>
</p>
<p>While at Oxford she met Vera Brittain, with whom she
shared in London a flat with a tortoise. The arrangement continued
until her death. When Brittain married the political scientist George
Catlin, she continued to live with the couple. After graduating Holtby worked as a journalist, writing for the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, <i>Daily Express</i>, 
<i>Evening Standard</i>, <i>Good Housekeeping</i>, and the <i>News Chronicle</i>. In 1926 she became director of 
<i>Time and Tide</i>, a feminist weekly. Her first novel,  <i>Anderby Wold</i>, came out in 1923. <br>
</p>
      <p>In addition to her 
writing, Holtby  devoted herself to social causes and international questions. She helped Labour Party candidates, 
lectured on women's rights for the League of Nations Union and Six Point Group. In 1929 Holtby published 
<i> A New Voter's Guide to Party Programmes</i>,  directed for women after they got in 1928 the right to vote in 
Great Britain &#8211; 22 years after Finnish women, who were granted the vote in 1906, the first in Europe. </p>

<p>In 1926 Holtby spend six months in South Africa, where she learned about the conditions of native South Africans 
and began speak for the unionization of black workers. "She went to preach 
the gospel of peace to white South Africa,"  wrote Vera Brittain in <i>Testament of Friendship</i> (1940), 
"she returned to plead, with passion and pertinacity, the cause of black South Africa to an 
indifferent England." Holtby's observations of racism found their way to the novel<i> Mandoa, 
Mandoa! </i>(1933). In the story, set in a fictitious African state, Holtby  satirized the unfortunate British travel 
industry. <i>The Astonishing Island</i> (1933) was also satirical and examined contemporary English customs and ways 
of life.</p>


<p>Like Brittain, Holtby basically believed, that all writing should
have a purpose behind it. The protagonists in Holtby's novels were
often strong-willed and courageous, whose struggle reflected her own
experiences and feminist views, like the social crusader of <i>Poor Caroline</i> (1931) or the heroine from   <i>Land of Green Ginger</i>, who rises above her oppressive farmhouse surroundings. </p>
<p>Holtby's other works include a critical study of <a href="/vwoolf.htm">Virginia Woolf</a> (1932),<i> 
Women in a Changing Civilization</i> (1934), a history of the women's movement which was a commercial success, 
and a play, <i>Take Back Your Freedom</i>, with an anti-Fascist theme. It was revised and completed by Norman 
Ginsbury and first produced in 1940. Holtby's correspondence with Vera Brittain was collected in <i>Letters 
to a Friend </i>(1937).
Holtby once wrote to Brittain, "We are so entangled now in people's
minds that Lady Steele Maitland, my chairman at Thursday's meeting,
introduced me as 'Miss Vera Holtby!' to loud laughter and applause." Holtby dismissed rumours of lesbianism as "Too, <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span> Chelsea." <br>
</p>
      <p>From an early age, Holtby also wrote poems. However, she destroyed them or left 
unfinished. Her posthumous collection, entitled <i>The Frozen Earth and Other Poems</i> (1935), was compiled by 
Vera Brittain. One of the pieces, 'For the Ghost of Elinor Wylie,' first printed in 
<i>Time and Tide</i> in December 1933, was about the American poet and novelist, who died from a disease similar to 
Holtby's own. </p>

<p>Holtby suffered from a heart condition, which gradually diminished
her energy. When she collapsed in 1932, she was told it was exhaustion
due to overwork. While travelling round France in 1933, she had a
sequece of headaches, which she tried to cure with brandy and soda.
After the second collapse, she was diagnosed as having Bright's disease
(a kidney disease). As a "woman in here time," Holtby was involved in a
number of activities. In 1935, just before her death, she received a
letter from Virginia Woolf, asking if she would write an autobiography
for the Hogarth Press. "I don't see how I can write an autobiography,"
she told Vera Brittain. "I never fell I've really had a life of my own.
My existence seems to me like a clear stream which has simply reflected
other people's stories and problems." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Clear Stream</font></i><font size="2"> by Marion Shaw, 1999) </font></p>
<p>Holtby died on 29 September 1935, but managed to complete  <i>South Riding</i>.
It was published with the help of Vera Brittain, her literary executor,
although Holtby's mother Alice did not approve its portrayal of herself
and her work as a county councilor. The book has remained in print ever
since. Upon its publication, Mrs Holtby resigned from the East Riding
County Council. The Winifred Holtby Prize for best regional novel was
established in 1967. <br>
 </p>
<p><i>South Riding</i> was set in a fictional part of Yorkshire and
offered a panoramic view of the author's native county and its people.
Among its wide array of characters are Sarah Burton, the newly arrived
and enterprising headmistress of the local girl's school, Mrs. Beddows,
a wise but autocratic alderwoman, modeled after Holtby's mother, Robert
Carne, a gentleman-farmer and the local squire, and Lydia Holly, a girl
from the slum. Mrs. Beddows is a plump sturdy little woman, who enjoys
her popularity and has naturally racy tongue. Sarah Burton, the
advocate of social change, believes
that she was born to be a spinster, but she falls in love with Crane,
who is stuck to his conservative views. The story was filmed in 1937
(directed by Victor Saville, starring Ralph Richardson, Edna Best,
Edmund Gwenn, Ann Todd), and later on serialized for television in 1974
and 2011. </p>
