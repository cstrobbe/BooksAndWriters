<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->French philosopher, "the father of modern
philosophy," scientist and mathematician, whose philosophical
conclusion, "Cogito; ergo sum" (Je pense, donc je suis; I think,
therefore I am), is the best-known quotation in all philosophy and
which revolutionized the ways of thinking. In somewhat different form,
it is also found in Augustine (354-430), who thought that the mind can
have absolute and certain knowledge only about what is directly and
immediately presented to it. Being a mathematician Descartes decided to
apply the so certain-seeming methods of mathematical reasoning to
philosophy. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Good sense is of all things in the world
the most equally distributed, for everybody thinks he is so well
supplied with it, that even those most difficult to please in all other
matters never desire more of it than they already possess." </b>(from<i> Le Discours de la Méthode</i>, 1637) </font></blockquote>

<p>René Descartes was born in La Haye (now called La Haye-Descartes),
into a well-to-do family. His mother died soon after his birth.
Joachim, his father, was a judge in the High Court of Brittany; he soon
remarried and Descartes was brought up by his maternal grandmother. At
the age of ten he was sent to the Jesuit College at La Flèche in Anjou,
where his masters allowed him to stay late in bed because of his poor
health. Descartes later described La Flèche as one of the best schools
in Europe. Descartes studied classical literature, history, rhetoric,
and natural philosophy. In 1616 he obtained a degree in law from the
University of Poitiers. At the age of twenty-two, he enrolled in the
Protestant Dutch army of Maurice of Nassau. He spent several years as a
soldier and met the Dutchman Isaac Beeckman, who awakened his interest
in mathematics. For Beeckman he dedicated one of his earliers works, <i>Compendium Musicae</i>,
which was written in 1618. In 1619 he served in the Bavarian army.
While on duty at Ulm, he devised a methodology for the unification of
the sciences. According to a story, Descartes had spent a cold morning
in a "stove-heated room" (or in some sources in a large oven, <i>poêle</i>), and when he came out, half of his philosophy had got ready. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I saw quite clearly that, assuming a
triangle, its three angles must be equal to two right angles; but for
all that I saw nothing that assured me that there was any triangle in
the real world. On the other hand, going back to an examination of my
idea of a perfect being. I found that this included the existence of a
such a being, in the same way as the idea of a triangle includes the
equality of its three angles to two right angles... Consequently it is
at least as certain that God, the perfect being in question, is or
exists, as any proof in geometry can be." <font size="2"><b> </b></font></b><font size="2">(from<i> Le Discours de la Méthode</i>) </font></font>
</blockquote>
<p>From 1619 to 1627 Descartes lived in Paris. He spent the rest of his
life traveling outside France, settling eventually in Holland, where he
remained from 1629 to 1649, his great creative years. There he devoted
himself to philosophy and sciences, resolve "no longer to seek any
other science than the knowledge of myself, or of the great book of the
world." Although he was Catholic, Descartes opposed scholasticism. To
put an end to the current philosophical ideas that went so far as to
deny one's own existence, he started to inquire human knowledge on the
basis of methodological skepticism, "Cartesian doubt". He introduced
the famous of device of a malignant demon, "who has employed all his
energies in deceiving me." But however great the demon's deception and
how much the senses sometimes deceive, "he can never cause me to be
nothing so long as I think I am something." Descartes argued that one
can doubt all, but not one's own existence as a thinking being, "for
example that I am here seated by the fire wearing a dressing gown."<b></b>
Existence, being a perfection, can no more be separated from the
concept of a supremely perfect being. From this he concluded that God
must exist and because God cannot be a deceiver, the significance on
sensory data must be evaluated by reason. Descartes's friend Antoine
Arnaud among others criticized his reasoning. "We can be sure that God
exists, only because we clearly and evidently perceive that he does;
therefore, prior to being certain that God exists, we need to be
certain that whatever we clearly and evidently perceive is true."
Although one can doubt that there was any circularity (the "Cartesian
circle") in Descartes's original arguments, he had to maintain that
there are some basic logical truths, which are present in us from
birth, such as something cannot both be and not to be at the same time.
</p>
<p>By 1634 Descartes had completed his <i>Le Monde</i> (The World), but withdrew it after hearing what the Inquisition thought of  Galileo.  <i>Discourses on the First Philosophy</i> was published in 1641, together with a series of <i>Objections</i>
by noted thinkers. Descartes also was the founder of analytical
geometry. In his thirties he wrote a treatise on dioptrics which was a
substantial contribution to the science of optics and he composed one
of the first scientific treatises on meteorology. In 1637 Descartes
decided to publish his dioptrics, his geometry, and his meteorology;
and he prefaced these works with a brief <i>Discourse on the Method of rightly conducting one's reason and reaching the truth in the sciences</i>.
The three scientific studies are now part of the history of science.
According to some estimations, the preface is reprinted every year and
has been translated into more than hundred languages. </p>
<p><i>Discourse on Method </i>was written in
French and not in the more conventional Latin, and addressed to the general
reader.  The autobiographical work is divided into six parts. Descartes 
portrays himself as a sort of Socrates in search of truth and
wisdom. The first two parts depict his early philosophical doubts,
and culminate in the discovery of his "method". He finds four rules
for reforming his own ways of thinking: first, accept nothing that
is not clear and distinct; second, divide difficult subjects into many
small parts; third, start with the simplest problems; fourth, be
comprehensive. &#8211; In the third part Descartes explains his system of
morality, metaphysics in part 4, in part 5 he describes his model of
cosmos and the mechanics of human body, especially the workings of the
circulation system. Part 6 provides an introduction to the essays on
meteorology and optics. &#8211; Although <i>Discourse</i> was an economical 
disappointment for Descartes in sales figures, it attracted a wide and
immediate reaction. </p>
<p>Descartes's publications brought him fame throughout Europe. He entered into 
correspondence with most of the learned men of his time. In 1644 he published, 
in Latin, <i>The Principles of Philosophy</i>, which he hoped to gain similar 
position as standard texts based on Aristotle. The last of his full-length works, 
<i>The Passions of the Soul</i>, grew out of his correspondence with Princess Elizabeth 
of Bohemia, the niece of Charles I of England, but dedicated to Queen Christina of Sweden. 
In it he argued, that the mind is not directly affected by any part of the body, except the 
pineal gland in the brain. All sensations consist of motions in the body which travel 
through the nerves to this gland and there give a signal to the mind, which calls up a 
certain experience. Mind and body are distinct substances, which made immortality possible. </p>
<p>In 1649 Descartes went to Sweden, where he was invited by the Queen
Christina (1626-89) to teach her philosophy at five o'clock in the morning and 
establish an institute for sciences. Descartes arrived in October at Stockholm, where 
he settled in the 
home of his friend Chanut at 
the French embassy, opposite the the Royal Palace. The climate did not suit him and   
he was  forced to break his usual habit of late rising. To the palace 
he went by carriage. Christina 
herself proved to be a dedicated student, although too much obsessed with studying Greek.  In February 1650, 
Descartes caught cold. He was not treated by Queen's first physician, the Frenchman du Ryer, 
but by his intellectual enemy at the court,  a physician named  Weulles.  Descartes died 
in Stockholm on February 11, 1650. His remains were first buried in a tomb in a 
Catholic cemetery and  later transferred to Paris &#8211;  
possibly at that time his head had been separated from the body and was missing. 
Following Descartes's death, rumors began 
to circulate that he had been poisoned. In 1654, Christina 
abdicated her throne and converted to Catholicism. She died in Rome in 1689. 
Descartes's (alleged) skull was auctioned off in 1821, the buyer was a casino owner, who gave it 
to the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius. The jawless skull was eventually placed on display 
at the Musée de l'Homme, 
near the skull of the Neanderthal man.

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"One cannot conceive anything so strange 
and so implausible that it has not already been said by one philosopher or 
another."</b></font> <font size="2"><b> </b>(from<i> Le Discours de la 
Méthode</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Descartes's conceptions of philosophy and science influenced deeply European culture and thinking. 
Even his opponents, <a href="bpascal.htm">Blaise Pascal </a>(1623-1662), and later among others 
<a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a> (1694-1778), who satirized Descartes's theory of vortices, 
largely followed him in his emphasis on analysis and in rejection of tradition. Stephen Toulmin 
has argued in <i>Cosmopolis</i> (1990) that Descartes and his followers suppressed the emergence 
of true modernity &#8211; tolerance, relativism, and indeterminacy &#8211; for over 300 years with their attempt 
to unify all knowledge through the power of reason and create a cosmopolis, an unchanging, logically 
based system for the human and natural worlds. "Cartesian dualism" &#8211; the separation between 
the mental and the physical &#8211; has been criticized from many points of view. Descartes 
wrote: "This 'I' &#8211; that is, the soul, by which I am what I am, is entirely distinct from the 
body, and would not fail to be what it is even if the body did not exist." According to Gilbert 
Ryle, this conception is based on category-mistake. "It is perfectly proper to say, in one logical 
tone of voice, that there exist minds, and to say, in another logical tone of voice, that there exist 
bodies. But these expressions do not indicate two different species of existence, for 'existence' is 
not a generic word like 'coloured' or 'sexed'. They indicate two different senses of 'exist', 
somewhat as 'rising' has different senses in 'the tide is rising', hopes are rising', and 'the 
average age of death is rising'."<b></b><font size="2"></font><font size="2">
