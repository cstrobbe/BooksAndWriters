<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American writer, famous for her race relations
novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> To Kill a Mockingbird</span>, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.
The book became an international bestseller and was adapted into screen in
1962. Lee was 34 when the work was published, and it has remained her only novel. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make
music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest
in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.
That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."</b></font></blockquote>

<p>Harper Lee was born in Monroeville, Alabama. Her father was a former
newspaper editor and proprietor, who had served as a state senator and
practiced as a lawyer in Monroeville. Lee studied law at the University
of Alabama from 1945 to 1949, and spent a year as an
exchange student in Oxford University, Wellington Square. Six months
before finishing her studies, she went to New York to pursue a literary
career. During the 1950s, she worked as an airline reservation clerk
with Eastern Air Lines and British Overseas Airways. In 1959 Lee
accompanied <a href="capote.htm">Truman Capote</a> to Holcombe,  Kansas, as a research assistant for Capote's classic 'non-fiction'  novel <i>In Cold Blood</i> (1966). </p>
<p> <i>To Kill a Mockingbird </i>was Lee's first novel. The book is set
in Maycomb, Alabama, in the 1930s. Atticus Finch, a lawyer and a
father, defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a
poor white girl, Mayella Ewell.
The setting and several of the characters are drawn from life &#8211; Finch
was
the maiden name of Lee's mother, and the character of Dill was drawn
from Capote, Lee's childhood friend. The trial itself has parallels to
the infamous "Scottboro Trial," in which the charge was rape. In both,
too, the defendants were African-American men and the accusers white
women. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But there is one way in this country in
which all men are created equal &#8211; there is one human institution that
makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of
an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president.
That institution, gentlemen, is a court. It can be the Supreme Court of
the United States of the humblest J.P. court in the land, or this
honorable court which you serve. Our courts have their faults, as does
any human institution, but in this country our courts are the great
levelers, and in our courts all men are created equal."</b> <font size="2">(Finch defending Tom Robinson)</font></font></blockquote>

<p>The narrator is Finch's daughter, nicknamed Scout, an immensely
intelligent and observant child. She starts the story when she is six
and relates many of her experiences, usual interests of a child, and
events which break the sheltered world of childhood. Her mother is dead
and she tries to keep pace with her older brother Jem. He breaks his
arm so badly that it heals shorter than the other. One day the children
meet Dill, their new seven-year-old friend. They become interested in
Boo Radley, a recluse man in his thirties. However, he is not the
frightening person as they first had imagined. During the humorous and
sad events Scout and Jem learn a lesson in good and evil, and
compassion and justice. As Scout's narrative goes on, the reader
realizes that she will never kill a mockingbird or become a racist.
Scout tells her story in her own language, which is obviously that of a
child, but she also analyzes people and their actions from the
viewpoint of an already grown-up, mature person. </p>
<p>The first plot tells the story of Boo Radley, who is generally
considered deranged, and the second concerns Tom Robinson. A jury of
twelve white men believe two whites and refuse to look past the color
of man's skin. They convict Robinson of a crime, rape, he did not
commit.<font size="2"> </font>Atticus, assigned to
defend Tom, loses in court. Tom tries to escape and is shot dead. Bob
Ewell, Mayella's father, is obviously guilty of beating her for making
sexual advances toward Tom. Bob attacks Jem and Scout because Atticus
has exposed his daughter and him as liars. The children are saved by
Boo Radley. Bob Ewell is found dead with a knife in his side. Atticus
and Calpurnia, the black cook, slowly take the position of the moral
centre of the book. They are portrayed as pillars of society who do not
share society's prejudices. The story emphasizes that the children are
born with an instinct for justice and absorb prejudices in the
socialization process. Tom is a scapegoat of society's prejudice and
violence. "Mr. Finch, there's just some kind of men you have to shoot
before you can say hidy to 'em. Even then, they ain't worth the bullet
it takes to shoot 'em. Ewell 'as one of 'em." </p>
<p>Although her first novel gained a huge success, Lee did not continue
her literary career, although she worked for years on a second novel
and a book of nonfiction. She returned from New York to Monroeville,
where
she has lived with her sister Alice, avoiding interviews. In 2007, Lee
was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by George Bush. </p>
<p><i>To Kill a Mockingbird </i> has been translated into several
languages. An illustrated English edition appeared in Moscow in 1977
for propaganda reasons. In the foreword Nadiya Matuzova, Dr.Philol.,
wrongly stated that "Harper Lee did not live to see her fiftieth
birthday," but added rightly: "But her only, remarkable novel which
continued the best traditions of the American authors who wrote about
America's South &#8211; Mark Twain, William Faulkner, Erskine Caldwell and
many others &#8211; will forever belong in the treasure of progressive
American literature." </p>

Harper Lee, the casting was precisely right - the studio had turned
down Rock Hudson, who had discovered Lee's novel, and bought the rights
for Gregory Peck. Before beginning of his work, Peck went to Alabama
and met the real Atticus Finch, Lee's father Amasa Lee. In gratitude
for his performance, Lee presented him with her father's own watch.

the Cult of Childhood to the Negro Problem with disastrous results.
Before the intellectual confusion of the project is considered, it
should be noted that this is not much of a movie even by purely formal
standards." </b>(Andrew Sarris, <i>Village Voice</i>, March 7, 1963)  </font></font>
