<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Critically regarded as one of the most
significant American poets of the 20th century. Stevens largely ignored
the literary world and he did not receive widespread recognition until
the publication of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Collected
Poems</span> (1954). Stevens explored inside a profound philosophical
framework the dualism between concrete reality and the human
imagination. "The poem must resist the intelligence / Almost
successfully," Stevens wrote in 1949 in 'Man Carrying Thing.' For most
of his adult life, Stevens pursued contrasting careers as an insurance
executive and a poet.</p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2"><font size="2"><b>I know noble
accents</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;</font><br>
        <font size="2">
But I know, too,</font><br>
        <font size="2">
That the blackbird is involved</font><br>
        <font size="2">
In what I know.</font></b><br>
        </font></b><font size="2"><font size="2">(from </font><font size="2">'</font><font size="2">Thirteen Ways of Looking at a
Blackbird'</font><font size="2">)</font></font><b><font size="2"> </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>Wallace Stevens was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the son of
Garrett Barcalow Stevens, a prosperous country lawyer. His mother's
family, the Zellers, was of Dutch origin; she taught at school. Stevens
attended the Reading Boys' High School, and enrolled in 1893 at Harvard
College. During this period Stevens began to write for the <i>Harvand
Advocate, </i><i>Trend</i>, and Harriet Monroe's magazine <i>Poetry</i>.
Stevens' literary aspirations were encouraged by<i> </i>George
Santayana, who taught at Harvard University from 1889 to 1912. His
first play, <span style="font-style: italic;">Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise</span>,
won that magazine's prize
for verse drama in 1916. It was produced in the following year at New
York's Provincetown Playhouse. When the Wisconsin Players toured in the
eastern United States, and appeared at the Neighborhood Playhouse in
the New York City, a reviewer wrote in the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> of his one-act piece <span style="font-style: italic;">Carlos Among the Candles</span>:&nbsp;
"It is by itself a not uninteresting experiment in atmospheres, a game
of hide and seek among the shadows of thought, a pursuit of elusive
visions of unreality that the hand never closes on."<br>
 </p>
      <p>After leaving Harvard without degree in 1900, Stevens worked
as a reporter for the <i>New York Tribune</i>. He then entered New
York Law School, graduated in 1903, and was admitted to the bar next
year. With Lyman Ward he formed a law partnership, which lasted only a
short period. </p>
      <p>From 1905 to 1907 Stevens worked as an attorney for a number
of law firms, such as Eugene A. Philbin, Eaton and Lewis, and Eustis
and Foster. In 1908 he secured a position with the American Bonding
Company. Stevens married in 1909 Elsie Kachel Moll, from his home town;
they had met in 1904. Stevens once said that "she was the most
beautiful girl in Reading". Elsie had served Adolph Weinman as the
model for the Mercury dime and the Liberty half-dollar. Before the
marriage she had worked as a saleslady, milliner and stenographer, she
had also learned to play the piano. For her twenty-second birthday in
June 1908, he wrote twenty poems. Their daughter, Holly Bright, was
born in 1924. She later edited her father's letters. The marriage was
unhappy but stable. Elsie was fanatical in her housekeeping, she did
not like city life, and she disapproved of her husband's drinking
habits. Stevens often invited colleagues to lunch with him at
Hartford's Canoe Club, but he did not like visitors at home &#8211; he kept
distance to people while gaining also fame as a serious joker. Stevens
spent much time with avant-garde writers and artist around Walter
Arensberg, his Harvard classmate and art collector. </p>
      <p>Influenced by imagism (see <a href="epound.htm">Ezra Pound</a>)
and <a href="mallarme.htm">French symbolism</a>, Stevens wrote 'Sunday
Morning', his famous breakthrough poem. It starts with 'coffee and
oranges in a sunny chair' but end with images of another reality,
death, and universal chaos. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>She hears, upon that water without
soud, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">A voice that cries: "The tomb in Palestine, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Is not the porch of spirits lingering; </font><br>
        <font size="2">It is the grave of Jesus, where He lay." </font><br>
        <font size="2">We live in an old chaos of the sun, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Or old dependency of day and night, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Of that wide water, inescapable. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Sunday Morning') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Stevens published his first collection of verse, <span style="font-style: italic;">Harmonium</span> (1923), at the age of
forty-four. Although it was well received by some reviewers, such <a href="mmoor.htm">Marianne Moore</a>, it sold only 100 copies. "From
one end of the book to the other there is not an idea that can vitally
affect the mind, there is not a word that can arouse emotion. The
volume is a glittering edifice of icicles. Brilliant as the moon, the
book is equally dead," wrote Percy Hutchison in <i>The New York Times</i>
      <font size="2">(August 9, 1931)</font>. Now the collection is
regarded as one of the great works of American poetry.<i> </i></p>
      <p><i>Harmonium</i> included 'The Emperor of the Ice Cream', one
of Stevens' own favorite poems, 'Le Monocle de Mon Oncle', 'The Man
Whose Pharynx Was Bad', and 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird'.
The poems were partly autobiographical, also referring to the failure
of the author's marriage. 'The Emperor of Ice-Cream' is not about what
its title says, but more about death seen in harsh light &#8211; 'If her
horny feet protrude, they come / To show how cold she is, and dumb" &#8211;
and respect in front of too-short life &#8211; "Bring flowers in last month's
newspapers." </p>
      <p>In the mid-1910s, Stevens moved to Connecticut, where he
worked as a specialist in investment banking of the Hartford Accident
and Indemnity Company &#8211; one of the largest in the USA. Younger staff
members learned to appreciate Stevens' wordplays and his habit of
quizzing them on the meaning of a word.</p>
      <p>Business trips to the various parts of the country and the
investigation of insurance claims took most of Stevens' time and he
published little. His secretary undertook the duty of typing up the
drafts of his poems. Stevens also suffered from blurring of vision &#8211;
eventually he took three medicines for his eyes. To William Carlos
Williams he said: "my job is not now with poets from Paris. It is to
keep the fire-place burning and the music-box churning and the wheels
of the baby's chariot turning and that sort of thing."
In 1934 Stevens was named a vice president of the company. Stevens had
declared Elsie that he did not desire money, but at Harford their
financial situation was secured and some of the pressures in the
marriage eased. The Depression did not affect them much; Stevens earned
$20,000 in the middle of it. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ideas of Order</span>
(1935), Stevens' next collection of poems, received mixed critics, with
accusations of indifference to political and social tensions of the day
from the Marxist journal <i>New Masses</i>. However, according to Joan
Richardson's biography from 1988, Stevens was a closet socialist during
the 1930's, but did not make his views a public issue <font size="2">(see
      </font><i><font size="2">Wallace Stevens: The Later Years,
1923-1955</font></i><font size="2">)</font>. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Owl's Clover</span> (1936) Stevens
meditated on art and politics, as a reaction to the critic of
politically committed critics. <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Man with the Blue Guitar and Other Poems</span> (1937) affirmed that
"Poetry / Exceeding music must take place / Of empty heaven and its
hymns." </p>
      <p>From the early 1940s Stevens entered a period of creativity
that continued until his death in Hartford on August 2, in 1955. He
turned gradually away from the playful use of language to a more
reflective, though abstract style. Among his acclaimed poems were
'Notes toward a Supreme Fiction', 'The Auroras of Autumn', 'An Ordinary
Evening in New Haven', and 'The Planet on the Table'. Echoing the ideas
of Baudelaire, Stevens argued in 'Esthétique du Mal' that beauty is
inextricably linked with evil. Stevens also pondered much on the nature
of writing and in 'A Primitive Like an Orb' he stated: "We do not prove
the existence of the poem. / It is something seen and known in lesser
poems. / It is the huge, high harmony that sounds / A little and a
little, suddenly, / By means of a separate sense." </p>
      <p>Before gaining national fame as a poet, Stevens enjoyed a high
respect among his colleagues, although his acquaintance with Robert
Frost never grew into a true friendship. Like Frost, he often
vacationed in Key West, where he once had a fistfight with Ernest
Hemingway, breaking his right hand on the novelist's jaw. Hemingway, a
vastly superior boxer compared to the overweight Stevens, later boasted
in a letter, that "Didn't harm my jaw at all and so put him down again
and then fixed him good so he was in his room for five days with a
nurse and Dr. working on him." When Frost visited Hartford, Elsie
insulted their rather touchy guest. "You know, she insults everybody,"
explained Stevens. </p>
      <p>Stevens' work as a corporate lawyer did not much affect his
role a lyric poet &#8211; and he never retired from his job to devote himself
entirely to writing, to set up "words in their sites". Partly due to
his stand, that "poetry is nothing if it is not emperiment in
language," he was criticized in the 1920's for having no moral purpose,
and in the 1930s for lack of political purpose. Like the Italian
novelist and businessman <a href="svevo.htm">Italo Svevo</a>, Stevens
managed to balance between the world of counting and numbers and the
freedom of imagination, concluding once that "unreal things have a
reality of their own, in poetry as elsewhere." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The Necessary Angel</font></i><font size="2">, 1951)</font>
In 1946 Stevens was elected to the National Institute of Arts and
Letters, in 1950 he received the Bollingen Prize in Poetry, and in 1955
he was awarded both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Some of his late poems, not included in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Collected Poems</span>, appeared as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Palm at the End of the Mind</span> (1967), edited by his daughter, Holly Stevens. <br>
