<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->German philosopher, professor of
logic and metaphysics, whose masterpiece, <i>The Critique of Pure
Reason</i>, appeared in 1781 and then in a substantially revised
edition in 1787. The work was an answer to Descartes's skepticism about
knowledge. Kant's aim was to make philosophy, for the first time, truly
scientific, but his jargon made his central writings nearly impossible
for the uninitiated to understand. Even professional philosophers have
had problems with Kant. A.J. Ayer (1910-1989), the writer of <i>Language,
Truth and Logic</i>, tells that he read<i> The Critique</i> on a ship
bound for the Gold Coast. After a sunstroke, he fully grasped Kant's
work in a state of epiphany, but once he had recovered he had lost the
insight. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Two things fill the mind with
ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely
the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and
the moral law within me."</b> (from <i>Citique of Practical Reason</i>,
1799) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Immanuel Kant was born in Königsberg (Kaliningrad), which then
was the eastern part of Prussia. His father, Johann Georg
Kant,&nbsp;was a poor but respected saddler, whose strict pietistic
Protestantism made a lasting impression upon his son. Johann's wife,
Anna&nbsp;Regina (née Reuter), was the daughter of another harness
maker. Immanuel was the fourth child, but two of his siblings
had&nbsp;already died.<strong> </strong>Of the five siblings born
after him, only three survived early childhood. </p>
      <p>Kant attended the Collegium Fridericianum, and at the age of
16 he entered the University of Köningsberg, where he studied
philosophy, mathematics,
and physics, and attended lectures in theology. When his father died in
1746, Kant's financial situation became difficult. His mother had died
nine years earlier. To earn his living,&nbsp;he served as a private
tutor from 1747 to 1754 in various provincial households.&nbsp;Though
penniless&nbsp;he found much time for scientific research. In&nbsp;<em>General
History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens</em> (1755) he
argued&nbsp;that the system of heavenly bodies could have developed
from an unformed nebula. His doctor's degree Kant received for the work
      <i>On Fire</i>, and was appointed a lecturer at the university.
      </p>
      <p>Kant taught logic, metaphysics, moral philosophy, natural
theology, anthropology, as well as mathematics, physics, and physical
geography. His income during the first years was very small, and he
wore the same coat until it was worn out. When his friends refused to
buy him a new one, he refused. Later in life he was known as a person
of elegance. He was 1.57 meters tall (5 feet 2 inches), slender, with
eyes of&nbsp; light sky blue. One contemporary said: "It is impossible
to describe the bewitched effect of his look on my feeling when I sat
across him and when he suddenly raised his lowered eyes to look at me.
I always felt as if I looked through this blue ether-like fire into the
most holy of Minerva." </p>
      <p>In 1756&nbsp;Kant wrote on the earthquake in Lisbon, which his
great French contemporary <a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a> dealt in
the satirical story <i>Candide </i>(1759). Kant himself almost never
laughed,&nbsp;and like Buster Keaton, he&nbsp;told&nbsp;funny
anecdotes&nbsp;with a stone face.&nbsp;After&nbsp;he had unsuccessfully
applied in 1758 for professorship, he wrote an essay on optimism. One
of his students during the early sixties was Johann Gottfried Herder
(1744-1893), who became one of the most important writers of the <em>Sturm
and Drang</em> movement. Kant reviewed Herder's <em>Ideen zur
Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit</em> (Ideas Toward a
Philosophy of the History of Man) very critically. In 1766 he worked as
an assistant-librarian in the royal palace. He declined the offers of
professorship at the universities of Erlangen and Jena, and eventually
in 1770 Kant was appointed professor of logic and metaphysics&nbsp;at
Köningsberg. His inaugural dissertation was <i>On the Forms and
Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World. </i></p>
      <p>Before retiring, Kant&nbsp;served as&nbsp;the
&nbsp;dean of the faculties six times and rector of the university
twice. During this period he published <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>,
      <i>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics</i> (1783), <i>Critique
of Practical Reason </i>(1788), and <i>Critique of Judgment</i>
(1790). Kant never left his home town to see the world&nbsp;beyond his
limited horizon. Outside the walls of the university Rousseau published
      <i>Confessions</i> (1781), Goethe wrote <i>Faust</i>, and the
French Revolution abolished absolute monarchy.&nbsp;Kant believed in
his own rational thinking, and did not consider traveling necessary to
solve the problems of philosophy. However,&nbsp;he was not withdrawn
until late in life. He enjoyed conversation and was very interested in
the accounts of travellers. His lectures were freely delivered, spiced
with humor. Kant's friends included the famous Jewish philosopher Moses
Mendelssohn, the writer Theodor Gottlieb Hippel, the book dealer and
publisher Johann Jakob Kanter, Countess Caroline Charlotte Amalie
Keyserlingk, the moral philosopher Jacob Christian Kraus, and the
mathematician and philosopher Johann Heinrich Lambert.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Kant's daily luncheons with his friends frequently ran on
through the afternoon until four or five o'clock. His menus were
simple: three courses, followed by cheese.Kant adored especially English cheese. 
All courses were accompanied with mustard. He drank red wine, usually
Medoc, and white wine, as a way to of relieving the astringent
after-effects of the red wine. After dinner he drank a glass of dessert
wine, which was warmed and scented with orange peel. <br>
      </p>

      <p>According to an anecdote, Kant's life habits were so regular,
that people used to set their clocks by him as the philosopher passed
their houses on his daily walk&nbsp;&#8211; the only time when the schedule
changed was when Kant read Jean-Jacques Rousseau's <i>Emile</i>,
and
forgot the walk. Martin Lampe, Kant's servant, was a retired
soldier, who drank heavily. His last lecture Kant held in 1796. During
the last years of his life, his physical and mental powers deteriorated
noticeably. He developed delusions about electricity and began to
believe that it causes peculiar configurations of clouds and a
widespread disease amongst cats. In 1802 he dismissed Lampe, for
treating him in a way which he was ashamed to repeat. In his diary he
wrote: "The name of Lampe must now be remembered no more." <br>
</p>
      <p>Kant died on February 12, 1804, less than two months
before his eightieth birthday. For the next two weeks, people lined up
to see his dried out corpse, which looked "like a skeleton that one
might exhibit." Kant never married. After his death an anonymous
writer, most probably Johann Daniel Metzger, a professor of medicine at
the university of Königsberg, published a book which slandered Kant's
character: he was an egoist and a miser,&nbsp;did not tolerate
criticism, disliked religious people, mistreated his servans, and his
sister was not allowed to eat at his table. Moreover, he defended the
principles of the French Revolution. &nbsp;</p>

      <p>Kant's output was large but he produced his most important
works,
the three <i>Critiques</i>, late in life. His attempts to establish an
objective basis for aesthetic judgments have influenced later art
criticism. In <i>Critique of Judgment </i>he argued that aesthetic
judgments do not depend on any property&nbsp;&#8211; such as beauty&nbsp;&#8211; of
the object. Kant's famous contribution to moral philosophy is the
principle<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"act only on that maxim through
which you can at the same time will that it should to become a
universal law."
      </p>
      <p>In <i>The Critique of Pure Reason </i>Kant wanted to prove,
that although our knowledge is derived from experience, it is possible
to have knowledge of objects in advance of experience. The key question
is how are synthetic <i>a priori </i>judgments possible? An <i>a
priori</i> knowledge is knowledge which is independent of all
experience. <i>A priori</i> proposition is one that can be known to be
true, or false, without reference to experience, except so far as
experience is necessary for understanding its terms.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>An analytic truth can be deduced from the definition of its
terms, and a synthetic truth cannot be so deduced. Such propositions as
'All bodies are extended in space' or 'All husbands are male' are
analytical, because the ideas of extension and maleness are already
contained in those of 'body' and 'male.' Analytical propositions are
not dependent on experience for their validations; if true they are
necessary true <i>a priori</i>. On the other hand, 'Some bodies are
heavy' is synthetic, since the idea of heaviness is not necessarily
contained in the subject idea. Synthetic propositions are always
contingent; any such proposition is capable of being true or false. Its
truth could be known only <i>a posteriori</i>, after it had received
validation from experience. An <i>a posteriori</i> knowledge is
derived from experience. <i>A posteriori </i>
preposition can be known to be true, or false, only by reference to
how, as a matter of contingent fact, things have been, are, or will be.
'Every change has a cause,' expresses a judgment which is strictly
necessary and universal. 'All bodies are heavy' is simply a
generalization to which no exception have been observed.</p>
      <p>Accoding to Hume, all significant propositions must be either
(i) synthetic and <i>a posteriori</i> or (ii) analytic and <i>a
priori.</i> But Kant stated that there is a third category, namely
synthetic <i>a priori</i>. Kant firmly believed in an independent
reality outside the world of all possible experience, calling this the
world of the <em>noumenal</em>, the world of things as they are in
themselves, and of reality as it is in itself. A Kantian synonym for <em>noumenon</em>
is <em>Ding an Sich</em>. The world of <em>phenomena</em> is the
world of things as they appears to us&nbsp;&#8211; the directly known world
of actual experience. <br>
</p>
      <p>Noumena are delimeted since they cannot be known. Thus
he developed three cognitive faculties, imagination, understanding, and
reason, and through their relationships he examined "the science of
relation of all knowledge to the essential ends of human reason."
Kant&nbsp; suggested, that the way in which we
perceive, identify, and reflect upon objects might have itself a form
or structure which in some ways moulds or contributes to our experience.</p>
      <p>According to Kant, all that our senses and understanding
contribute to knowledge is preconditioned by the 'forms of our
sensibility' (space and time) and by the 'categories of our
understanding' that are not learned from experience, but enable us to
make sense of our experience. Among the twelve categories&nbsp;are
space, time, quantity, quality, relation, modality, and their subforms.
They are essential if any creature is going to be able to make
judgments about his experience. Together they form a sort of minimum
conceptual apparatus for making sense of the world. What<em> </em>we
experience can come to us wholly and solely in terms of the <em>a
priori</em> framework. We don't synthesize reality, make it up, it
exists independently of us. Because reality exists independently of all
possible experience it remains permanently hidden. </p>
      <p>Thus Kant's conclusion was, that cognition is restricted to
the realm of phenomena, meaning appearances. We can know nothing which
cannot be given through our senses. Within these limitations we may
have valid empirical knowledge, and a cognition <i>a priori</i> of the
universal conditions which make nature itself and a science of nature
possible. Kant believed that Newton had proved beyond any possibility
of doubt, that what happens within this world is governed entirely by
scientific laws. But without experience there can be no empirical
world. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"What we have meant to say is
that all our intuition is nothing but the representation of appearance;
that the things which we intuit are not in themselves what we intuit
them as being, nor their relations so constituted in themselves as they
appear to us, and that if the subject, or even only the subjective
constitution of the senses in general, be removed, the whole
constitution and all the relations of objects in space and time, nay
space and time themselves, would vanish. As appearances, they cannot
exists in themselves, but only in us. What objects may be in
themselves, and apart from all this receptivity of our sensibility,
remains completely unknown to us. We know nothing but our mode of
perceiving them&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> a mode which is peculiar to us,
and not necessarily shared in by every being, though, certainly, by
every human being. With this alone have we any concern." </strong>(from
        <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>)
        </font></blockquote>
      <p>Especially
Kant's philosophy of religion arose strong
reaction, but the younger generation saw Kant as their intellectual
leader. After receiving a letter in 1794, signed by the King, in which
he was reproached for having "misused" his philosophy for the
distortion of basic teachings of Holy Scripture and of Christianity, he
did not discuss religious matters in public again. <br>
</p>
      <p>Jena soon became the center of Kantian idealism, with such
representatives as Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller, Johann
Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, and Georg
Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. In <i>The World as Will and Representation </i>Schopenhauer
wrote: "Kant's teaching produces a fundamental change in every mind
that has grasped it. This change is so great that it may be regarded as
an intellectual rebirth. It alone is capable of really moving the
inborn realism which arises from the original disposition of the
intellect... In consequence of this, the mind undergoes a fundamental
undeceiving, and thereafter looks at things in another light." From
Schopenhauer Kant's influence continued to Nietzsche and through him to
modern existentialism; another line of succession went to Wittgenstein
and through him to modern analytic philosophy. Third line goes to
science-based rationalism and Popper, who once remarked: "It was
through Schopenhauer that I understood Kant." </p>
