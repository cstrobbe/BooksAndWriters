      <p>Polish dramatist, prose writer, and cartoonist, whose works
explore alienation, abuse of power, conformity, and the limitations of
human freedom under a totalitarian system. Mro&#380;ek often uses
surrealistic humor and grotesque situations to reveal the distorted
beliefs of his characters. His most famous plays include <i>Tango</i>
(1964), a multileveled family saga, and <i>Emigranci </i>(1974),
about the collapse of illusions. After spending 33 years abroad, Mro&#380;ek
returned to Poland in 1997. </p>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial" size="2">ARTHUR (</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2">jumps up and runs across the stage</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">): But it's not only Grandfather. I was born

can't breathe, you can't live!"</font><font size="2"> </font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Tango</font></i><font size="2">,
1964) </font></blockquote>
      <p>S&#322;awomir Mro&#380;ek was born in Borzecin, near Cracow, the son of
Antoni Mro&#380;ek, a village postmaster, and Zofia (Kedzior) Mro&#380;ek; she
died in 1949. His early years&nbsp;Mrozek spent in the villages of
Borzecin and Porabka Uszewska and in Cracow. Though&nbsp;he received a
conventional Catholic education, religious issues have not been in the
forefront in his plays. More important for his development were the war
years, the Nazi occupation of Poland, the establishment of a "people's
republic" after the war, and the Stalinist repression, which created a
whole generation of disillusioned young people. </p>
      <p>Mro&#380;ek graduated&nbsp;from the Nowodworski Lycée in
1949,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;started&nbsp;to study architecture. After
three months, he dropped out, and entered the Academy of Fine Arts in
Cracow, but again abandoned the curriculum because he was "bored" and
joined the staff of <i>Dziennik Polski</i>. For a short time he
studied also Oriental philosophy at the University of Cracow, to avoid
being drafted in the army<b>.</b> His early journalistic pieces were in
tune with the official ideology. "We trust the Great Stalin, trust the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Why should we be not certain of
the future," he wrote in 1952,&nbsp;but a year later when his love for
Stalin began to wane, he stated: "Jazz can help solve the problem of
youthful boredom. . . . "&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Opowiadania z Trzmielowej Gory</em> (1953, Tales from
Bumble Bee Hill) Mro&#380;ek's first published book containing two satirical
stories, was printed in an edition of 25,000 copies. The second volume,<em>
Polpancerze praktyczne</em> (Practical Half-Armour)&nbsp;also appeared
in 1953. Mro&#380;ek attaced petit bourgeois mentality, warned about the
revival of fascist tendencies in Germany, and introduced&nbsp; Dwight
D. Eisenhower as a continuator of Hitler's tradition. </p>
      <p>In 1956 Mro&#380;ek traveled to the Soviet Union and in 1957 he
spent two months in France. Mrozek's satirical drawings started to
appear regularly in the humor magazine <i>Przekrój</i> and in <i>Szpilki</i>,
and in 1958 he began editing a weekly, <i>Postepowiec</i>. In 1959
Mro&#380;ek married the artist Maria Oremba; she died of cancer in 1969 in
West Berlin. </p>
      <p>For a while Mro&#380;ek was better known for his cartoons than for
his fiction. "In any case, drawing for me was the school in which I
learned to write," he once said. His talent for playwrighting Mro&#380;ek
discovered when he wrote a show, <i>Joy in Earnest</i>, for the
student theatre Bim-Bom. His first play, <i>Policja</i> (1958, The
Police), presented the old story of the fox and the geese in a new form
      <b><font face="Symbol">-</font> </b>an highly efficient police
force, that has suppressed all disloyalty to the government,&nbsp;must
manufacture fake political dissenters to secure the existence of the
system. During this period student and cabaret theatres began to
develop in Poland, Andrzej Wajda made his early films (<i>Kanal</i> in
1957 and <i>Ashes and Diamonds</i> in 1958), <a href="slem.htm">Stanislaw
Lem</a> published his early science-fiction stories, and Witold
Lutoslawski made his international breakthrough with <i>Funeral music
in memoriam Béla Barók</i> (1958), in which he used 12-tone techniques.
      </p>
      <p>The most important playwrights at that time, Mro&#380;ek
and Tadeusz Rozewicz, introduced fresh ideas in the Polish theatre,
especially from the repertoire of the absurd. Liberalization of the
system did not last long. Following serious strikes and riots over food
shortages and Soviet "exploitation," Wladyslaw Gomulka assumed power
and began limited Stalinization. In October 1957 the journal <i>Po
prostu</i> was closed down and the workers 'councils were dissolved. </p>
      <p>Mro&#380;ek established his international reputation with his early
short story collections. S&#322;o&#324; (1957, The Elephant), in
which the themes were not tied down to Polish conditions too
demonstratively, became a bestseller and received the prestigious award
of the literary review <i>Przeglad kulturanly</i>. It was followed by <i>Wesele
w Atomicach</i> (1959, Wedding in Atomville) and <i>Deszcz</i> (1962,
Rain). Almost all volumes of his short stories and plays were usually
sold out instantly.</p>
      <p>Mro&#380;ek's short fiction satirize the Polish mentality, romantic
heroism and grandiloquence, or the oddities of the Communist system,
but his main target is the human behavior, human follies. In 'The
Elephant' Mro&#380;ek parodied didactic tales. The director of the
Zoological Gardens wants to reduce the costs of the establishment. He
orders an elephant made out of rubber. Unluckily, it is filled with
gas. Next morning children from a school visit the zoo. The teacher
tells that "the weight of a fully grown elephant is between nine and
thirteen thousand pounds." A gust of wind blows the elephant away. As a
result, children start to neglect their studies. The story ends with a
sad note: "And they no longer believe in elephants." </p>
      <p>Mro&#380;ek traveled in France, England, Italy, Yugoslavia, and
other European countries. As a cartoonist, Mrozek enjoyed a huge
popularity, and his plays were performed in London, New York, and
Paris. In the West, Mro&#380;ek's fame spread also through Martin Esslin's
book <i>The Theatre of the Absurd</i>, which appeared first in the
early 1960s. Esslin's ground-breaking study labelled Mro&#380;ek as an
absurdist for the following decades. Mro&#380;ek himself has later resisted
the etiquette, saying that his plays do not fit exactly into the
category. Esslin coined the concept of "the Theatre of the Absurd" to
describe a group of European non-naturalistic playwrights, who
dramatized the strange, meaningless nature of life, which has no
certainties or purpose. According to Esslin, "the decline of religious
beliefs has deprived man of certainties. When it is no longer possible
to accept complete closed systems of values and revelations of divine
purpose, life must be faced as in its ultimate, stark reality." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The Theatre of the Absurd</font></i><font size="2">, 1961, 3rd edn, 1980)</font></p>
      <p><i>The Police</i>, one of Mro&#380;ek's most acclaimed early
works,&nbsp;was broadcast&nbsp;on television in the United States and
was also produced at the Phoenix Theatre, New York, in 1961. <i>Na
pelnym morzu</i> (1961, Out at Sea), <i>Karol</i> (1961, Charlie), and
      <i>Strip-Tease </i>(1961, Eng. tr. 1972) all one-act plays,
dealt with relationship between the experience of an individual and
impersonal, corrupted common good. Although written under a
totalitarian regime, the works move beyond a particular national
culture and strive for a blend of various literary tradition, beyond
the concept of socialist realism. During this period, Mro&#380;ek's art was
undergoing changes. "I, alone with myself; I and another human being; I
and society; I and the metaphysical," Mrozek wrote in a letter. "Four
basic relations, four dimensions of my being." </p>
      <p>Already in his early dramas, Mro&#380;ek avoided explicit political
or historical allusions, but his Orwellian criticism of a modern
totalitarian state did not go unnoticed by his public or the censors.
Referring to the history of his country, Mro&#380;ek once said: "The monster
kept me imprisoned, but it fascinated me a lot at the same time."
Mro&#380;ek
left Poland in 1963. He lived with his wife in self-imposed
exile in Italy until 1968 and moved then to Paris.&nbsp;Two of Mro&#380;ek's
plays were seen in London in 1964 during the first World Theatre
Season. </p>
      <p>Mro&#380;ek's first full-length play, <i>Tango</i>, is perhaps
still his most famous work. It was first performed at the Jugoslovensko
Dramsko Pozoriske in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on April 21, 1965. In Poland
it was produced by the director Erwin Axer at the Teatr Wspolozesny.
Tom Stoppard's adaptation was first performed by the Royal Shakespeare
Company in 1966. (Stoppard also revised the literal translation of the
play with the assistance of a native Polish speaker.) The first
performance in New York took place at the Pocket Theater in 1969. On
one level, <i>Tango</i> is a tale about the conflict between
generations, but basically it demonstrates the process, in which
youthful idealism turns into unscrupulous struggle for power and paves
way to despotism. Martin Esslin has argued, that the original Polish
audience in Warsaw would have seen the work as a bitter and sardonic
comment on Stalinism. "I am going to create a system in which rebellion
will be combined with order, nonbeing with being," declares the young
idealist, Arthur. "I will transcend all contradictions." "He meant
well, but he was too highstrung," says Eddie after killing Arthur. "His
kind never gets old." At the end, the old generation, Uncle Eugene, and
opportunism, Eddie, dance together the popular tango, 'La Cumparsita',
over the corpse of old traditions. "I've got the feeling, Arthur, my
boy, that nobody needs you anymore," says Eugene. </p>
      <p>After Mro&#380;ek denounced his country's part in the 1968 invasion
of Czechoslovakia in <i>Le Monde</i>, he was immediately called home.
However, Mrozek accepted his "homeless" state, his position as an
outsider, and decided to stay in Paris. Authorities in Poland responded
by banning his plays and stories for some time, and his books were
withdrawn from libraries. In the early 1970s, Mro&#380;ek traveled in the
United States and South America. In 1978 he became a French citizen.
His own experiences in exile Mro&#380;ek dramatized <i>Emigranci</i> (1974,
The Emigrants), in which two refugees from Eastern Europe, who have
little in common, lose even their own individual dreams. A ban on his
writings was gradually lifted and his plays <em>Szczesliwe wydarzenie</em>
(1971, A Happy Event) and <em>Rzeznia</em> (1973, Slaughterhouse) were
published in Poland. </p>
      <p>When Wojciek Jaruzelski proclaimed martial law in 1981 and
arrested Solidarity leaders, Mro&#380;ek protested in <i>Le Monde</i>, and
forbade television performances of his plays and publication of his
writings in Polish papers. However, his works were still performed in
Polish theaters, although authorities banned <i>Ambasador </i>(1982),
which had its world premiere in Warsaw just before martial law was
declared. With several other writers, such as Czeslaw Milosz and Leszek
Kolakowski, Mrozek protested in 1983 against the dissolution of the
Polish Writers' Association (ZLP). </p>
      <p>Mro&#380;ek married in 1987 the Mexican theatre director Orario
Rosas. He received the Franz Kafka award<b>, </b>but refused
to accept the Polish Fundacja Literacka award<b>. </b>In 1989 the
Mro&#380;eks moved to Mexico, settling on a ranch called<b> </b>La Epifania<b>.</b>
There Mrozek composed the first part of his diary, <i>Dziennik powrotu</i>,
which he later finished in Poland.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Mi&#322;o&#347;&#263; na Krymie</span><i> </i>(1993,
Love in the Crimean) focused the fall of the Russian empire. Mrozek
wrote it in French for a competition for the best play by a French
playwright, and received Crédit Industriel et Commercial Paris Théâtre
award for staging the play in the Théâtre de la Colline in Paris. <i>Piekni
widok </i>(1998, The Beautiful Sight) was about two European tourists,
whose vacation is ruined by the Balkan War. </p>
      <p>In 1990, a festival dedicated to Mro&#380;ek was arranged in
Cracow. The ancient city-hall tower in the middle of the main square
was wrapped in Mrozek's trademark <font face="Symbol">-</font> a large
natty tie. In 1994 Noir sur Blanc
started to publish his works in Polish. Mrozek moved with Orario Rosas
to Cracow in 1997. His 70 years birthday was widely celebrated in
Cracow and Borzecin. From the late 1990s, his cartoons and columns have
appeared in the largest daily newspaper, <i>Gazeta Wyborcza</i>. In
2003, Mro&#380;ek received the highest French national distinction,
Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur. </p>
