      <p>Polish philosopher who began as an orthodox Marxist but
greatly contributed to the emergence of a Marxist humanism in the 1950s
and 1960s. Kolakowski was closely involved in the movement towards
liberation that led, in 1956, to the Polish spring. He was dismissed
from the Communist Party and in 1968 he moved to the West, where he
published works on the history of religion and philosophy. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A modern philosopher who has never
once suspected himself of being a charlatan must be such a shallow mind
that his work is probably not worth reading."</b> (from </font><font size="2"><i>Metaphysical Horror</i>, 1988) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Leszek Ko&#322;akowski was born in Radom, the son of Jerzy Ko&#322;akowski , a publicist, and the former Lucyna Pietrusiewicz. During
the German occupation of Poland in World War II, Ko&#322;akowski  studied in
the underground school system. Much of his time he spent at the family
country house, reading books from its library. His father was killed by the Gestapo. <br>
</p>
      <p>After the war, Ko&#322;akowski  joined the Communist youth organization (ZMP). He studied
philosophy at the University of Lódz, receiving his Ph.D. in 1953 from
Warsaw University. From 1947 to 1949 he was Assistant in Logic at
University of Lodz, and from 1950 to 1959 he worked as an assistant and
then a docent at University of Warsaw. In 1949 he married Tamara
Dynenson, a psychiatrist; they had a one daughter. </p>

      <p>Ko&#322;akowski joined in 1945 the Polish Workers's Party and
taught at its school in 1952-54. He was a member of the editorial board
of the weekly <i>Nowa Kultura</i>, and in 1955 he became a staff
member of <i>Po Prostu</i>, a weekly run by young Communist
intellectuals. A visit to Moscow opened his eyes to the emptiness of the Stalinist<em></em> system.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>After the new constitution was accepted in 1952 in Poland,
Stalinist repression tightened its grip. Along with the so-called
"October thaw" in 1956, Ko&#322;akowski 
became one of the leading voices for
the democratization of life in Poland. Workers' protests were crushed,
the reformist W&#322;adys&#322;aw Gomulka assumed power, but the basic political system did not
change, although he eased some restrictions of cultural policies.
Gomulka's reign ended in 1970. </p>
      <p>In the late 1950s poets, novelist, and playwrights undertook
innovative experiments and searched new forms of expression. Ko&#322;akowski's essay 'The Priest and the Jester' (1959), in which he
confronted dogmaticism with skepticism and took the side of the Jester,
made him the most prominent Marxist philosopher in Poland. Under the
influence of Kant and Sartre, and the thoughts of the young Marx and
his theory of alienation, Ko&#322;akowski  moved towards Marxist humanism. He
criticized some basic Marxist doctrines, among them belief in
deterministic historical progress; history, according to Ko&#322;akowski, mercilessly mocked theory. Due his views, Ko&#322;akowski  was
labelled as revisionist. In his collection of essays, <i>Towards a
Marxist Humanism</i> (1970), he affirmed the moral responsibility of
the individual and rejected determinism. Ko&#322;akowski's major work in
Marxist thought, <i>Main Currents in Marxism</i> (1978), published in
three volumes, traced the origins of the movement from Plotinus to the
1970s and Mao Zedong. In the third volume he wrote: "At present Marxism
neither interprets the world nor changes it: it is merely a repertoire
of slogans serving to organize various interests..." </p>
      <p>Ko&#322;akowski&nbsp; was head of the section of the history of modern
philosophy at the University of Warsaw from 1959 to 1968 and professor
of modern philosophy from 1964 until 1968. In 1966 he delivered a
speech at the 10th anniversary of the "Polish October" and was expelled
from the Polish Workers' Party. Two years later he was dismissed from
his chair at the university for "forming views of the youth in a manner
contrary to the official tendency of the country." <span style="font-style: italic;">Obecno&#347;&#263; mitu </span>(The Presence of Myth),
was set up in type in Warsaw, then banned, and eventually
published in Polish in France in 1972 by Institute Littéraire, and in
German translation by Piper Verlag. With his Jewish wife Ko&#322;akowski
left Poland in 1968
during the extreme nationalist campaign against "Zionists". No
references to his work could be made in Poland in twenty years. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the
1980s Ko&#322;akowski supported Solidarity giving interviews, writing, and
collecting money. His writing, which had circulated in<em></em>
underground publications, had contributed to the formation of dissident
groups, which eventually spread and evolved into the Solidarity movement.
Officially he was a persona non grata until the fall of Communism in
Poland. Analyzing the situation of exiles he once said, "More often
than not,
modern exiles have been expatriates, rather than exiles in the strict
sense;&nbsp; usually they were not physically deported from their
countries
or banished by law; they escaped from political persecution, prison,
death, or simply censorship." </p>

      <p>Ko&#322;akowski&nbsp; was Professor of philosophy at McGill University
and in 1969 he taught at University of California, Berkeley. Since the
1970s was a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, visiting professor at
Yale University, New Haven Connecticut. From 1981 to 1994 he served as
Professor on the Committee of Social Thought and the Development of
Philosophy at the University of Chicago. In 1983 he became Fellow of
the British Academy. He was also a fellow of the Académie Universelle
des Cultures, and a Foreign Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences. </p>
      <p>Already in his early writing Ko&#322;akowski  dealt with religion,
but especially his later work was concerned with issues in ethics and
metaphysics. In <i>Religion</i> (1982) he critically analyzed a wide
range of arguments for and against the existence of God. <i>God Owes
Us Nothing: A Brief Remark on Pascal's Religion and on the Spirit of
Jansenism</i> (1998) explored Christian notions of grace and sin, and
asked the basic question <font face="Symbol">-</font> how can a good,
omnipotent God permit evil? Ko&#322;akowski also published plays, stories,
and fables. <i>Tales from the Kingdom of Lailonia </i>(1963) was
build around the opposition of faith and reality. <i>Rozmowy z diablem</i>
(1965), his second collection of tales, was published in America as <i>Conversations
with the Devil</i>. </p>
      <p>Both in writings about Marxism and religion Ko&#322;akowski  showed
similar deep understanding of doctrinal questions, often focusing on
the conflict between heterodoxy and orthodoxy. Dialectical materialism
he looked from the perspective of Christian philosophical theology as a
"modern variant of apocalyptic expectations". The Marxian dream of a
perfect social system Kolakowski paralleled with the old utopian
religious movements. "... there is no reason to expect that this dream
can ever become true except in the cruel from of despotism," he has
said. The truth of Christianity and Socialism <font face="Symbol">-</font>
social justice, fight against social oppression <font face="Symbol">-</font>
are both one-sided. <br>
</p>
      <p>As a response to E.P. Thompson's 'An Open Letter to
Leszek Ko&#322;akowski', published in <i>The Socialist Register</i> in
1973, Ko&#322;akowski explained
why he considered Communism a "poor idea",
not worth of saving from its shortcomings. However, a year later he
stated that socialist societies do not need a return to capitalism. In
1975Ko&#322;akowski
signed&nbsp; the 'Letter of the Fifty-nine,' protesting projected
amendments to the Polish constitution that would have formalized the
leading rle of the Party. <br>
 </p>

      <p>Ko&#322;akowski&nbsp; did not believe that there is a perfect solution to
all human problems, but the search for fundamental truths beyond
question is a part of European culture. Marxism, Ko&#322;akowski seemed to
claim, sprang from the same source as Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein,
or The Modern Prometheus</i>. In <i>God Owes Us Nothing</i> (1995) the
names of Jansenius, Augustine, and Saint Paul could be easily be
replaced by some names familiar from the history of Marxist philosophy
(Hegel, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Lev Trotsky, Rosa Luxemburg):
"Jansenius's followers called themselves disciplines of Augustine,
whose authority had been unshakable in Christianity. They insisted that
they &#8211; and their master, Jansenius &#8211; had nothing new to say; they
simply followed and repeated the most traditional teaching of the
Church, which conformed to the Gospels and to the epistles of Saint
Paul and was codified in Augustinian theology." </p>
      <p>Ko&#322;akowski
received several awards, including the German
Booksellers Peace Prize (1977), Erasmus Prize (1980), Veillon
Foundation European Prize for the Essay (1980), Jefferson Award (1986),
MacArthur Award (1982), University of Chicago Laing Award (1990),
Tocqueville Prize (1994). He also received the White Eagle, Poland&#8217;s
highest honor. In 2003 the Library of Congress awarded him the $1
million Kluge Prize for lifetime contribution to the humanities.
Ko&#322;akowski died in July 2009, in Oxford, England, at the age of 81.</p>
