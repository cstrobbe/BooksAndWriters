<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French philosopher who was awarded
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927. Bergson argued that the
intuition is deeper than the intellect. His <i>Creative Evolution</i> (1907) and <i>Matter and Memory</i>
(1896) attempted to integrate the findings of biological science with a
theory of consciousness. Bergson's work was considered the main
challenge to the mechanistic view of nature. He is sometimes claimed to
have anticipated features of relativity theory and modern scientific
theories of the mind. Bertrand Russell, one of the most authoritative
opponents of Bergson, did not consider him a philosopher at all, but
merely a mediocre poet. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In reality, the past is preserved by
itself automatically. In its entirety, probably, it follows us at every
instant; all that we have felt, thought and willed from our earliest
infancy is there, leaning over the present which is about to join it,
pressing against the portals of consciousness that would fain leave it
outside."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Creative Evolution</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>


<p>Henri Bergson was born in Paris, the son of Michel, a prosperous
musician from Poland and Katherine Levinson, a woman of Anglo-Irish
descent; both were Jewish. Part of his childhood Bergson spent in
London, learning English so well that in later life he checked the
English translations of his books. When Bergson was eight, the family
returned to France. </p><p>While still at the Lycée Concordet (then
the Fontane), Bergson won an open prize for an original solution to a
mathematical problem, which was in published in <i>Annales de Mathematiques</i>
in 1878. Bergson studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and after
earning his degree in 1881, he spent the following years as a teacher
in a succession of <i>lycées</i>. One of his pupils was the journalist Charles Péguy, who established the journal <i>Cahiers de la quinzaine</i>. </p><p>In
1900 Bergson became a professor at the Collège de France. His lectures
were highly popular, drawing students, academics, general public and
tourists; students referred to the collège as "the house of Bergson."
In 1913 he traveled&nbsp;to the United States, where&nbsp;occasioned
one of New York City's first traffic jams. From 1914 until 1921 Édouard
Le Roy functioned as Bergson's "permanent substitute" while the
philosopher served on French diplomatic missions. Bergson resigned in
1921 in order to dedicate himself to his writing and to his work on
behalf of the League of Nations. From 1921 to 1926 he acted as
president of the committee on international cooperation of the League
of Nations. </p>
<p>Bergson enjoyed the status of a cult figure in the years between
World Wars. Although not a practicing Jew, Bergson refused the Vichy
government's offers to excuse him from the scope of their anti-Semitic
laws. He decided to join the persecuted and registered himself at the
end of 1940 as a Jew. However, his religious thinking had brought him
closer to Catholicism. Bergson died of bronchitis on January 3, 1941.
For the last seventeen years of his life he had suffered from crippling
arthritis. The popularity of Bergson's philosophy faded in the 1920s.
Gilles Deleuze's study <em>Le bergsonisme</em> (1966), re-introduced
Bergson to contemporary philosophy and analyzed Bergsonian intuition as
a fundamental method of his philosophy. </p>

<p>"There is nothing in philosophy which could not be said in everyday
language," Bergson told once in an interview. In spite of his good
intentions, his ideas were often high-flown and difficult to follow. In
his first major work,<i> <i></i>Time and Free Will </i>(1889), Bergson
aimed to show how pseudoproblems about the will and its freedom have
arisen from a false phenomenology of mental states &#8211; essentially, a
tendency to conceive and describe them in spatial terms. Human
experience does not perceive real life as a succession of demarcated
conscious states, progressing along some imaginary line, but rather a
continuous flow. Bergson made the distinction between the concept and
experience of time. While the physicist observes objects and events in
succession, time is presented to consciousness as <i>duration</i> &#8211; an
endlessly flowing process, which resists simple mathematization.
Bergson argued that the 'real time' is experienced as duration and
apprehended by intuition, not through separate operations of instinct
and the intellect. </p>
<p>In <i>An Introduction to Metaphysics</i> (1903) Bergson saw that the
intuition, the direct apprehension of process, as the discoverer of
truth &#8211; intuition, not analysis, reveals the real world. Sometimes
intuition in Bergson referred to getting bright ideas, sometimes it was
the method of philosophy like intellect is of mathematics. His concept
of <i>élan vital</i>, "creative impulse" or "living energy", was developed in <i>Creative Evolution</i>, his most famous book. <i>Élan vital</i>
is an immaterial force, whose existence cannot be scientifically
verified, but it provides the vital impulse that continuously shapes
all life. Bergson questioned the Darwinist theories that evolution
occurs in great leaps or alternatively through the gradual accumulation
of slight mutations and explained by <i>élan vital</i> the creative course of evolution. </p>
<p>In 1914 all of Bergson's writings, but most especially <i>Creative Evolution</i>,
were placed upon the list of books devout Catholics were forbidden to
read. After its appearance twenty-five years elapsed before Bergson
published another major work, <i>The Two Sources of Morality and Religion </i>(1932),
his final statement of his philosophy which also reflected the threats
of nationalist-racist politics and hinted at the coming of mechanized
warfare. <i>The Creative Mind</i>, published two years later, was a collection of essays and other writings. </p>
<p>"In laughter we always find an unavowed intention to humiliate and consequently to correct our neighbour," Bergson stated in <i>Laughter</i> (1900). It is not among Bergson's best-known studies, but <a href="koestler.htm">Arthur Koestler</a> considered it as important for his book <i>The Act of Creation</i> as (1964) Freud's classic <i>Wit and its Relations to the Unconscious</i>.
Bergson defined the comic as the result of the sense of relief we feel
when we feel ourselves from the mechanistic and materialistic&nbsp;&#8211;
his examples were the man-automaton, the puppet on strings, Jack-in-the
Box, etc. "A situation is always comic", he wrote, "if it participates
simultaneously in two series of events which are absolutely independent
of each other, and if it can be interpreted in two quite different
meanings." He saw laughter as the corrective punishment inflicted by
society upon the unsocial individual. "It seems that laughter needs an
echo. Our laughter is always the laughter of a group." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>Bergson had been interested in Spencerian evolutionism in his youth,
but he later abandoned Spencer's view placing intuition as the highest
human faculty. In <i>Creative Evolution</i> Bergson argued that the
creative urge, not the Darwinian concept of natural selection, is at
the heart of evolution. Man's intellect has developed in the course of
evolution as an instrument of survival. It comes to think inevitably in
geometrical or 'spatializing' terms that are inadequate to lay hold of
the ultimate living process. But intuition goes to the heart of
reality, and enables us to find philosophic truth.</p>
<p>Bergson's thinking and concept of time has influenced greatly <a href="hauser.htm">Arnold Hauser</a>, <a href="csimon.htm">Claude Simon</a>,
William James, Alfred North Whitehead, Santayana, and such authors as
Péguy, Valéry, and John Dos Passos. Whitehead expanded Bergson's
notions of duration and evolution from their applications to organic
life into the phycial realm. It is said that for <a href="proust.htm">Marcel Proust</a>,
whose cousin Louise Neuberger&nbsp;the philosopher&nbsp;married in
1891,&nbsp;he gave the idea for the great novel of reminiscence, <i>À la recherche de temps perdu</i>
(1913-27). Proust attended Bergson's lectures given at the Sorbonne
from 1891 to 1893. However, there is only one recorded conversation
between Proust and Bergson&nbsp;&#8211; the subject was the nature of sleep.
Proust brought Bergson an excellent box of earplugs. Sartre also paid
tribute to Bergson, and Martin Heidegger, whose ontology is echoed in
existentialist writing, used some of Bergson's concepts, such as
"no-being."</p><p>Despite his fame, Bergson never produced a movement.
His influence on existentialism is not straight forward and in his own
time the philosopher was considered an empiricist. On the other hand,
Bergson's argumentation frustrated such philosophers as the empiricist
Bertrand Russell, who criticized his thoughts in 1914 and later
returned to them in <i>History of Western Philosophy. </i>Philosophers
have pointed out that Bergson did not satisfactorily show how intuition
could work apart from intellect. Russell argued in his&nbsp;analysis of
the doctrine of intuition that "instinct is seen at its best in ants,
bees, and Bergson." </p><p>Albert Einstein found serious mistakes from Bergson's <em>Durée et simultanéité. À propos de la théorie d'Einstein</em>
(1921), dealing with Einstein's theory of relativity, which Bergson
subsequently tried to withdraw from circulation. He had opposed in 1911
Einstein's ideas, but then his view had changed and he introduced the
concept of non-linear time. Some of the leading physicists have devoted
articles to his work. Nevertheless, Bergson was accused of rejecting
the new physics of relativity because he had not understood it. Bergson
retreated from public view and devoted himself to his final work, <em>The Two Sources of Morality and Religion</em>.</p>
