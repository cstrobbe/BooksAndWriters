<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->French-born novelist, passionate eroticist
and short story writer,
who gained international fame with her journals. Spanning the years
from 1931 to 1974, they give an account of one woman's voyage of
self-discovery. "It's all right for a woman to be, above all, human. I
am a woman first of all." (<font size="2">from </font><i><font size="2">The Diary of Anaïs Nin</font></i><font size="2">, vol. I, 1966) </font>Anaïs
Nin was largely ignored until the 1960s. Today she is regarded as one
of the leading women writers of the 20th-century and a source of
inspiration for women challenging conventionally defined gender roles<b>. </b></p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2"><b>"I had expected a man for the
demonstration of sixty-six ways of making love. Henry barters over the
price. The women smile. The big one has bold features, raven black hair
in curls which almost hide her face. The smaller one has a pale face
with blonde hair. They are like mother and daughter. They wear
high-heeled shoes, black stockings with garters at the thighs, and
loose open kimono. They lead us upstairs. They walk ahead, swinging
their hips."</b></font></b><font size="2"> </font><font size="2">(from <i>Journals 1931-1934</i>) </font><b><font size="2"></font></b></blockquote>

<p>Anaïs Nin was born in Neuilly, France, to artistic parents. 
After a cosmopolitan childhood in Europe, Nin came to the   New 
York City with her French-Danish mother, Rosa Culmell Nin, and two 
brothers in 1914. Rosa Culmell was a classical singer and society woman. "She only had 
one love in all her life, my father," Nin wrote in her diary. Nin's 
father,  the Cuban-born composer-pianist 
Joaquín Nin, had deserted the family when Anaïs was 11.  
According to Nin's memories her father fondled her and he 
liked to take photos of her while she bathed. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Incest: from"A Journal of Love"</span> (1992) 
she tells of her lovemaking with her father, after his absence of 20 years. However, 
Nin often combined truth and fiction, and many of the details 
surrounding her life are part of her myth, especially those published in her 
unexpurgated diaries. In one of her other books, 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Winter of Artifice</span> (1939), Nin also wrote about daughter's relationship 
to her father. </p>
<p> Largely self-educated, Nin spent her youth reading in public 
libraries and keeping a journal. She initially wrote in French and 
did not begin to write in English until she was seventeen. The diary was 
her confidante, or as she said in an interview, it was her hashish, her 
opium pipe, serving as a retreat from the world. In New York 
Nin studied art, and  married in 1923 the banker and artist Hugh Guiler. 
Later known also as an engraver and filmmaker, he illustrated  her books 
under the pseudonym Ian Hugo. When she began writing fiction, 
Nin moved in 1924 with Guiler  to Paris, France, where she   associated with 
the villa Seurat group. Especially important person in her life during this 
period was the American writer <a href="hmiller.htm">Henry Miller</a>, whom 
she met in 1932 and with whom she started a long-time affair. He and Nin both 
influenced each other in their work <font face="Symbol">-</font> their correspondence was 
published in 1987 as A <span style="font-style: italic;">Literary Passion</span>. With Otto Rank, also one of her lovers, Nin 
worked as a lay analyst. When the affair with Miller had cooled off, she accused him of 
reducing all women to "an aperture, a biological sameness". </p>
<p>Nin's literary career began with the publication 
of <span style="font-style: italic;">D.H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study</span> (1932). She wrote it in 16 days. Because it was not sold in the United States, Nin 
sent copies to Frances Steloff, who ran the Gotham Book Mark in New York City, 
and told her to sell them for a dollar a piece. 

This work was followed by several 
books, including  <span style="font-style: italic;">House of Incest </span>(1936), a prose poem dealing with psychological 
torments concerning her relationship with Miller and his wife, June Mansfield. </p>
<p>Nin's short prose pieces appeared in such journals as <i>Dyn</i>, 
<i>The Booster</i>, and <i>Circle</i>. Her most famous story, 'Birth,' was originally published in the anthology <span style="font-style: italic;">Twice a Year</span> (1938), which she 
edited. Her early stories Nin collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Under a Glass Bell</span> (1944) and 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Waste of Timelessness</span> (1977). All of Nin's works have an erotic quality 
<font face="Symbol">- </font>"sensuality 
is a secret power in my body," she once said. In the early 1940s she wrote a series 
of specifically sexual pieces, which were edited and published posthumously as 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Delta of Venus</span> (1977) and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Little Birds</span> (1979). The stories in <i>Delta of Venus 
</i>Nin produced for a dollar a page in the 1940s. </p>

<p><i>Cities of the Interior</i>, Nin's famous series included&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>  <span style="font-style: italic;">Ladders to the Fire&nbsp;</span> (1946), <span style="font-style: italic;">Children of the Albatross</span> (1947), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Four-Chambered Heart&nbsp;</span> (1950), and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Spy in the House of Love</span> (1954). Nin focused on different female types and followed 
their lives through lovers, art, and analysis.  <i>Ladders to Fire </i>she 
first dedicated to <a href="vidal.htm">Gore Vidal</a>, because he got her published by E.P. Dutton 
when she was still unknown. From later editions the dedication was removed. 
"We are the two <i>nascissi</i> of the Forties," Vidal later said. In Vidal's 
Malibu house, Nin met Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, but soon dismissed her 
as a Southern Belle lacking in grace and charm. She was more interested in 
Newman, whom she regarded  just as much of a narcissist as she thought Gore Vidal
 was. </p>


<p>In the early 1940s, Nin returned to New York, where she set up the Gemor Press and 
published her books at her own expense. During her three-day visit at Black Mountain 
College in 1947, she encouraged also students to print their own work. Her close friend, 
James Leo Herlihy, said that she "brought to the school a kind of magical 
presence... very simple and straightforward, and open and mysterious 
all at once, and delicate." With the understanding Hugh Guiler, 
who  stayed out of the way of her extramarital affairs, Nin enjoyed a secure 
marriage for over 50 years.   Nin was also able to have in California a second husband, 
Rupert Pole. For at least 25 years, she commuted between  between New York and California. 

</p>
<p>In the 1940s and 1950s, she became allied with such young writers as Robert Duncan, Gore Vidal, 
and Jim Herlihy. Nin began to gain  fame in the 1960s with her diaries. They 
arouse also interest in her earlier publications, which she kept in print for the people who 
asked for them. 
Her diaries cover the years from 1931 to 1974, providing an insight into her development as a 
woman and artist. The first volume appeared when she was 63. Nin started the diary as a logbook 
when her family left Spain for America. More than a biographical document, 
the diary is a work of art. Each volume has an unifying theme. Individuals and scenes 
are vivid, conversations are presented in dialogue, lengthy observations are juxtaposed 
with cryptic comments. Henry Miller, who was first nervous about what she was writing 
about himself and June, ended up liking her analyses and urged to continue. Only 
<a href="rwest.htm">Rebecca West</a>
wanted to withdraw her portrait completely. "Although I wrote about her with great love, she 
just didn't like to be written in any way," Nin later said. </p>
<p>The feminist perspective of her works, 
psychological insight, and her search for self-knowledge 
made Nin a popular lecturer in the universities across the U.S. However, 
in <span style="font-style: italic;">A Woman Speaks</span> (1975), 
where Nin dissociated herself from the political activism of the feminist movement. 
She did not have faith in exchanges in systems, "because systems are corruptible", 
and advocated journal keeping as a preliminary requirement for a liberated self. "So I feel 
the great changes in the world will come from a great change in our consciousness," she wrote. 
The last volumes of the diaries  appeared posthumously in the 1980s. Nin died on January 14, 1977, 
in Los Angeles. "I only believe in fire. Life. Fire. Being myself on fire I set others on fire. 
Never death. Fire and life. Les Jeux." </p>
