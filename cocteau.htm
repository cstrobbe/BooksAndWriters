<p>French artist and writer, who made his name widely
known in poetry, fiction, film, ballet, painting, and opera. Jean
Cocteau's works reflect the influence of surrealism, psychoanalysis,
cubism, Catholic Religion; occasionally they were opium influenced. In
his time Cocteau was a promoter of avant-garde styles and fashions. His
friends included such prominent figures as Pablo Picasso, the composer
Erik Satie, the writer Marcel Proust, and the Russian director Serge
Diaghilev. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2"><b>"The worst tragedy for a poet is to be
admired through being misunderstood."</b> (from <i>Le Rappel à l'Ordre</i>,
1926) </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jean Cocteau was born in Maisons-Lafitte into a wealthy
Parisian family, which also was politically prominent. His
father,&nbsp;Georges,&nbsp;was a lawyer and amateur painter, who
committed suicide when Cocteau was nine. However, he had a lasting
influence on his son. It is said that this tragic event also created
Cocteau's awareness of human weakness, which he compensated by putting
himself in the service of the performing arts and the mysterious forces
in the universe. Poetry was for Cocteau the basis of all art, a
"religion without hope". </p>
<p>At the age of fifteen, Cocteau left home. He was in the
secondary school only a mediocre student, and unsuccessful after
repeated attempts to pass the graduation examination. At
the age of 19, Cocteau published huis first volume
of poems, <i>Aladdin's Lamp</i>. Soon he became known in the bohemian
artistic
circles as 'The Frivolous Prince' <font face="Symbol">-</font> the
title of a volume of poems he had published at twenty-one. The American
writer Edith Wharton described him as a man, "to whom every great line
of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly
City..." In his early twenties Coctreau became associated with Proust,
Gide, and Maurice Barrès. He was also a close friend of Victor Hugo's
great-grandson, Jean. </p>
<p>In 1915 Cocteau met Picasso and fell under his spell. "I
admired his intelligence, and clung to everything he said, for he spoke
little; I kept still so as not to miss a word. There were long silences
and Varèse could not understand why we stared wordlessly at each other.
In talking, Picasso used a visual syntax, and you could immediately <i>see
</i>what he was saying. He liked formulas and summoned himself up
in his statements as he summoned himself up and sculptured himself in
objects that he immediately made tangible." <font size="2">(from <i>Pablo
Picasso </i>by<i> </i>Pierre Cabanne, 1977) </font>Cocteau and the
poet Apollinaire were witnesses at Picasso's wedding to Olga. They held
gold crowns over the heads of the bride and groom as they circles three
times round the altar at the Russian Orthodox church in the rue Daru.
Cocteau's friendship with Picasso continued even after the artist
remarked in an interview: "He is not a poet... Jean is only a
journalist." Picasso also used to say, "Cocteau is the tail of my
comet". </p>
<p>The Russian ballet-master Sergei Diaghilev challenged Cocteau
to write for the ballet<font face="Symbol"> -</font> "Surprise me," he
urged. This resulted <i>Parade</i> (1917), produced by Diaghilev,
designed by Pablo Picasso, and composed by Erik Satie. The ballet was
performed in Rome. Apollinaire wrote the program notes, inventing the
word "surrealism" in the process. Satie and Picasso realized that they
had more in common with each other than with Cocteau, who at that time
was a conservative by though and a rebel in art. "Picasso has ideas
that I like better than our Jean's," confessed Satie. "How awful!" the
audience hissed at the symbolic beginning of modern art. "If it had not
been for Apollinaire in uniform," wrote Cocteau, "with his skull
shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women
would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins." </p>
<p><em>Le Potomak</em> (1919), which established Cocteau's
reputation as a writer,&nbsp;was a prose fantasy centering around a
creature, who lives caged in an aquarium. The theme of the poet's
ability to see clearly into the world of the dead was a central theme
is Cocteau's early poems, such as in 'L'ange Heurtebise'&nbsp;
(1925).&nbsp; Cocteau's first major work of criticism, <em>Le Rappel à
l'ordre</em>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1926. His adaptation of Sophocles'<i>
Antigone </i>was performed in 1922 with scenery by Picasso and music
by Paul Honegger. However, Coco Chanel stole many headlines with the
costumes she made for the play. </p>
<p>During World War I Cocteau served as an ambulance driver on
the Belgian front. His poems from this period, <em>Le Cap de
Bonne-Espérance</em> (1919), established him among the first rank of
young poets. Soon after the war he met the future poet and novelist <a href="radiqu.htm">Raymond Radiguet</a>,
whose early death of typhoid
fever was a hard blow to him. To relieve his grief,&nbsp; Cocteau
rented a room (number 6) from the Hôtel Napoleon (a.k.a. Hôtel
Saint-Germain-des-Prés) where he held small gatherings and smoked
opium. After he moved out, the American novelist occupied the room and
wrote there much of her fictionalized autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">We Lived as Children</span>. Cocteau's
Parisian residence was at 10 Rue d'Anjou, but usually he worked in a
nearby hotel. Madame de Chivgny (Madame de Guermantes in Marces
Proust's <span style="font-style: italic;">Remembrance of Things Past</span>)
live one flight below Cocteau. </p>
<p>With <i>Thomas the Impostor</i> (1923) Cocteau turned to the
psychological novel. The masterpiece <em>Les Enfants terribles</em>
(1929), written in three weeks, was about four children who are trapped
in their own frightening world. In 1929 Cocteau was hospitalized for
opium poison. <em>Opium</em> (1930) was an account of his addiction. <br>
</p>
<p>In 1926 Coctau designated the set for
the opera <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i> by Claude Debussy.&nbsp;He also
collaborated with Stravinsky on<i> Oedipus-Rex</i>, an opera-oratoria. <em>Orphée</em>
(1926), an original, one-act tragedy, was performed in Paris by Georges
and Ludmilla Pitoëff. <em>La Voix humaine</em> (1930) was an
one-character play consisting of a telephone conversation. The famous
sketch <em>Le Bel Indifférent</em> (1940), about an older woman and
her younger, indifferent lover, was originally written for Edith Piaf. </p>
<p>Cocteau's first feature film, <i>The Blood of a Poet</i>, was
based on his own private mythology. Typical for his films is the use of
a mirror as a door into another world. For Cocteau, reality was
mystery. In <i>The Blood of a Poet</i> Enrique Rivero crashes through
the surface of a large mirror. "Try, always try," his muse, Lee Miller,
says. The hostility of the surrealists led Cocteau to abandon the
avant-garde for something closer to classicism. His greatest play, <i>The
Infernal Machine</i>, written before WW II, presented Oedipus as a
marionette in the&nbsp;hands of&nbsp;gods. The work was based on <em>Oedipus
Rex</em> by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles. </p>
<p>As the result of a bet with the newspaper <i>Paris-Soir</i>,
Cocteau completed the itinery imagined by Jules Verne in <i>Around the
World in Eighty Days</i>, depicting his travels in <i>My First Voyage</i>
(1936). His close friendship with young Jean Marais started in 1937,
when Marais played the role in the play <i>Knights of the Round Table</i>.
From this production, he designed leading roles especially for Marais. </p>
<p>In the 1940s Cocteau returned to filmmaking, producing <i>Beauty
and the Beast</i> (1946), <em>Orphée</em> (1950), and<em> Le testament
d'Orphée</em>&nbsp;(1961), in which he played himself on the screen.
The film dealt with one of Cocteau's favorite theme, the death, which
he called his "mistress." "As I grow shorter, she grows longer, she
takes up more room, she worries about little details, she busies
herself with unimportant, trivial tasks. She makes less and less of an
effort to deceive me. But her hour of triumph will be that in which I
cease to be. Then she can consider her troubles over and done with, and
leave, shutting the door behind her." </p>
<p>In<i> Orphée </i>Cocteau connected the theme of death with
the theme of inspiration. Jean Marais is a celebrated poet. He visits a
café where receives the advice: "Astonish us." A Princess (Maria
Casarès) tries to prevent a drunken young poet, Cégèste (Edouard
Dhermite) from scattering his papers about. He is
knocked over by two motor-cyclists. Orphée carries Cégèste to
Princess's Rolls Royce. Her chauffeur, Heurtebise, phones the police.
Cégèste dies. The Princess takes Orphée to a chalet, where she leads
Cégèste through a mirror. At home Orphée's wife Eurydice discusses with
the Commissioner of Police and Aglaonice (Juliette Gréco). During the
nights the Princess appears in Orphée's room. The Princess leads
Eurydice to the underworld. Heurtebise tells Orphée that there is a
chance of reclaiming Eurydice. "Mirrors are the doors through which
death comes and goes..." he says. Beyond the
mirror&nbsp;&#8211; the Zone&nbsp;&#8211; he is allowed to reclaim Eurydice, but on
the condition that he never looks at her again. The Princess and Orphée
declare their undying love for each other. Aglaonice and her friends
want to revenge the death of Cégèste and Orphée is killed. Again
Heurtebise and Orphée return to The Zone. The Princess orders Cégèste
and Heurtebise to 'kill' the poet who awakes beside Eurydice. The
Princess and Heurtebise must face their own punishment. "One might see
the Princess as a black angel, a guardian devil, trying to prevent
Orphée from a healthy domestic life with Eurydice. Or, if the film is
an allegory about the poet and the poetry, the Princess is a false
muse, a black goddess, a 'negative' of the white variety worshipped by
Robert Graves."<font size="2"> (from</font><i><font size="2"> Durgnat
on Film </font></i><font size="2">by Raymond Durgnat, 1976) </font></p>
<p>Cocteau's mother, Eugénie Lecomte, died in 1943. During World
War II the Vichy government branded Cocteau as "decadent." However,
Cocteau himself wrote a salute in 1942 to a fascist artist, Arno
Becker, a mistake which did not go unnoticed. Cocteau's colleague, the
poet Paul Eluard was disappointed: "We used to see you among the
forbidden. How wrong you were to expose yourself among the censors."
The collaborationist press denounced him as a homosexual and German
police closed performances of his plays after riots. Although Cocteau
was never ostensibly interested in politics, he denounced the Vichy
government, but took no active part in the Resistance. In
1949&nbsp;Cocteau was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.&nbsp;He
made</p>
<p>Cocteau's romantic play <em>L'Aigle à deux têtes</em> (1946),
which took its theme from the murder of Empress Elizabeth of Austria,
has been filmed twice. The first version from 1947 was directed by the
author himself, starring Edwige Feuillére as the Queen, and Jean Marais
as her lover and would-be assassin. A new version was made in 1980 by <a href="antonion.htm">Michelangelo Antonioni</a> under the title <i>The
Mystery of Oberwald</i>. Antonioni was not especially fond of the
original play,&nbsp;most of all&nbsp;he wanted to work with Monica
Vitti, who&nbsp;was cast in&nbsp;the role of the Queen. </p>
<p>In 1949 Cocteau made a trip to the United States and a
theatrical tour of the Middle East. He continued living an active life
until 1953 when ill healt forced him into semiretirement. Cocteau still
went on to astonish the public. He had his face lifted and he started
to wear leather trousers and matador's capes. In 1955 he was elected to
Belgian Academy and the Acadèmie Française <font face="Symbol">-</font>
Picasso's design for the sword hilt of the Academician's traditional
insignia was a drawing of a toilet seat, a flushing chain and a
toilet-bowl brush. In his last decade Cocteau worked in a wide variety
of graphic arts. At the age of 70 he painted frescos in the town hall
of Menton and in the chapel of Saint-Pierre at Ville-franche-sur Mer.
Cocteau's mural at Notre-Dame de France in London were finished in
1960. Unconventionally, we see the crucified figure in the middle only
from knees down; the identity of the figure is open to speculations. At
the foot of the cross is a rose, a Rose-Croix device. The artist
himself is among characters in the foreground, but he has turned his
back on the cross. </p>
<p>As his private life, Cocteau's Catholicism was highly
unorthodox. In later part of his life, he redecorated churches. It has
said that Cocteau was also the Grand Master of a secret brotherhood,
the Priority of Sion, originally founded in Jerusalem in 1099. Cocteau
appeared on the list of Sion's alleged Grand Masters as Jean XIII. </p>
<p>"To enclose the collected works of Cocteau one would need not
a bookshelf, but a warehouse..." said W.H. Auden once. Cocteau died in
Milly, outside Paris, on October 11, 1963. He was preparing a radio
broadcast in memory of Edith Piaf and when he head she had expired, he
exclaimed: "Ah, la Piaf est morte, je peux mourir"<b><font size="2">,</font></b>
and sank into a coronary himself. Cocteaus's last film was his faithful
adaptation of the novel from Madame de La Fayette, <i>The Princess of
Cleves</i>. The American artist and film maker Andy Warhol, who perhaps
felt a spiritual affinity with Cocteau, later developed the vision of
him as an icon in a series of screenprints. </p>
