      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Japanese novelist who was awarded
the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1994. Oe has often dealt with marginal people
and outcasts and isolation from individual level to social and cultural
levels. Another central theme <font face="Symbol">-</font> as in the
works of a number of other Japanese writers <font face="Symbol">-</font>
is the conflict between traditions and modern Western culture. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">My
observation is that after one hundred and twenty years of modernisation
since the opening of the country, present-day Japan is split between
two opposite poles of ambiguity. I too am living as a writer with this
polarisation imprinted on me like a deep scar."</font></b><font size="2">
(from Nobel Lecture, 1994)</font> </blockquote>
      <p>Kenzaburo Oe was born in a mountain village on the island of
Shikoku, the smallest of the four main Japanese islands, where his
family had lived for centuries. The village and the forests surrounding
it later inspired several of Oe's pastoral works. Oe's father died in
the Pacific war in 1944, and in the same year he lost his grandmother,
who had taught him art and oral performance. After attending a local
school, Oe transferred to a high school in Matsuyama City. He won an
admission to the University of Tokyo, where he studied French
literature and received his B.A. in 1959. His final-year thesis was on
the French writer Jean-Paul Sartre. Another important French writer for
Oe was Albert Camus. </p>
      <p>During these years he started to write and explore his
childhood, when the World War II had filled his mind with horror and
excitement. His early works expressed the of the degradation and
disorientation caused by Japan's surrender at the end of World War II.
Sex and violence labelled his depiction of rootless young people. Oe
wanted to experiment with language and create a new way of literary
expression, which would capture the social and psychological changes
that took place in his home country. He also had to cope with a
personal handicap, the inferiority complex of a shy young man from the
country, who stuttered and spoke with heavy Shokoku accent. </p>
      <p>Oe's first novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Memushiri kouchi</span> (1958, Nip the Buds, Shoot
the Kids), which has been compared to Golding's <i>Lord of the Flies</i>
and Camus's <i>The Plague</i>, and won the Akutagawa Prize given to
young writers of fiction. Between 1958 and 1964, Oe wrote several
stories that reflected the life of a college student, but they did not
gain critical success. In 1960 he travelled to China as a member of
Japan-China Literary delegation. Later Oe created contacts to Chinese
dissident writers living in the United States. In the 1960s, Oe joined
New Left movement. He became one of most important the voices of the
postwar generation. Oe's strong sense of social involvement led him in
the anti-American Security Treaty protests in 1960, he was an
antinuclear spokesman and involved in radical causes. Although gaining
the status of highly influential political writer, Oe never joined any
political party. </p>
      <p>In his early novels Oe explored the nature of antisocial
violence as well as perverse sexuality, as in his 1958 novella <span style="font-style: italic;">Memushiri kouchi</span>. In an early story, <i>Shiiku</i> (1958, Prize Stock),
the hero is propelled from the innocent world of childhood into
adulthood by various acts of madness, raging from the madness of war to
the temporary insanity of his father, who murders a prisoner of war
with an ax. Themes of madness appear in his works as metaphors for the
human condition, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">Hiroshima noto</span> (1964), an essay about the
public madness of nuclear warfare.&nbsp;<font size="2"><font size="2"></font></font><span style="font-style: italic;">Sora no kaibutsu Agu&#299;</span> (1964, Agwhee the Sky Monster) was a sly variation of
      <a href="/hjames.htm">Henry James</a>' <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>
(1898), where a young father, a composer, has allowed his child to die
at the hands of unscrupulous doctors and is visited by a ghost baby
called Aghwee. The tale is narrated by a young student who has been
hired to watch the composer. </p>
      <p>Right-wing activism was Oe's subject in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sevunt&#299;n</span> (1961, Seventeen),
which was based on an actual historical incident. The protagonist is a
pathetic adolescent. Involved in terrorism, he assassinates a socialist
politician and then kills himself in the emperor's name. Later Oe
returned to the theme in the novella <i>The Day He Himself Shall Wipe
My Tears Away</i>. This work, which has been counted as one of the most
"difficult" texts for reader or translator in modern Japanese
literature, was a sustained attack on the famous writer <a href="/mishima.htm">Mishima Yukio</a>, who attempted a right-wing coup
in 1970 and subsequently committed suicide by seppuku. The English
translator of the book, John Nathan, has described meeting Oe at a
party at Mishima's house during which Oe insulted the host. Oe has has
contested the claim. The novella also criticizes the emperor system,
and warns of the dangers of fanatical beliefs. </p>
      <p>Oe married in 1960 Yakari Itami; they had three children. His
wife is the younger sister of Juzo Itami, an acclaimed director of such
films as <i>Tampopo</i>, <i>The Funeral</i> and <i>A Taxing Woman</i>.
In 1963 he became the father of a baby boy, Hikari (which means
'light'), who was born with congenital abnormality of the skull. When
the doctors advised Oe and his wife to let Hikari die, he rejected
their advice. The birth of Hikari was a turning point in Oe's life and
in his literary career. Much of Oe's later fiction examined
relationship between disabled and nondisabled people. Hikari turned out
to be exceptionally gifted in music, and he is acknowledged as one of
the most famous composers in Japan. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He was that kind of man: no one
would find it odd that he should let his wife go alone to a party while
he remained in his study working on a translation (something, in fact,
that we were collaborating on)." </b></font> <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Silent Cry</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Man'en gannen no futtoboru</span> (1967, The Silent Cry) won the
Tanizaki Junichiro Prize. <i> </i>It depicted two urban brothers, who
return to their village in the mountains. From <i>The Silent Cry </i>Oe
became increasingly interested in rural folk legends. <span style="font-style: italic;">Kojinteki na taiken</span> (A Personal Matter, translated into English in 1968), was
received enthusiastically in America. Bird, the novel's protagonist, is
a young man who dreams of exploring Africa and attempts to escape the
responsibility of having fathered a brain-damaged child. Bird plots
with an old girlfriend to murder the child. In the course of the story,
he grows up but befoe it he has a marathon sex session and vomits in
front of his students. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Warera no ky&#333;ki wo ikinobiru
michi wo oshieyo</span> (1969), consisting of four novellas, won the
Noma Literary Prize, and was translated into English entitled <i>Teach
Us to Outgrow Our Madness</i> in 1978. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Pinchi ran'n&#257; ch&#333;sho</span> (1976) a
father and idiot son lead an army of marginals against the Japanese
establishment. <span style="font-style: italic;">K&#333;zui wa waga
tamashii ni oyobi</span> (1973) won the Naoma Literary Prize.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Atarashii hito yo, mezameyo</span> (1983)
marked the return to the life of musically talented Hikari, who was
turning twenty. The Japanese critics named it the book of the year and
it received the Osaragi Jiro Prize for non-fiction. <i>A Quiet Life </i>(1996)
had again autobiographical elements. A famous Japanese writer, whose
first name begins with K, leaves his mentally retarded son in the care
of his daughter Ma-Chan, to spend a year in the University of
California as a writer in residence. Ma-Chan writes her thoughts in a
diary. "Regardless of which elements are fact and which are fiction,
''A Quiet Life'' belongs to the literary genre of the confession; by
rediscovering the family life he has neglected, a writer comes to terms
with the human losses he has suffered in the course of gaining literary
eminence."<font size="2"><b> </b>(</font><font size="2">John David
Morley in <i>The New York Times</i>, </font><font size="2">November
17, 1996</font><font size="2">) </font> </p>
      <p>Oe has also published essays and short stories. His first book
after the Nobel Prize, <i>The Healing Family</i>, tells about his son
Hikari. His major works from the 1990s include trilogy <span style="font-style: italic;">Moeagaru midori no ki</span>, an
exploration of themes of faith and salvation, with complex allusions to
William Blake, Dante, and William Butler Yeats. Oe has once said "Yeats
is the writer in whose wake I would like to follow." <span style="font-style: italic;">Chiryou tou</span> (1990) was a dystopian
novel. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ch&#363;gaeri</span> (1999,
Somersault), about a movement called the Church of the New Man, was
based on the nerve gas attack on the metro in 1995 in Tokyo. A
religious doomsday cult was responsible for the act of terrorism, in
which twelve people were killed. Although Oe is considered by many the
finest writer in Japan today, his social criticism has been rejected. </p>
      <p>Oe has travelled abroad widely. In 1961 he travelled to
Western and Eastern Europe, in 1965 and 1968 to the United States, in
1968 to Australia, and in 1970 Southeast Asia. He has been visiting
professor at the Colegio de México, Mexico City in 1976, and the
University of California at Berkely. In 1989 the Europelia Arts
Festival named Oe the recipient of the Europelia Award.</p>
