<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Italian literary critic, novelist, semiotician, who gained international fame with his intellectual detective story<em> <span class="st">Il nome della rosa</span></em>&nbsp;(1980,
The Name of the Rose), a book about books. It extended the use of
semiotics to fiction, and combined various genres, literary theory,
mediaeval studies, mystery, and biblical exegesis. As a semiotician Eco
is known for his contribution to the theoretical study of signs
encompassing all cultural phenomena. Much of his study, including <i>A Theory of Semiotics</i> (1976), has been on the development of a methodology of communication. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the beginning was the Word and the
Word was with God, the the Word was God. This was beginning with God
and the duty of every faithful monk would be to repeat every day with
chanting humility the one never-changing event whose incontrovertible
truth can be asserted."</b> (in <em>The Name of the Rose</em></font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Umberto Eco was born in Alessandria &#8211; the city is known for the
Borsalino company, the maker of the famous hats. His father, Giulio
was&nbsp;the chief&nbsp;accountant at an iron works. Giovanna
Bisio,&nbsp;Eco's mother, was employed&nbsp;there as an office worker.
Like a lot of young people at that time,&nbsp;Eco&nbsp;was proud of his
fascist uniform, and it was not until the fall of Mussolini, when he
discovered the meaning of plurality, democracy and freedom. At the age
of fourteen, Eco joined the Catholic youth organization and some years
later, he&nbsp;penned his first poems. "... there are two kinds of
poets: good ones, who burn their poems at the age of eighteen, and bad
ones, who keep writing poetry for as long as they live", Eco once said.
</p><p>After completing his <i>maturità classica</i> at the Liceo
Plane, Eco enrolled at the University of Turin, receiving his doctoral
degree in 1954. Luigi Pareyson (1918-91), who was Eco's teacher at
Turin, influenced deeply Eco's ideas on interpretation and aesthetics.
Eco also wrote a review on Pareyson's <i>Estetica</i> for <i>Lettere italiane</i>
in 1955. Eco's classmate was the hermeneutic ontologist and
aesthetician Gianni Vattimo, who succeeded Pareyson as Professor of
Aesthetics at Turin. </p>

<p>Eco's doctoral thesis dealt with the aesthetics of the early
philosopher and religious thinker St. Thomas Aquinas. It was a
controversial subject because it was generally believed that there were
no aesthetic reflections in his <em>oeuvre</em>. Eco, who had been a
militant Catholic intellectual in the early 1950s, confessed later in
an interview that he stopped believing in God after his studies. "You
could say he miraculously cured me of my faith." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Time</font></i><font size="2">, June 13, 2005)</font>
From 1954 to 1959 Eco worked in Milan as a cultural editor for RAI,
Italian Radio-Television, also lecturing at the University of Turin
(1956-64). In 1958-59 Eco served in the army. He was a university
teacher in Milan (1964-65) and Florence (1965-69). From 1969 to 1971 he
was a teacher at Milan Polytechnic. At the early age of 39 Eco was
appointed professor of semiotics at Bologna University in the north of
Italy. He has also taught at Harvard and Yale. </p>
<p>Eco's literary career began in the late 1950s, when he was a columnist for <i>Il Verri</i>, writing 
'Diario minimo' (1959-61). He was cofounder of <i>Marcatré </i>(1961) and <i>Quindici</i> (1967), 
edited <i>Versus</i> from 1971, and was a member of the editorial board of <i>Semiotica</i>, 
<i>Degrés</i>, <i>Text</i>, <i>Structuralist Review</i>, <i>Communication</i>, 
<i>Problemi dell'Informazione</i>, and <i>Alfabeta</i>. Eco has contributed regularly 
to daily newspapers (<i>Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica</i>), weekly magazines 
(<i>L'Espresso</i>), and artistic and intellectual periodicals (<i>Quindici</i>, <i>Il Verri</i>,
et al.). Eco has written from the 1970s for quite separate audiences &#8211;
general readers on the one hand, and academic specialists on the other.
His articles have appeared in such books as&nbsp;<em>Diario minimo</em> (1963), <em>Il costume di casa</em> (1973),<em> Dalla periferia dell'impero</em> (1977), and<i> How to Travel with a Salmon</i>
(1992). In these books the reader can enjoy Eco's playful insights on
such topics as militarism, computer jargon, Westerns, airplane food,
librarians, Amtrak trains, bad coffee, express mail, fax machines,
porno films, and football fans. A writer, not a reader, Eco has said in
an interview, that he has never read&nbsp; <em>Mahabharata</em>&nbsp; or <em>Kama Sutra</em>, and he never finished Thackeray's novel <em>Vanity Fair</em>, finding it "terribly dull". <font size="2">(<em>The Guardian</em>, 22 May, 2011)</font> Eco's own personal library in his various homes contains some 50,000 books and 1,200 rare titles. </p>
<p>From 1959 to 1975 Eco was a senior editor of non-fiction at Bompiani
publishers in Milan. From 1979 Eco has been a vice president of the
International Association for Semiotic Studies. He founded and edits
the journal of semiotics, VS. Although he has written a number of
essays on mass media and modern culture, he has been always attracted
to the mediaeval world, and published a study about the development of
medieval aesthetics (1969) and an analysis of the Beato of Leibana's
manuscript (1973). "The view that the Middle Ages were puritanical, in
the sense of rejecting the sensuous world, ignores the documentation of
the period and shows basic misunderstanding of the medieval mentality,"
Eco wrote in <i>Art and Beauty in the Middle Ages </i>(1986). He has
received several awards, among them Strega Prize (1981), Viareggio
Prize (1981), Anghiari Prize (1981), Medicis Prize (1982), McLuhan
Teleglobe Prize (1985). He has also honorary degrees from several
universities. Eco is married to Renate Ramge, a German-born graphic
artist, who helped translate <span class="st"><em>Il pendolo di Foucault</em></span>&nbsp;into German. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It has been said that narrative worlds are always <i>little worlds</i>, because they do not constitute a maximal and complete state of things... In this sense narrative worlds are <i>parasitical</i>,
because, if the alternative properties are not specified, we take for
granted the properties that hold good in the real world. In <i>Moby-Dick</i> it is not expressly stated that all the sailors abroad <i>Pequod</i>
have two legs, but the reader ought to take it as implicit, given that
the sailors are human beings. On the other hand, the account takes care
to inform us that Ahab had only one leg, but, as far as I remember, it
does not say which, leaving us free to use our imagination, because
such a specification has no bearing on the story."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Kant and the Platypus</font></i><font size="2">, 1997</font><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p>Eco's major studies in aesthetics, literature, communication and semiotics are&nbsp; <em>Opera aperta</em> (1962, rev. ed., 1972, 1976), <em>A Theory of Semiotics</em> (1976), in which he took up and developed various lines of research begun in the latter half of the 1960s, <i>Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language</i> (1984), <i>The Limits of Interpretation </i>(1991).
From the time of Eco's early writing semiotics has become central to a
great number of disciplines. Eco sees it as a sign of success and
health, but has confessed that writing an updated version of <i>A Theory of Semiotics </i>and producing a new systematization, would be rash. </p>

<p>However, in <i>Kant and the Platypus</i> (1997) he returned to the
text again, examining how much our perception of things depends on our
cognitive ability, and how much on our linguistic resources. And where,
and how, do these two questions meet. Referring to Pascal, Aristotle
and Heidegger, Eco starts with the problem of Being (Seinde and Sein in
Heidegger). Pascal wrote in 1655: "One cannot begin to define being
without falling victim to this absurdity: one cannot define a word
without beginning with the term is, be it expressly stated or merely
understood. To define being, therefore, you have to say is, thus using
the term to be defined in the definition." There is no definition for
being, but being it is that enables all subsequent definitions to be
made and it underpins all discourses except the one we hold about it.
Language does not construct being ex novo: it questions it, in some way
always finding something already given. Eco accepts the idea that our
descriptions of the world are always perspectival &#8211; the world as we
represent it to ourselves is an effect of interpretation. Being sets
limits for us and it is possible that there are regions of being of
which we are unable to talk. But the language of the Poets seems to let
us glimpse what could be beyond the limit. "What the Poets are really
saying to us is that we need to encounter being with gaiety (and
hopefully with science too), to question it, test its resistance, grasp
its openings and its hints, which are never too explicit." </p>

<p>While taking over many of the fundamentals of the structuralist
theory of Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roman Jacobson and of the theories of
structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure, Eco differs
drastically from them. In <em>Opera aperta</em> and&nbsp; <em>Lector in fabula</em>
(1979) he criticized the view that meaning is the production of a
structure, and saw that the reader uses two main concepts in the
process of interpretative cooperation: the reader inserts in the text
the 'possible worlds' and the 'frames', situations or sequences of
action, in order to complete its meaning. Semiotics is according to Eco
"the science of everything subject to the lie: it is also the science
of everything subject to the comic or tragic distortion". </p>
<p>As an essayist Eco's writings oscillate between 'academic' and
personal reflections. He opposes both the believers of a superior
elitist culture and those whose are so fascinated by mass culture that
they have lost their critical judgment. Eco has dealt with spy novels,
comic books, serial novels by Dumas or Eugène Sue, objects of the
popular culture that the traditional critic has ignored. In 1991 Eco's <em>Sguardi venuti da lontano</em>
launched a new discipline, 'reciprocal anthropology' as a result of a
convention held in Italy. The scholars from African and Asian countries
carefully observed Western people, and came to the conclusion that
Westerners are barbaric. One of Eco's theories is that modern art,
especially in the forms of music, poetry and fiction, often expresses
deliberately uncertain messages. This allows the reader or listener to
take an active part in deciding the meaning of a work of art. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"We are frequently misled by a "mass
media criticism of mass media" which is superficial and regularly
belated. Mass media are still repeating that our historical period is
and will be more and more dominated by images. That was the first <a href="mcluhan.htm">McLuhan</a>
fallacy, and mass media people have read McLuhan too late. The present
and the forthcoming young generation is and will be a computer-oriented
generation. The main feature of a computer screen is that it hosts and
displays more alphabetic letters than images. The new generation will
be alphabetic and not image oriented. We are coming back to the
Gutenberg Galaxy again, and I am sure that if McLuhan had survived
until the Apple rush to the Silicon Valley, he would have acknowledged
this portentous event."</b> (Eco in </font><i><font size="2">The Future of the Book</font></i><font size="2">, ed. Geoffrey Nunberg, 1996) </font></blockquote>
<p>In <i>The Search for the Perfect Language</i> (1995) Eco examined
the history of the idea that there once existed a language, spoken
before the collapse of the Tower of Babel, which perfectly expressed
the essence of all possible things and concepts. <i>Belief or Nonbelief </i>(2000) is an exchange of letters between Umberto Eco and Carlo Maria Martini, the Roman Catholic cardinal of Milan. </p>

<p>Eco's most famous novel, <i>Il nome della rosa</i> (1980, The Name of the Rose), is set in the 
14th-century Italian abbey where the power of life and death lies with the Inquisition. A breakaway 
sect, the Fraticelli, threaten the wealth and political influence of the Church. William of Baskerville, 
accompanied by his novice Adso of Melk, try to prove that a series of murders is not the work of the 
Devil. They find that the blind librarian Jorge de Burgos &#8211; a homage to the Argentinean writer 
<a href="jlborges.htm">Jorge Luis Borges</a> &#8211; is behind the murders: he protects Aristotle's 
missing manuscript about comedy, the lost second book of <i>Poetics</i>. The abbey library and monastery 
burn down in an infernal fire and the manuscript disappears. "But there is general agreement 
that in the course of telling a rich and fascinating tale Eco also explores the diversity, contradictions, 
and complexity of the medieval world, and in the course of doing so raises questions about our own: not 
least, from the library, repository of past learning and current speculation, about what constitutes 
culture, what is transmitted, by whom and for what purposes." 
<font size="2">(<i>Contemporary World Writers</i>, ed.&nbsp; Tracy Chevalier, 1993)</font> </p><p>
The film version of the book, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, took place 
at Klöster Eberbach near Frankfurt, where time has stood still since the 12th-century. 
The outside was built on a hill near Rome, the largest exterior set Europe has seen since the 
making of <i>Cleopatra</i>. <i>The Name of the Rose</i>
has been translated into more than sixteen languages. It won in 1981
two of Italy's main literary awards: the Premio Viareggio and the
Premio Strega. &#8211; "In essence, the basic question of philosophy (as of
psychoanalysis) is the same as that of the detective novel: who is
guilty? To know the answer (to think you know) you have to conjecture
that the facts possess a logic&nbsp; &#8211; the logic that the guilty party
has imposed on them." <font size="2">(in <i>Postille a 'Il nome della rosa'</i>, tr. &nbsp;Michael Dibdin, 1993) </font></p>

<p>Eco's second novel,&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Il pendolo di Foucault</em> </span>(1988,
Foucault's Pendulum), was a mixture of detective story, introduction to
physics and philosophy, and playful analysis of madness and wisdom,
which encompass the whole history of mankind. "So it was not so much
the earth to which I addressed my gaze but the heavens, where the
mystery of the absolute immobility was celebrated. The Pendulum told me
that, as everything moved &#8211; earth, solar system, nebulae and black
holes, all the children of the great cosmic expansion &#8211; one single
point stood still: a pivot, bolt, or hook around which the universe
could move. And I was now taking part in that supreme experience." The
narrator is a young philosophy professor, Causabon, who decides with
his friends to make believe that the Templarians had elaborated a plan
that was going to lead them to the control of a mystic source of power,
greater than all the energy in the world. The friends begin feeding
esoteric bits of knowledge into an incredible computer, and inventing a
map and placing it under Foucault's pendulum in the Conservatoire des
Arts et Métiers in Paris. The plan leads the friends to their deaths. </p>
<p>In an interview in 1989 Eco stated that "to write a third novel is like writing thirty of them, and it doesn't make 
much sense." However, in 1995 Eco published a new novel.&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>L'isola del giorno prima</em>&nbsp;</span>
(The Island of the Day Before). The protagonist, Roberto della Griva, a
seventeenth-century nobleman, finds himself in the South Pacific stuck
upon a mysteriously abandoned ship after a violent storm. With nothing
else to do, Roberto recalls chapters from his youth, but finally
realizes that he isn't alone. His elusive shipmate turns out to be
Father Caspar, who has unlocked the very secrets of time and distance
that Roberto was supposed to secure. Together Roberto and Caspar
attempt to reach a nearby island. </p><p>Eco's fifth novel,<em> </em><span class="st"><em>La misteriosa fiamma della regina Loana</em> </span>(2004,
The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana) told of an antiquarian book
dealer, Giambattista Boldoni, who is struck by amnesia. Boldoni
remembers things he has read, not what he has experienced himself. To
recover his past, Boldoni goes back to his formative years through the
world of entertainment, from Sandokan and Topolino (Mickey Mouse) to
Flash Gordon and Sherlock Holmes, from fascist popular culture to <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i>. 
In the process, Boldoni recreates himself and discovers the true love of his life.<em>&nbsp;</em><span class="st"><em>Il cimitero di Praga</em>&nbsp;</span>(2010, The Prague Cemetery), 
a conspiracy story about truth and lies and the art of forgery, became 
the target of heavy criticism by the Vatican newspaper <i>L'Osservatore</i>. The reviewer, professor Lucetta Scaraffin 
 of Rome's La Sapienza University, described the novel as 
immoral and anti-Semitic. Gianni Riotta defended Eco's vision in <i>Il Sole 24 Ore</i>, writing that the novel is 
"il macabro spettro del nostro presente". The plot revolves around the notorious <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, a hoax document about a purpoted Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. &nbsp;
