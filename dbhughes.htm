<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American mystery writer, who also had 
a career as a critic. Dorothy B. Hughes wrote fourteen crime and mystery novels. <B></B>Her best-known works include&nbsp;<EM>Ride the Pink Horse </EM>(1946) and <EM>In a Lonely Place </EM>(1947), perhaps Hughes's greatest novel. For her criticism Hughes won a 1950 Edgar Award from the
Mystery Writers of America. Hughes lived and worked in New Mexico for the majority of her life. A central theme in several of her stories was racism</P>

He knew she heard him for her heel struck an extra beat, as if she had half stumbled, and her steps went faster.

<P>Dorothy Belle Hughes (n&eacute;e Flanagan) was born in Kansas City, Missouri. She has told that from the age of six, when she learned to write words, she knew she would be a writer. Hughes studied 
journalism at the University of Missouri, from which she received a B.J.
in 1924. She did graduate work at the University of New Mexico and 
also attended Columbia University in New York. Before 
starting her career as a mystery writer, Hughes worked as a journalist 
in Missouri, New York and New Mexico. In 1932 she married Levi Allan Hughes, Jr., who came from an old Santa Fe family. They had two daughters and one son.</P>
<P>Hughes's first published book, <EM>Dark Certainty </EM>(1931), was a collection of poems. It received an award
from the Yale Series of Younger poets. Her first
novel, <EM>The So Blue Marble </EM>(1940), was set in New York. Hughes dedicated this book to her mother, "who will not read mysteries, and her brother, "who first introduced me to them". The protagonist is a divorced woman, a fashion designer, who is drawn into a violent quest for a missing treasure – a tiny blue marble that contains "hieroglyphs telling the secrets of the greatest lost civilization, of the day when the sun was harnessed, as we would like to harness it, when gravitation was controlled as we haven't dreamed of controlling it." Will Cuppy called the book "glittering, but not hard-boiled." Hughes's understated style was partly a result of hard editing – her first editor demanded a cut of 25,000 words from the manuscript and eliminated most of the story's unrealistic elements. <I>The So Blue Marble </I>had preceded several unpublished works, but after it Hughes began delivering, on average, a book a year until 1952, when she stopped publishing novels for eleven years. </P>

<P>Hughes also wrote the history of the University of New 
Mexico. After marrying she made her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, using Southwest for 
backgroud in the novels. Around 1944, the family moved to Los Angeles. Her husband spent much time in New Mexico, taking care of the family business. While in L.A. he played golf. In the early 1960s, Hughes returned to Santa Fe with her husband. </P>
<P>Three of Hughes's books were successfully
made into films: <EM>The Fallenn Sparrow </EM>(1942), starring John Garfied, <I>Ride the Pink Horse</I>, 
directed by Robert Montgomery, and <I>In a Lonely Place</I>, directed by 
Nicholas Ray. "Andrew Solt and Edmund H. North wrote the terrific, unusual script, which includes sharp dialogue and some peculiar secondary characters. Grahame (who was about to get her divorce from Ray) and Bogart (playing his rare tough guy who wants to get married) are an exciting couple. Onetime "sleeper" film has come to be regarded as one of Bogart's classics."<FONT size=2><B> </B>(Danny Perry in <I>Guide for the Film Fanatic</I>, 1986) </FONT></P>
<P><I>Ride the Pink Horse </I>was set against the fiesta background of a small New Mexico town, called "San Pablo", where Robert Montgomery, a war veteran, tracks down a war profiteer, who has been responsible for the murder of his friend. Portions of the film were shot on location in Santa Fe. The city of Taos was paid $2,000 to ship "Tio Vivo", its 1882 carousel, to the Universal studios in California. Ben Hecht's name was omitted from the screen credits in England because of his critical remarks about British military presence in Palestine. Though the original script was approved by the Production Code Administration (PCA), an independent producer complained to the Breen Office about "excessive" drinking in the picture. Montgomery, Wanda Hendrix, and Thomas Gomez, who played a carousel operator, reprised their roles in a Radio Lux Theatre version of the novel in 1947. Don Siegel remade the story in 1964 for TV as <I>The Hanged Man</I>, but set it in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. </P>
<P><I>In a Lonely Place</I> was adapted into screen in 1950 by Nicholas Ray, who softened the story. In this unpredictable and unforgettable<I> film noir </I>Humphrey Bogart played Dixon Steele, an ex-GI, with a dangerous temper. Steele is trying to make a comeback as a successful screenwriter. The police 
thinks he is the murderer of a hatcheck girl he invited to his apartment 
on the night she was killed. Steele's neighbour Laurel (Gloria Grahame) tells the police 
that she saw the girl leave alone. Steele and Laurel fall in love, but
gradually she starts to suspect that Steele killed the girl. The subtext
is about the hunt for Communist in the film industry at the
time, but it also contain such existential lines as "I was born when you kissed me. I died when
y ou left men. I lived a few weeks while you loved me." Hughes composed the book from a killer's point of view. Steele is a psychopathic serial killer who has been recently demobbed and simultaneously robbed his identity. </P>
<P>At the peak of her career Hughes stopped writing novels, explaining that her domestic responsibilities made writing difficult: her mother was ill, she was taking care of her grandchildren, and she simply hadn't the tranquillity required to write. From 1940 to 1979 she reviewed mysteries for the <I>Albuquerque 
Tribune</I>, <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, <I>New York Herald-Tribune
</I> and other newspapers. In 1978 Hughes was named a Grand Master by 
the Mystery Writers of America. She won her second Edgar Allan Poe 
award for her critical biography, <EM>Erle Stanley Gardner: The Case of the Real Perry Mason</EM>(1978), which came out eight years after Gardner's death. Hughes died on May 6, 1993, at her home in Ashland, Ore.</P>
<P>Hughes produced relatively few short stories. The style of 'The Black and White Blues' (1959), about jazz music, extortion, and racial hatred, was praised by the critic and mystery writer Bill Pronzini in <I>American Pulp</I> (1997, ed. Ed Gorman, Bill Pronzini, Martin H. Greenberg). In the story, set in Missouri, a young white girl asks a black musician, a clarinet player, to drive her home after the band has finished its gig.<B> </B>She admires his car, a cream color Chrysler, sees that he has much money, and a big diamond ring. When he kisses her she wipes her mouth and cries: "You dirty nigger. They'll lynch you for this. They'll lynch you!" To keep her silent the musician gives her the diamond ring. "Manager is pretty mad. That good clarinet-paying Negro went back to Chicago. Gave up his job and went back. Didn't say why, just acted kinda nervous. Didn't want to stay no more. Fritz, the orchestra owner, was pretty mad. Clarinet Negro borrowed some money offa him to go." </P>

<P>Most of Hughes's detective fiction centers around outsiders, haunted loners, or
upper-class characters involved in evil intrigues. Hughes herself acknowledged her debt to such writers as Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, and William Faulkner. In <I>The Fallen Sparrow</I> 
(1942) the protagonist is a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, who returns to home to find himself facing again the experiences of war. </P><P><EM>The Expendable Man</EM>&nbsp;(1963) 
became famous for its sudden twist of the plot, revealed in one sentence after some fifty pages. H.R.F. Keating has&nbsp;called in <I>Crime and Mystery: The 100 Best Books</I> (1987) the work as one of the great trick novels of crime fiction. Hugh Densmore, a young doctor, drives his parents' white Cadillac between Los Angeles and Phoenix, Arizona. He reluctantly picks up a young girl wanting a lift. After a girl resembling the one whom Dr Densmore gave the lift has been found dead, Detective Venner questions the hero, who is the first person the police suspect. "We got a tip," he says. "Right after that report went out on the radio. This guy says a nigger doctor driving a big white Cadillac brought Bonnie Lee to Phoenix." Hughes did not mention before that Dr Densmore was black, and now the reader understands that his situation and earlier small paranoid attitudes has much to do with racial issues. Geoffrey O'Brien has written in <I>Hardboiled America </I>(1997) about Hughes's work: "But lyricism they had, these novels, with their rain and shadow and Park Avenue and Madison Avenue suddenly places of fear, and with their sudden eruptions of dream material into an orderly salon (the poet's legacy). Maybe no one will ever be frightened by her books again, but they will perhaps be remained of a surrounding world – the one she wrote in – far more frightening than her own childlike, sometimes magical, adventures." <FONT size=2></FONT></P>
