<p>Portuguese writer, who combined in his work myths, history of his own country, and surrealistic imagination. 
Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1998. Other names from Portugal, often mentioned in Nobel Prize speculations, 
have been António Lobo Antunes, and José Cardoso Pires. "The possibility of the impossible, dreams and 
illusions, are the subject of my novels," Saramago once said. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In one sense it could even be said that,
letter-by-letter, word-by-word, page-by-page, book after book, I have
been successively implanting in the man I was the characters I created.
I believe that without them I wouldn't be the person I am today;
without them maybe my life wouldn't have succeeded in becoming more
than an inexact sketch, a promise that like so many others remained
only a promise, the existence of someone who maybe might have been but
in the end could not manage to be."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Nobel Lecture</font></i><font size="2">, 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p>José Saramago was born in Azinhaga in the province of Ribatejo, the
son of José de Sousa, an artilleryman in the first world war, and Maria
de Piedade. When Saramago was two, the family moved to Lisbon.
Saramago's father took a job as traffic policeman and his mother worked
as a domestic cleaner. During school holidays, he returned to Azinhaga,
where his grandparents, illiterate peasants, lived and took care of
him. At an early age, Saramago was forced to abandon school in order to
earn his living. Saramago was educated as a technician, and before
becoming a journalist, translator, and writer, he did a number of
manual jobs. Saramago married in 1944 Ilda Reis, then a typist with the
Railway Company, who was to become a respected engraver. Their marriage
ended in divorce in 1970. </p>

<p>Saramago joined in 1969 the Communist Party of Portugal, which was 
forbidden during the military dictatorship. In 1975 he lost his job as deputy 
editor of the Lisbon newspaper Diário de Noticias. &#8220;Being fired was the best luck of my life,&#8221; he lated said in an interview.
&#8220;It was the birth of my life as a writer.&#8221; Since 1979 he devoted himself entirely to writing. 

In 1988 
Saramago married Pilar del Río, a journalist. After 
government officials banned his novel 
<em>O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo </em>(1991, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ), Saramago left 
Portugal and settled on the Spanish island of Lanzarote. Saramago died after a long illness at his home on 18 June, 2010.

 </p>

<p>Saramago published plays, short stories, novels, poems, libretti, diaries, and travelogues. His first 
novel, <em>Manual de Pintura e Caligrafia</em>,&nbsp; came out in 1977. Its basic theme is the genesis of the artist, of a painter as well as a writer. In <em>Viagem a Portugal </em>(1981,
Journey to Portugal) Saramago searched for the idea of Portugal, a few
years after the dictatorship had ended. To see his country with with
fresh eyes and fresh wonder, Saramago used the third person, observing
as much his surrounding as his own reactions: "Here he is forced to
recognise his own shortcomings, and admit he has everything to learn.
About miracles, as all else." <em>Levantado do Chão</em> (1980) was a
three-generation saga of a poor sharecropper family from the post-World
War I period through to the 25th April 1974, the date of the Portugese
revolution. The story is presented through mixed forms of monologue and
dialogue.</p>
<p>In the 1980s he gained an international reputation with his satirical novel <em>Memorial do Convento</em>. The novel is set in the first half of the 18th century. The Italian composer Corghi based his opera <i>Blimunda</i> on the novel.&nbsp;<em>O Ano da Morte de Ricardo Reis</em> (1984) takes its subject from the history in the form of a dialogue between the great Portuguese poet <a href="pessoa.htm">Fernando Pessoa</a> (1888-1935), and his alternative authorial personality from the poem collection <i>Odes de Ricardo Reis </i>(1946).
The story is set in the 1930s, the year of the onset of the Spanish
Civil War, and the rise of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar.
Truth and lies are inseparable from each other, in fiction and in real
life: "A word lies, with the same word one can speak the truth, we are
not what we say, we are true only if others believe us." Symbolic <em>A Jangada de Pedra </em>(1986)
tells a story of Portugal's exclusion from Europe: a series of
supernatural events culminates in the severance of the Iberian
peninsula so that it starts to float into the Atlantic, initially
heading for the Azores. Saramago's tone is ironic -- he mixes different
views from the Prime Minister and the US president to tourist officers
and European Community. A group of people tries to find an explanation
for the phenomenon, among them Joaquim Sassa, who threw a stone in the
sea. In 2007 Saramago outraged his compatriots with his statement that
it is inevitable that Portugal will end up joining with Spain. </p>
<p>Saramago's controversial novel, <i>The Gospel According to Jesus Christ</i>,
was excluded from the European Union literary contest Ariosto by Sousa
Lara, Under-Secretary of State of Portugal, but after international
protest it was returned to the list of candidates. Like <a href="kazantza.htm">Nikos Kazantzákis</a> in his novel <i>The Last Temptations of Christ</i>, or Norman Mailer in <i>The Gospel According to the Son</i>,
he interprets the key episodes from the Gospels from an ironic point of
view, inventing new miracles and prophesies. In the novel God and the
Devil negotiate over evil, and Jesus questions his role and challenges
God. All this Saramago paralles with the creative process of a writer:
"The gaping mouth sends up a cry we shall never hear, for none of these
things is real, what we are contemplating is mere paper and ink,
nothing more." Maria Magdalene is a prostitute to whom Jesus gives his
virginity. Joseph's feelings of guilt lead to his crucifixion. Jesus
takes him down from the cross, helped by Maria. He repeats his father's
fate and realizes in his last moments, that his sacrificial death had
been planned in advance. " ... the human heart is never content, and
that doing one's duty does not bring peace of mind, though those who
are easily satisfied would have us believe otherwise." </p>
<p>Among Saramago's other later novels is <i>All the Names </i>(1995), in which he pays homage to the bureaucratic 
labyrinths of Kafka. It depicts a minor official, Senhor José, in a dismal registrar's office, who becomes obsessed 
with one of the names, an unknown woman, and begins to track her down. But instead of order, he finds chaos. In 
<i>Blindness: a novel </i>(1995) an epidemic of blindness starts to spread in a nameless city. An asylum or a 
concentration camp, is founded to isolate the blind who see only white light. A doctor's wife follows her husband 
to the asylum, and soon around them forms a small group of people who try to maintain some moral values among the 
internees, when violence starts to escalate. "... blindness is the good fortune of the ugly," Saramago 
wrote; actually the blind cannot see the ugliness of the world. "Absurd to say it, but the blindness 
in Saramago's novel is an allegory for not being able to see. What exactly it is we should see, what Saramago 
-- with all his years as a man and a writer and having lived through dictatorship and revolution -- fears we 
cannot see, is present in the writing, present abundantly, but it is not to be paraphrased." <font size="2">(Andrew Miller in the</font><i><font size="2"> New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, October 4, 1998)</font> <i>The Cave </i>(2000)
is a story of a potter and his family, who are the "real" people,
living the life of Plato's famous allegory of the cave.&nbsp;<em>O Homem Duplicado</em> (2002) 
played with an old literary cliché, the idea of a doppelganger. 
Saramago's protagonist, a schoolteacher, asks the existential question, which is the original and which the
copy? One of them must die. <em>Ensaio sobre a Lucidez </em>(2004, Seeing), a political satire, was set in the same 
nameless capital city that <i>Blindness</i>, where 
a state of emergency is declared after voters cast blank votes in an election. Saramago's final novel was<em> Caim</em>
(2009, Cain), in which the jovial character of his picaresque hero,
Cain, is juxtaposed with God's&nbsp;coldness and tyrannousness. They
misunderstand each other and at the end Saranago writes, "one thing we
know for certain is that they continued to argue and are arguing still.
The story, though, is over, there will be nothing more to tell."
