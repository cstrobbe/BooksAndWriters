<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->German philosopher, one of the most controversial and original thinkers of the 20th century. <i>Sein und Zeit</i>
(1927, Being and Time), Heidegger's most famous publication, deals with
the question of Being. Although Heidegger has been dismissed sometimes
as unintelligible, his thoughts have influenced Sartrean
existentialism, philosophical hermeneutics, Derridean deconstruction,
literature criticism, theology, psychotherapy, aesthetics and even
environmental studies. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"All research&nbsp;&#8211; especially when it
moves in the sphere of the central question of being&nbsp;&#8211; is an ontic
possibility of Da-sein. The being of Da-sein finds its meaning in
temporality." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Being and Time</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Martin Heidegger was born in Messkirch, Baden-Württenberg, the son
of Friedrich Heidegger, a Catholic sexton, and Johanna Heidegger (née
Kempf). In his childhood Heidegger developed an interest in religion.
While still at school he read Franz Brentano's (1838-1917) academic
essay <i>On the Manifold Meaning of Being According to Aristotle </i>(1862), which led him to Edmund Husserl's <i>Logical Investigations</i>
(1900-01), the founding work of the phenomenological movement.
Heidegger read it again and again in the years to follow. At the age of
twenty he decided to become a Jesuit, but his noviciate lasted only two
weeks. He then entered the theological seminary of Freiburg University,
receiving his doctorate in 1913 with a thesis on the doctrine of
judgment in psychologism. Heidegger's habilitation thesis on the
philosophy of Duns Scotus appeared in 1915. During WW I Heidegger's
career in the army was sporadic, and he was released several times for
health reasons. In 1917 Heidegger married Thea Elfride Petri, his
former student; they had two sons and a daughter. </p>

<p>At Freiburg Edmund Husserl made him his private assistant
(1920-1923). Heidegger was fascinated by Husserl's early writings, but
did not accept his programme of "transcendental phenomenology".
Husserl's critics accused him of ending in solipsism. By 1919 Heidegger
ended his struggle with Roman Catholic scholastic philosophy and wrote
in a letter: "Epistemological insights encroaching upon the theory of
historical knowledge have made the system of Catholicism problematic
and unacceptable to me&nbsp;<strong><font size="2">&#8211;</font></strong> but not Christianity and metaphysics..." </p>

<p>Karl Jaspers, already a well-known figure in German intellectual
life, met Heidegger in 1920, and soon felt united with him in their
common opposition to academic rituals. The friendship survived
Heidegger's crushing review of Jaspers's <i>Psychology of Worldviews</i>.
Later Heidegger's engagement with Nazism separated the two
philosophers. In 1922 Heidegger became a teacher of philosophy at the
University of Marburg, where he lectured on Greek, medieval, and German
idealist philosophy. A charismatic and inspiring lecturer, he attracted
students from all over Europe. <a href="arendt.htm">Hannah Arendt </a>(1906-1975),
born into an old Jewish family, started in 1924 to attend Heidegger's
lectures. "There was hardly more than a name, but the name traveled all
over Germany like rumor of the hidden king...," Arendt recalled in her
essay 'Martin Heidegger at Eighty' (1969). She became Heidegger's
lover, offering him her "unbending devotion." They met in Arendt's
attic room in absolute secrecy; the only witness was Arendt's little
roommate, a mouse, which she fed. She was also his muse for <i>Being and Time</i>. </p>

<p>Heidegger published his major work, <i>Being and Time</i>, at the
age of thirty-eight. When his mother died in 1927, Heidegger put on her
deathbed his own copy of the book. Gilbert Ryle, reviewing the work in <i>Mind </i>(1929)
drew attention to Heidegger's "unflagging energy with which he tries to
think beyond the stock categories of orthodox psychology and
philosophy." Nowadays<i> Being and Time </i>can be read as a complementary work or anti-thesis to <a href="spengle.htm">Oswald Spengler</a>'s <i>The Decline of the West </i>(1918-22),
both intellectual monuments to the crumbling Weimar State. However, the
prophesies of Spengler and other writers of doom Heidegger dismissed as
sensational. When Spengler dealt with the life and death of
civilizations, Heidegger focused on the Being of human beings, and
death. <i>Was ist Metaphysik?</i> (1929, What is Metaphysics?) he
ended with the question: "Why are there beings at all, why not rather
nothing." Rudolf Carnap condemned the work as strictly meaningless in
his essay 'Überwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der
Sprache' (1932). </p>

<p>In Germany Spengler's ideas were discussed widely, but the ideas of <i>Being and Time</i>
were understandable only for a limited group of people, and it never
was the favorite reading of ordinary SA brownshirts in the 1930s. The
"barely decipherable" book, as one critic said, established Heidegger's
fame as a major European philosopher. Heidegger succeeded Edmund
Husserl as Professor of Philosophy at Freiburg. His inaugural lecture,
'Was ist Metaphysik', was his first major essay; the essay, written in
poetic prose, became for Heidegger in the postwar period his primary
form of expression. Heidegger never published the second part of his <i>magnum opus</i>, dealing with the history of ontology, Kant, Descartes' <i>cogito ergo sum</i>, and Aristotle, but <i>Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics</i> (1929) and lectures on Cartesian ontology and the Aristotelian conception of time mostly covered the rest of his writing plan. </p>

<p>The clash between idealist cultural philosophy and revolutionary
existentialism become evident in the legendary discussion in Davos in
1929 between <a href="cassir.htm">Ernst Cassirer</a>, champion of the
republic and humanist tradition, and Heidegger, who was famous for
rejecting all social conventions. The place had also been the scene of
Thomas Mann's novel <i>Magic Mountain </i>(1924), which depicted a
fight between liberal and conservative values, the enlightened
civilized world and non-rational beliefs. <br>
</p>
      <p>Herbert Marcuse, who became Heidegger's assistant in 1928,
attempted to synthesize Heidegger's thought with Marxism. Whether
Heidegger himself ever really studied Marx, is an open question. In the
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Letter on Humanism</span>,
published after the war, he said that Marx's view of history excels all
other history. Basically Heidegger's artificial, airtight world of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dasein</span>, removed from reality and defined by anxiety, dread, boredom and so on, was far from the historical concreteness of <span style="font-style: italic;">Das Kapital</span>
and its message of liberation and a salvation. Marcuse saw Heidegger
again after the war. They had a talk but there was no reconciliation
between the two philosophers separated by their stance toward Nazism. <font size="-1">(<span style="font-style: italic;">The Essential Marcuse</span>, edited by Andrew Feenberg and William Leiss, 2007, pp. 116-121)</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1933 Heidegger joined the Nazi Party and cut off his
relations with all his Jewish colleagues, including Husserl. By taking
this step, Heidegger made it plain, that the German Idealism has come to an end. "Let not principles and
ideas rule your being," he declared. "Today, and in the future, only
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Führer</span> himself is German reality and its law." When <em>Being and Time</em>
was reprinted in 1937, its dedication to Husserl was omitted. Arendt,
who was arrested for eight days, left Germany for Paris and eventually
settled in the United States. She renewed her contacts with Heidegger
after the fall of the Third Reich. Arendt respected Heidegger as a
great philosopher, and ignored his dark political side. Heidegger
himself said once to Ernst Jünger that he would only apologize for his
Nazi past if Hitler could be brought back to apologize to him. </p>


<p>From April 1933 to February 1934 Heidegger was Rector of Freiburg,
adding to his letters and speeches the standard "Sieg Heil!"
Heidegger's infamous rectorial address about a "new intellectual and
spiritual world for the German nation" was reported all over the world.
Disappointed with real life politics, Heidegger resigned his post, and
devoted himself to lecturing. He still supported the Nazis, but
gradually lost his faith in the "inner truth and greatness" of National
Socialism. The political authorities had reservations about his
philosophy and he was under surveillance by the Gestapo for some years.
In 1936 he spoke in Rome to a large audience on 'Hölderlin and the
Nature of Poetry'. "... our job is to fight for philosophy in a quiet,
unobtrusive way," he wrote in a letter to Jaspers. During the war
Heidegger resigned in protest from the committee charged with editing
the work of Nietzsche&nbsp;<strong><font size="2">&#8211;</font></strong> he
did not accept the order to remove those passages in which Nietzsche
speaks contemptuously of anti-Semitism. In the late 1944 Heidegger
served in a Volksturm (People's Militia) detachment, but his stay in
the work brigade was short and he returned to Freiburg. </p>

<p>In 1945 Jaspers testified before a de-Nazification commission, that
Heidegger's manner of thinking is in its "essence unfree, dictatorial,
and incapable of communication, would today be in its pedagogical
effects disastrous." Between 1945 and 1951 Heidegger was prohibited
from teaching under the de-Nazification rules of the Allied
authorities. In the spring of 1946, Heidegger had a physical and mental
breakdown. The visit of Jean Beaufret inspired his essay 'On Humanism,'
in which asks what is thinking and states that "for a long time, for
much too long, thinking has been out of its element." Heidegger was
reappointed Professor in 1951 at Freiburg, where he lectured to limited
classes. In his later philosophy Heidegger turned increasingly his
attention to language. In 'Letter on Humanism' (1949) he stated that
"language is the house of being", and in <em>Was ist das&nbsp;</em><strong><font size="2">&#8211;</font></strong><em> die Philosophie?</em>
(1956) he said that the "Greek language and it alone is logos." Poetry
was for Heidegger more important than the other arts. He was especially
fascinated by the works of Hölderlin. "Poetry proper is never merely a
higher mode (<i>melos</i>) of everyday language," Heidegger wrote in
his essay 'Language', dealing with Georg Trakl's poem 'A Winter
Evening.' "It is rather the reverse: everyday language is a forgotten
and therefore used-up poem, from which there hardly resounds a call any
longer." </p>

<p>After the war Heidegger distanced himself from his "philosophical
anthropology," seeing that it described human nature instead of
approaching the nature of things. Like many other thinkers, he argued
that technology has grown beyond control and warned of a technological
understanding of being. Instead of saying "yes" or "no" to technology
he offered a new ideal of letting-be or open-handedness (<i>Gelassenheit</i>);
his answer was "yes" and "no": "We let the technical devices enter our
daily life, and, at the same time, leave them outside, that is, let
them alone, as things which are nothing absolute but remain dependent
on something higher. I would call this compartment toward technology
which expresses 'yes' and at the same time 'no' by an old word&nbsp;<strong><font size="2">&#8211;&nbsp;</font></strong>
open-handedness". In the late 1940s he equalled "the manufacturing of
corpses in gas chambers" with "mechanized agriculture," a senseless
formulation, which has become a standard evidence of his impenitence in
the face of the horrors of Nazism. </p><p>The Jewish poet and a former concentration camp inmate <a href="celan.htm">Paul Celan</a>
in 1967 visited Heidegger's famous cabin in Todnauberg, but what they
talked about is unknown. Todnauberg had been Heidegger's mountain
retreat since the 1920s, a place where Nietzsche's Zarathustra would
have felt comfortable. Celan's entry in the logbook was ambiguous:
"Into the cabin logbook, with a view toward the Brunnenstern, with hope
of a coming word in the heart." In the 1960s Heidegger visited Delos
several times and participated in seminars in Provence. He continued to
write and lecture until his death on 26 May 1976. He was buried in
Messkitch in the local graveyard. <i>Der Spiegel</i>'s interview 'Nur
noch ein Gott kann uns retten,' made in 1966, was published soon after
Heidegger's death. In it he stated: "How can a political system
accommodate itself to the technological age, and which political system
would this be? I have no answer to this question. I am not convinced
that it is democracy." </p>

<p>Heidegger's past has never been forgotten, and the debate about the
relationship between his philosophy and Nazism still continues. Mark
Lilla argued in <i>The Reckless Mind</i> (2001) that Heidegger "was
never able to confront the issue of philosophy's relation to politics,
of philosophical passion to political passion. For him, this was not
the issue; he simply had been fooled into thinking that the Nazis'
resolve to found a new nation was compatible with his private and
loftier resolution to refound the entire traditon of Western thought,
and thereby Western existence." Lilla refers to critics who have seen
in <i>Being and Time</i> a profound hostility to the modern world, and
a program for national regeneration, which indirectly supported
National Socialism. Elzbieta Ettinger portrayed Heidegger as a predator
in her study <i>Hannah Arendt/Martin Heidegger </i>(1995), in which
she used their correspondence. Hans-Georg Gadamer has defended
Heidegger among others in his article 'Züruck von Syrakus' <font size="2">(1988, in </font><i><font size="2">Die Heidegger Kontroverse</font></i><font size="2">)</font>. </p>

<p>To avoid misleading implications, Heidegger invented in <i>Being and Time</i>
a new, meticulous vocabulary, which has made his works somewhat cryptic
for a number of his readers, such as Günter Grass, who parodied
Heidegger's terminology in the novel <i>Dog Years </i>(1963). In <i>The Jargon of Authenticity</i> (1973) <a href="adorno.htm">Theodor Adorno</a>
attacked Heidegger's jargon, which he labelled as pedantic and which
according to Adorno "transforms a bad empirical reality into
transcendence." However, Heidegger's language is not related to
Orwell's "Newspeak" from <i>Nineteen Eighty-four</i> (1949), but is revolutionary compared to the familiar "Oldspeak" of the professorial philosophy. </p>
<p>The central term in <i>Sein und Zeit </i>is Dasein, the German word
for "existence" or "being-there". The meaning of Dasein is temporality;
thus the "Time" in the title of <i>Being and Time</i>. Dasein is not
homo sapiens, but in German usage the term does tend to refer to human
beings. Heidegger was constantly aware that in his task he is a being
whose ways of being are the subject of his work. Dasein implies not
only presence but involvement in the world. In the hermeneutic circle
every interpretation is itself based on interpretation. After
provisional conclusions, based on presuppositions, one returns to the
starting point, to continue the inquiry into deeper understanding in
the circular process of interpretation. The phenomenon of philosophical
phenomenology is the being of beings or entities (das Sein des
Seinden). The being of Dasein is such that Dasein understands its own
being, and at the same time its pre-theoretical understanding makes it
possible to understand the being of entities other than itself. </p>

<p>From Heidegger the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul
Sartre derived his notion of "authenticity". Heidegger himself denied
that he was an existentialist. "My philosophical tendencies," he wrote
in a letter, "cannot be classified as existentialist; the question
which principally concerns me is not that of man's Existenz; it is
Being in its totality and as such." Authenticity in Heidegger was
grounded in the idea, that absolutely all Dasein is characterized by
mimesis. Authentic existence begins from self-understanding and
authentic life is possible if our being-toward-death is resolutely
confronted: "Once one has grasped the finiteness of one's existence, it
snatches one back from the endless multiplicity of possibilities which
offer themselves as closest to one&nbsp;<strong><font size="2">&#8211;</font></strong> those of comfortableness, shirking and taking things lightly&nbsp;<strong><font size="2">&#8211;</font></strong>
and brings Dasein in to the simplicity of its fate. This is how we
designate Dasein's primordial historicism which lies in authentic
resoluteness and in which Dasein hands itself down to itself, free for
death, in a possibility which it has inherited and yet has chosen."
Heidegger writes much about such Dasein moods as irritation, boredom,
and fear; anxiety is at the center of Dasein's life, but it is
noteworthy that he doesn't analyze love or sexuality as fundamental
aspects of human existence. </p>
