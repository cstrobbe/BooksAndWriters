<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American mystery writer, whose works were
especially successful in Europe. Highsmith has explored the psychology
of guilt and abnormal behavior in a world without firm moral ground.
Often her novels deal with questions of fading identity and double
personality. She also published several volumes of short stories in the
fields of fantasy, horror, and comedy. Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Strangers on a Train </i>was based on Highsmith's novel. Her series character, Tom Ripley, has inspired several films. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But the beauty of the suspense genre is
that a writer can write profound thoughts and have some sections
without physical action if he wishes to, because the framework is an
essentially lively story. </b></font><b><i><font size="2">Crime and Punishment </font></i><font size="2">is
a splendid example of this. In fact, I think most of Dostoyevsky's
books would be called suspense books, were they being published today
for the first time. But he would be asked to cut, because of production
costs." </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Plotting and Writing Suspense Fiction</font></i><font size="2">, 1966)</font> </blockquote>

<p>Patricia Highsmith was born in Fort Worth, Texas, but she grew up in
New York. Her parents, who separated before she was born, were both
commercial artists. Her father was of German descent and
she did not meet him until she was twelve &#8211; the surname Highsmith was
from
her stepfather. For much of her early life, she was cared for by her
maternal grandmother. Her great-grandmother Willi Mae was "a Scot, very
practical, though with a great sense of humor, and very lenient with
me," Highsmith later recalled. </p>
<p>Highsmith was educated at Julia Richmond Highschool in New
York and at Columbia, where she studied English, Latin and Greek,
earning her B.A. in 1942. According to some sources, Highsmith spent
some time providing story-lines for the comics after leaving college.
It is believed she worked on scripts for <i>Black Terror</i> and possibly <i>Captain America</i>. </p>

<p>Highsmith showed artistic talent from an early age &#8211; she painted and
remained talented sculptor, but she had determined to be a writer. She
had written as a teenager stories and edited the school magazine at
Barnard College, and after leaving college she worked with comic books,
supplying the writers with plots. Before her first book, Highsmith had
a number of jobs, including that of a saleswoman at a New York Store. </p>

<p>As a writer Highsmith made her debut with <span style="font-style: italic;">Strangers on a Train</span>
(1950). It depicts two men, an architect and a
psychopath, who meet on a train, and "swap" murders. "Any kind of
person can murder. Purely circumstances and not a thing to do with
temperament! People get so far &#8211; and it takes just the least little
thing to push them over the brink. Anybody. Even your grandmother. I
know."<font> (from </font><i><font size="2">Strangers on a Train</font></i><font size="2">) </font>Highsmith developed the idea further in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Blunderer</span>
(1954), where a man's wife dies accidentally but people become
suspicious when he regularly visits another who had murdered his wife.
"Some people are better off dead -like your wife and my father, for
instance," states Bruno, the rich psychopath and proceeds to carry out
his part of the bargain. This work set the tone for her following
novels, in which two different worlds intersect and the border between
normal and abnormal persons is seen vague and perhaps nonexistent. </p>


 

<p>The cunningly plotted melodrama inspired the director Alfred
Hitchcock who made it into film. Both the book and the film are
considered classic in the suspense field. The story has also been
filmed later, in 1969 under the title <i>Once You Kiss a Stranger</i>, directed by Robert Starr. It did not gain much attention, but Danny DeVito' spinn-off <i>Throw Momma From  the Train</i> (1987), which turned the story into black comedy, was better received.</p>

<p>Highsmith's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Price of Salt </span>(1953)
appeared under the pseudonym
Claire Morgan after her publishers had turned it down. The homosexual
love story between a married woman and a shopgirl was in its time
unusual and sold almost million copies. In 1991, the book was reissued
with an afterword under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Carol</span>. Highsmith dealt with sexual minorities  in her other works, and her final novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Small G: A Summer Idyll</span>
(1995), depicted a bar in Zurich, where a number of homosexual,
heterosexual, and bisexual characters are in love with the wrong
people. Highsmith herself had a number of lesbian affairs, but in 1949
she also become close to the novelist Marc Brandel. Between 1959 and
1961, Highsmith had a relationship with Marijane Meaker, who wrote
under the pseudonym M.E. Kerr. </p>

<p>Tom Ripley, Highsmith's most popular character, is a small-time con man and bisexual 
serial killer, who was introduced to the world in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Talentet Mr. Ripley</span> (1955). The critic and awarded mystery writer H.R.F. Keating  included the work in his <i>Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</i>
(1987). In its foreword Highsmith wrote: "I now have a different view
of Cornell Woolrich, thanks to the two pages on him here. Keating
describes <i>The Bride Wore Black</i>, and Woolrich's curious and
indirect methods of laying out his plot and his clues. A homosexual who
apparently lived in the closet, Woolrich shared a life in residential
hotels with a mother whom he both loved and hated. Could anything be
worse?" At the beginning of the story, Ripley is a small-time grifter
in New York, and in the end he is a double murderer. Ripley meets a
worried rich father, whose stay-away son, Richard, lives in Europe. He
is willing to finance Tom's trip to Europe to contact him. In Italy, he
ends up killing his rich friend in a boat at San Remo, and assumes his
identity. Then he kills one of Richard's friends. Without conscience,
Ripley is incapable of remorse. He survives against all odds, like a
strange, new kind of creature. The book was first filmed in 1960 under
the title <i>Plein Soleil</i>
 (Purple Noon), directed by René Clément, starring Alain Delon.
 The likeable amateur murderer Ripley inspired  the Wim Wenders film <i>The American Friend </i>(1977),
starring Dennis Hopper, Bruno Ganz, Samuel Fuller, and Nicholas Ray. In
the story Ripley becomes involved with the Mafia and he uses a
non-professional hit-man, whose fate is sealed. </p>
<p>In Anthony Minghella's film from 1999 Highsmith's homosexual subtext
is not hidden. In the story a millionaire asks Ripley to track down his
son, Dickie, who is living in Italy. The prodigal son and Ripley became
friends, but when Dickie wants to get rid of his new associate, Ripley
starts to lie and kill to continue the high life he has found so
attractive. Dickie vanishes, and Ripley appropriates his identity for
fun, to keep up his lifestyle and to fill the emptiness of his weak
character. </p>
<p>Ripley became Highsmith's most enduring character, who could be a sadist and an understanding husband, a parody of 
upper-class mentality and a criminal only by force of circumstances.   "Murder, in Patricia Highsmith's hands, is 
made to occur almost as casually as the bumping of a fender or a bout 
of food poisoning," wrote Roberts Towers in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. 
The thrill of the novels is based on the problem, how Ripley is going to get away again with his crime. Like Dorian Gray, 
he lives a double life, but 
remains unpunished for his actions. After <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i> the ambivalent hero appeared in several sequels, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">Ripley Under Ground</span> (1970), in which he both masquerades as a dead painter and kills an art collector,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ripley's Game</span> (1974), a story of revenge, in which Ripley is paired with a first-time murderer,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Boy Who Followed Ripley</span> (1980), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ripley Under Water</span>
(1991), the final Ripley adventure, in which Ripley is pursued by a
sadistic American, who knows too much of his past. This time Ripley
doesn't kill anybody. "The feeling of menace behind most Highsmith
novels, the sense that ideas and attitudes alien to the reasonable
everyday ordering of society are being suggested, has made many readers
uneasy. One closes most of her books -- and her equally powerful and
chilling short stories -- with a feeling that the world is more
dangerous than one had imagined."<font size="2"> (Julian Symons in</font><i><font size="2"> The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">October 18, 1992) </font></p>
<p>As a reclusive person, Highsmith spent most of her life alone. "People forget that she was a very 
conservative person," said the American playwright Phyllis Nagy, 
"she wasn't bohemian like Jane Bowles and she did hold some very weird and contradictory 
views." The publisher Otto Penzler, who admired her work and brought her in the mid-1980s to New York, described her as the 
most unloving and unlovable person he have ever known. </p>
<p>In 1957, Highsmith won the French Grand Prix de Litterature
Policiere and the British Crime Writers Association awarded her in 1964
a Silver Dagger. In 1979, she received the Grand Master award by the
Swedish Academy of Detection. Although writing remained her true
passion, she also showed talent as an artist and sculptress. Highsmith
moved
permanently to Europe in 1963, living in East Anglian and France. Her
final years Highsmith spent in an isolated house near Locarno on the
Swiss-Italian border. She never abandoned her Texan background,
dressing in 34-inch-waist Levis, sneakers and neckerchiefs. Highsmith
died in Switzerland on February 4, 1995.</p>

<p>Highsmith's works outside mystery genre include a juvenile book, short 
stories, and non-fiction. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Plotting and Writing Suspense Fiction</span>
(1966) she stated that "art has nothing to do with morality, convention
or moralizing." Several of Highsmith's works fall out from the mystery
genre and her crime novels often have more to do with psychology than
conventional plotting. "Her peculiar brand of horror comes less from
the inevitability of disaster, than from the ease with which it might
have been avoided. The evil of her agents is answered by the impotence
of her patients - this is not the attraction of opposites, but in some
subtle way the call of like to like. When they finally clash in the
climactic catastrophe, the reader's sense of satisfaction may derive
from sources as dark as those which motivate Patricia Highsmith's
destroyers and their fascinated victims." <font size="2">(Francis Wyndham in </font><i><font size="2">Lesbian and Bisexual Fiction Writers</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Harold Bloom, 1997) </font>Russel
Harrison has argued that Highsmith's fiction demonstrates elements of
existentialism as linked to Sartre and Camus, and reflects
sociopolitical concerns to the gay and lesbian issues of 1980s and
1990s. Graham Greene has remarked that the world of a Patricia
Highsmith novel is "claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each
time with a sense of personal danger". </p>
