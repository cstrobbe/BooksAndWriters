<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> Zimbabwean film-maker and writer, whose
novel <i>Nervous Conditions</i> (1988) has become a modern African
classic. It was awarded the Commonwealth Writers' Prize in 1989. Tsitsi
Dangarembga has dealt in her works with the oppressive nature of a
patriarchal family structure and a woman's coming-of-age. "My soul is
African," she once said, "it is from there that springs the fountain of
my creative being." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"This morning I received a letter
from my husband, the first in twelve years. Can you imagine such a
thing? As has been my custom during all this time that I have been
waiting, I opened my eyes at four o'clock when the first cock crowed,
and lay remembering the day that he left, without bitterness and
without anger or sorrow, simply remembering what it was like to be with
him one day and without him the next."</b> (from 'The Letter', 1985) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Tsitsi Dangarembga was born in Mutoko in colonial Rhodesia,
but at the age of two she moved with her parents to England, thereby
citing English as her first language &#8211; it was used all through her
education and she forgot most of the Shona that she had learnt. In 1965
she returned to Rhodesia, where she entered a mission school in Mutare
and learned Shona again. She then completed her secondary education at
an American convent school. In 1977 Dangarembga went to Cambridge to
study medicine. After three years she abandoned her studies and
returned to Zimbabwe, where amongst other things she worked for some
time at an advertising agency, and started to study psychology at the
University of Zimbabwe. </p>
      <p>During these years she became involved with the Drama Club and
wrote and staged three plays, <i>She No Longer Weeps </i>(pub. 1987),
      <i>The Lost of the Soil</i>, and <i>The Third One</i>. "The
writers in Zimbabwe were basically men at the time," she said in an
interview. "And so I really didn't see that the situation would be
remedied unless some woman sat down and wrote something, so that's what
I did!" Upon graduation she worked as a teacher, but finding it
difficult to combine an academic career and literature, then devoted
herself entirely to writing. Her short story, 'The Letter' won a price
in a writing competition arranged by SIDA, the Swedish International
Development Authority, and was published in the anthology <i>Whispering
Land </i>(1985). In it Dangarembga drew a parallel between broken
family ties under South African apartheid with national disintegration.
The narrator, a woman, receives the first letter from her husband &#8211;
after twelve years. He had been considered a security risk but manages
to escape before being arrested. Her mother tells her to destroy the
letter, but she wants to save it. Soldiers raid her house and she is
taken to a police station. The story ends with a brutal conclusion: "As
for myself, well, I have already told you that I became a political
person twelve years ago in the Township. Therefore I have been ample
time to get used to the aberrations of people in the grip of
totalitarian fervour. I do not know what is going to happen to me. I
may be charged with an act of treason plotted in Pretoria, or they may
hold me here to abuse me physically and mentally for a while before
conceding that my desire to be with my husband is not grounds for
indictment." </p>
      <p>As a novelist Dangarembga made her debut with <i>Nervous
Conditions</i>,
a partially autobiographical work. The novel was rejected by a number
of Zimbabwean publishers on the grounds that it was unrepresetative of
African women and their interest. Eventually it was published in
Great Britain in 1988 by The Women's Press, and the next year in the
United States. She had
already began to write in her childhood, and read mostly the English
classics, but the period following Zimbabwean independence inspired her
to read contemporary African literature and the writings of
Afro-American women. "I personally do not have a fund of our cultural
tradition or oral history to draw from," she once confessed, "but I
really did feel that if I am able to put down the little I know then
it's a start." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"...if at the age of twenty-six
somebody has a story to tell it's likely to be about growing up! Also
I'm always conscious at the back of my mind that there is very little
that a woman in Zimbabwe can pick up &#8211; in Zimbabwe today </b></font><font size="2"><b>&#8211;</b></font><font size="2"><b> and say yes,
I know, that's me&#8230;.Because I know I felt that gap so dreadfully..." </b>('Tsitsi
Dangarembga' by Jane Wilkinson, in </font><i><font size="2">Talking
with African Writers</font></i><font size="2">, 1992) </font></blockquote>
      <p>The title of <i>Nervous Conditions</i> is borrowed from
Jean-Paul Sartre's introduction to Franz Fanon's <i>Wretched of the
Earth</i>. The "nervous condition" of the native is, according to
Sartre, a function of mutually reinforcing attitudes between colonizer
and colonized that condemn the colonized to what amounts to a
psychological disorder. Tambudzai Sigauke, the narrator, looks back on
her childhood in colonial Rhodesia of the sixties and seventies,
beginning her narration with the famous opening: "I was not sorry when
my brother died." Tambu's brother is sent to a mission school, but the
family don't have money for her education. She grows maize to earn her
own school fees, only to have her brother steal her produce. Also her
father attempts to claim the money because he doesn't believe that the
education of women is important. When his brother dies Tambu enters the
school &#8211; the family does not have any other sons. She becomes friends
with her cousin Nyasha, who has spent five years in England and who
refuses to conform to society's expectations for women. Gradually Tambu
leaves behind those parts of her family, herself and her culture that
she cannot accept &#8211; an analogue of the independence process of
Zimbabwe. She also rejects her highly educated uncle, Babamukuru, who
believes that Tambu's education will enable her to marry well. When
Babamakuru's authority becomes increasingly irrational, Tambu sees that
she must free herself from the dichotomy between tradition and
modernity: the struggles women face are similar, regardless of their
class. "Quietly, unobtrusively and extremely fitfully, something in my
mind began to assert itself, to question things and refuse to be
brainwashed, bringing me to this time when l can set down this story.
It was a long and painful process for me, that process of expansion. It
was a process whose events stretched over many years and would fill
another volume, but the story I have told here, is my own story, the
story of four women whom I loved, and our men, this is how it all
began..." </p>
      <p>The international recognition<span style="font-style: italic;"> Nervous Conditions</span> received did not only demonstrate the validity of Dangarembga's
feminist approach in an African context but also encouraged other
Zimbabwean writers to tackle issues of gender inequality as well.
Following her success as a novelist, Dangarembga turned her
attention to film. After receiving a Commonwealth Writers' Award, she
left for Berlin to continue her education at the Deutsche Film und
Fernseh Akademie, where she studied film direction and produced a
documentary for German television.
She returned eventually to Zimbabwe with her two children, born in
Germany. "Life is difficult in Zimbabwe at the moment, but my soul
breathes more freely here," she said. In 1990 Dangarembga was
commissioned to write the story for <i>Neria </i>(1992), which became
the highest-grossing film in Zimbabwean history. The protagonist is a
widowed woman, whose brother-in-law uses her difficult situation for
his own advantage. Neria loses her material possessions and her child,
but gets then help from her female friend against her former husband's
family. </p>
      <p>In 1992 Dangarembga founded Nyeria Films, a film production
company in Harare. Her films have received several awards. <i>Kare
Kare Zvako</i> (2005) was the winner of the Golden Dhow in Zanzibar,
and won also the Short Film Award Cinemaafricano in Milano, and Short
Film Award ZIFF. <i>Peretera Maneta</i> (2006) received the UNESCO
Children&#8217;s and Human Rights Award and won the Zanzibar International
Filmfestival. With <i>Everyone's Child</i> (1996), shot on location in
Harare and Domboshawa, Dangarembga made film history in her country. It
was the first full lenght feature movie directed by a black Zimbabwean
woman. The story follows the tragic fates of four siblings, Tamari and
Itai, after their parents die of AIDS. The soundtrack featured songs by
Zimbabwe's most popular musicians, including Thomas Mapfumo, Leonard
Zhakata and Andy "Tomato Sauce" Brown. Dangarembga herself has also
served on the board of the Zimbabwe College Of Music for five years,
two of them as chair. <span style="font-style: italic;">Nyaminyami and the Evil Eggs</span> (2011), based on the legendary river god of the Zambezi valley, was the second in a trilogy of folktale musicals after <span style="font-style: italic;">Kare Kare Zvako</span>. <br>
 </p>
      <p><i>The Book of Not</i> (2006), set against Zimbabwe's struggle
for freedom from white rule, continued the semi-autobiographical story
of Tambu at the Sacred Heart academy. Tambu is not a traditional
likeable heroine of a Bildungsroman: now her faults and failures
overshadow her virtues and accomplishments. She even volunteers to
contribute to the Rhodesian war effort by knitting for the white
soldiers. At the end Tambu seems to have learned little from her
experiences of injustice, except that selfishness and suppressing of
rage have not helped her to achieve the greatness that is inside of
her. Again Tambu's opposite character is her cousin Nyasha, whose
reading of Ngugi's <i>A Grain of Wheat </i>only prompts Tambu to
respond with a sarcastic comment from her warped perspective. </p>
      <p>Concerned about the state of the nation, Dangarembga joined
the Movement For Democratic Change (MDC), led by Deputy Prime Minister
Arthur Mutambara, and was named in 2010 the secretary for education in
a portfolio reshuffle. "I have not always been a vocal critic of
President Mugabe&#8217;s government," she explained in an interview. "I have
always been a vocal critic of injustice, backwardness, intolerance,
brutality, selfishness, greed, you name it &#8211; all the things that are
listed in the bible as deadly sins." <font size="2">(newZimSituation.com,
23rd Jun 2010)</font>
Dangarembga has completed her doctoral studies in the Department of
African Studies at the Humboldt University Berlin. Her Ph.D. thesis
will deal with the reception of African film. </p>
