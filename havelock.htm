<P> English essayist, psychologist, a pioneer in establishing a modern, scientific approach to the study of sex. Ellis's magnum opus was <I>Studies in the Psychology of Sex </I>(7 vols., 1897-1928). Until 1935 his work was legally available only to  the medical profession. Ellis became known as a champion of women's rights and of sex education, but  his autobiography <I>My Life</I> (1939) reveals his marital problems and unhappiness in his own sexual life. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;All advance in social reform, even when it involves surgery, is, and always has been, effected by heroic pioneers who are ready to act, and even, if need be, to become martyrs. They slowly win the world to their side. The law limps behind.&quot; </B>(from </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">Questions of Our Day</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, 1934) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Henry Havelock Ellis was born in Croydon, Surrey,  the son of Edward Peppen Ellis, a sea captain, 
and Susannah Mary (Wheatley) Ellis. He was educated at private schools in London. At the age of sixteen 
he made a voyage to Australia in a ship under his father's command. He worked there as a teacher in 
New South Wales, where he underwent an inner transformation. Later Ellis returned to this experience 
in the novel <I>Kanga Creek</I> (1922) and his autobiography: &quot;Yet there has never been a moment 
when the foundation and background of my life have not been marked by the impress they received at 
Sparke's Creek.&quot; After four years, he returned to England. Ellis entered St. Thomas' Hospital, 
London, where he studied medicine from 1881 to 1889. However, after qualifying he practiced only 
for a short time. In 1891, Ellis married the English writer Edith Lees; he was still a virgin. 
From the beginning, their marriage was unconventional – the wedding breakfast consisted of porridge and at the end of the honeymoon, Ellis went back to his barchelor rooms in Paddington. Edith lived at Fellowship house. Their stormy relationship was the central subject in Ellis's autobiography, <I>My Life</I>. None of Ellis's four sisters ever married. &quot;If men and women are to understand each other,&quot; Ellis once said, &quot;to enter into each other's nature with mutual sympathy, and to become capable of genuine comradeship, the foundation must be laid in youth.&quot; </P>
<P>In 1883 Ellis met the South African writer <A HREF="/schrein.htm">Olive Schreiner</A>. He did not aswer to her expectations, but they remained close friends until her death in 1920. &quot;We were not what can be technically, or even ordinarily, called lover,&quot; Ellis said later. In <I>On Life and Sex: Essays of Love and Virtue</I> (1921) Ellis referred to Schreiner's    <I>Woman and Labour</I> (1911) and her theory that modern society produces a tendency to parasitism  in women: &quot;...they no longer exercise the arts and industries which were theirs in former ages, and so they become economically dependent on men, losing their energies and aptitudes, and becoming like those dull parasitic animals which live as blood-suckers of their host.&quot; The letters of Schreiner and Ellis were published in 1992. It has been speculated that their relationship was unconsummated. Ellis suffered from impotence until he was about 60. With the help of a devoted lover, he finally cured the problem, and remained sexually active until he was 72. &quot;I am regarded as an authority on sex, a fact which sometimes amused one or two (though not all) of my intimate women friends,&quot; Ellis wrote in his autobiography. </P>
<P>During his time as a medical student, Ellis began writing for magazines, and become a staff member of the <I>Westminster Review</I>. At the meetings the Fellowship of the New Life  Ellis met G.B. Shaw (1856-1950) and other progressive thinkers, but when Shaw was attracted by Socialism and collective action, Ellis focused on the  problems of individuals. However, Edward Carpenter's poem <I>Towards Democracy </I>(1883-1902), about the march of humanity toward socialism, inspired Ellis so much, that he sent Carpenter a letter, which started their long friendship. In 1887 he became editor of the Mermaid Series of unexpurgated reprints of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. He worked on this project with such writers as Arthur Symons (1865-1945), A.C. Swinburne (1837-1909). His first work of nonfiction, <I>The Criminal </I>(1890), appeared in the Contemporary Science Series, which he edited until 1914. 
 In 1894 he published <I>Man and Woman</I>, which was translated into many languages. Around 
the turn of the century he experimented with the hallucinogen mescal,  preceding Aldous 
Huxley who also studied hallucinogenic substances. Yeats, who was also interested in the 
relationship between dreams, visions, and drugs, co-operated in the trials. However, he expressed 
preference for hashish. The first result was 
an article, 'Mescal: a new artificial Paradise' published in the <I>Cotemporary Review</I> in 
1898, and then another, 'Mescal: a study of a divine planet' (1902). 

</P>
<P>Ellis's increasing concern with sexual matters let to <I>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</I>. 
It appeared in six volumes from 1897 to 1910. A seventh volume was published in 1928. The work 
explored sexual relations largely from a biological and multicultural perspective.  Especially 
Ellis was interested in the typical sexual behavior of humans, paving way to the surveys of 
Alfred Kinsey and other modern writers on sexual topics. He objected Freud's application of 
adult sexual terms to infants, and tried to demystify human sexuality – most of his English 
readers were raised in the asexual, ignorant, and prejudiced Victorian climate. Masturbation, he assured his readers, did not inevitably lead to serious illness.
 Ellis 
himself liked to watch women urinating. Once he persuaded his lover Fran&#231;oise Cyon to do so in Oxford Circus. &quot;I think almost all civilized people are in some way what would be thought abnormal,&quot; said Bertrand Russel in his <I>Autobiography</I> after reading Ellis's work, &quot;and they suffer because they don't know that really ever so many people are just like them.&quot; </P>
<P><I>Sexual Inversion</I> was published in Germany in 1896 under the title <I>Das kontr&#228;re Geschechtsf&#252;hl.</I> When the book appeared in Britain, George Bedborough, the bookseller, who had stocked it, was prosecuted, and a British judge declare the <I>Studies</I> obscene. Just a few years earlier Oscar Wilde had been condemned for the crime of sodomy. In his work Ellis had presented some 80 cases of homosexual males, concluding that homosexual behavior was not a disease or a crime.  The subsequent volumes of the <I>Studies </I>were published in the United States  by F.A. Davis Company in Philadelphia. The seventh volume, <I>Eonism and Other Supplementary Studies</I>, appeared in 1928. After the ban was lifted, Random House produced to general readers a four-volume series of the work. The last years of his life Ellis spent in retirement near Ipswich, is Suffolk. Ellis died on July 8, 1939 in Hintlesham, Suffolk. Havelock Ellis's library was purchased by Yale University in 1941. The FBI also has files on Ellis. </P>
<P>With <I>The Task of Social Hygiene</I> (1912) Ellis participated in the discussion about  eugenics – he supported 
it strongly 'the science and art of Good Breeding in the human race': &quot;Eventually, it seems evident, a general 
system, whether private or public, whereby all personal facts, biological and mental, normal and morbid, are duly 
and systematically registered, must become inevitable if we are to have a real guide as to those persons who 
are most fit, or most unfit to carry on the race. Unless they are full and frank such records are useless.&quot; 
Thus Ellis did not condemn Nazi sterilization programmes, because they had scientific premises and &quot;need 
not become mixed up in the Nordic and anti-semitic aspects of Nazi aspiration.&quot; 
<FONT SIZE="2">(in </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">Studies in the Psychology of Sex</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, vol. 
6, 1937)</FONT> Ellis also wrote on such authors as Casanova, Nietzsche, Henrik Ibsen, Walt Whitman, 
and Leo Tolstoy. His essays on French writers were collected under the title <I>From Rousseau to 
Proust</I> (1935). A new edition of <I>The Soul of Spain</I> (1908), with an introductory essay 
on the Spanish Civil War, appeared in 1937. His  critical pieces from 1884 to 1932 on literature and art were 
reprinted in <I>Views and Reviews</I> (1932). Thousands of people  wrote Ellis asking him for 
advice on sexual matters. His correspondence he utilized in <I>My Confessional</I> (1934), a collection of essays. </P>
