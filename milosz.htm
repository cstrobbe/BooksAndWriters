      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Polish-American author,
translator
and critic, who was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1980. Mi&#322;osz's poetry and essays are a mixture
of autobiographical confessions dealing with the effects of exile,
religious or metaphysical
fragments, historical and literary analyses. Though acclaimed as a
Catholic
poet,&nbsp;<font size="-1"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></font>Mi&#322;osz
had also a strong pantheist element in his work.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'When Poland achieved independence
in 1918 there were endless debates about a Polish Academy of Letters
until finally it was called into existence, but not without some wild
clashes. It established a Youth Prize, and when Stanislaw Pietak was
awarded it in 1938, Boleslaw Micinski, who was in France at the time,
wrote to his mother in the mock Russian he used when he wanted to be
funny, "It vood hev bin bedder hed Milosz gut prize."</b>' (in </font><font size="-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mi&#322;osz</span></font><font size="2"><i>'s
ABS's</i>, 1997) </font> </blockquote>
      <p>Czes&#322;aw Mi&#322;osz was born in Szetejnie, a rural town in
Lithuania, then under the domination of the Russian czarist government.
Both of his parents, Aleksander, a civil engineer, and Weronika (née
Kunat), descended from the native Lithuanian nobility, which had
assumed a Polish identity. Between 1914 and 1918, Aleksander served in
the Imperial Russian army, erecting bridges and fortifications behind
the lines and traveling with his family throughout Russia. </p>
      <p>In <i>Native Realm</i> (1959) Mi&#322;osz described his birth
region as a land largely forgotten by history: "For many centuries,
while kingdoms rose and fell along the shores of the Mediterranean and
countless generations handed down their refined pleasures and vices, my
native land was a virgin forest whose only visitors were the few Viking
ships that landed on the coast." After WW I <font size="-1"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></font>Mi&#322;osz's family settled in
Wilno, where he had a strict Roman Catholic education. "In a Roman
Catholic country," Mi&#322;osz wrote at an early stage of his career,
"intellectual freedom always goes hand in hand with atheism." Later
Mi&#322;osz accepted his religious background and began to study Hebrew in
order to render the Old Testament into Polish. </p>
      <p>Mi&#322;osz received his master of laws degree from the University
of Wilno in 1934, and then spent a year in Paris. There he formed a
close relationship with his distant uncle, Oscar Mi&#322;osz (1877-1939),
who was a diplomat and has also made his name as a French poet.
Mi&#322;osz's first collection of verse,&nbsp; <em>Poemat o czasie zastyglym</em>,
came out in 1933. It was followed three years later by <em>Trzy zimy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>In 1936 he worked at a radio station in Wilno, but was
dismissed the following year because of his leftist views. Mi&#322;osz then
moved to Warsaw, where he was hired to work at Polish Radio. He soon
became a leading figure of the Zagary group, whose catastrophism,
belief in an upcoming cosmic disaster, reflected Spenglerian ideas of
cultural life-cycles. Later he returned to the theme of the decline of
European civilization in <i>The Land of Ulro</i> (1977). And the
prophesied disaster came &#8211; first in 1939 when German invaded Poland and
World War II broke out</p>
      <p>The heated literary debates
of the group were carried in Wilno and Warsaw periodicals. Mi&#322;osz
condemned purely aesthetic trends in literature. He
attacked on the formalism of the poetic avantgarde in the name of
poetry that look at the world from a subjective point of view. Mi&#322;osz's
early works also show traces of distaste for any
form of nationalism, anti-Semitism, and ideological indoctrination.
"What is poetry which does not save / Nations or people?" he asked. </p>
      <p>During World War II Mi&#322;osz was active as a writer in the
Polish Resistance movement under the pseudonym Jan Syruc. After
escaping from Wilno and settling in the Nazi-occupied Warsaw he worked
as a janitor in the university library. To support himself, he also
turned to some black market trading. In 1942 brought out a translation
of Jacques Maritain's <i>À travers le désastre</i> and an anti-Nazi
anthology of poems, <i>Piesn niepoldlegla </i>(Invincible Song). For
an underground theater he translated Shakespeare's<i> As You Like It</i>.
Though Eliot's sarcasm in<i> The Waste Land</i> was alien to his
vision, he translated for an underground publisher the work, filled
with images of collapsing cities. In 1944 Mi&#322;osz married Janina Dluska,
whom he had met while working for the radio; they had two sons. After
suffering from Alzheimer's disease for ten years, she died in 1986.
Mi&#322;osz's second wife was Carol Thigpen, a historian and former
associate dean for the College of Arts and Sciences at Atlanta's Emory
University. She died in 2002. </p>
      <p><em>Ocalenie</em> (1945), a collection of verse, impressed so
the new Communist government that he was appointed junior diplomat as a
non-party intellectual.Between 1946 and 1951 Mi&#322;osz was in the Polish
diplomatic service in Washington D.C., where he wrote 'Traktat
moralny', and in Paris. While in Warsaw on holiday in 1951, his
passport is taken away. When the passport was returned, Mi&#322;osz returned
to France and sought political asylum. In&nbsp; <em>Zniewolony umysl</em>
(tr. <i>The Captive Mind</i>, 1953), which appeared after Milosz left
Poland, he revealed the problems of intellectuals living under
Stalinism. He saw that there is some dark magnetic force in
totalitarian ideology, to which intellectuals were not immune. Between
the years 1951 and 1960 Mi&#322;osz lived in Paris. Because of his
association with the Communist
Polish government, he was denied a U.S. visa. During these years he
published <em>Traktat Poetycki</em> (1957), one of his major works, in
which Milosz argues that poetry is essential for every human community
wanting to survive as a community. <span class="st"><em>Dolina Issy</em>
      </span>(1955, The Issa Valley) was a novel dealing with the
author's childhood in Lithuania.<em><strong> </strong></em><span class="st"><em>Zdobycie wladzy</em> </span>(1955), The Seizure of
Power) was about life in Warsaw after a change in power. Mi&#322;osz also
edited and translated into Polish a selected writings of Simone Weil. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The exile of a poet, is today a
simple function of a relatively recent discovery; that whoever wields
power is also able to control language, and not only with the
prohibition of censorship, but also by changing the meaning of words." </b>(in
        <i>Nobel Lecture</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Mi&#322;osz moved in 1960 to the United States, working there as a
professor of Slavic languages and literature at University of
California at Berkeley
(1960-78). In 1970 he took U.S. citizenship. Though he continued to
write poetry in Polish, he also published many works in English. "I
belong to those whose thinking is very closely connected with their
language," he once said in an interview. "For that reason, I remained,
so to speak, protected by a cocoon of my language, which I acquired as
a child." His new home country Mi&#322;osz viewed ironically: "What
splendor! What poverty! What humanity! What inhumanity! What mutual
good will! What individual isolation! What loyalty to the ideal! What
hypocrisy! What a triumph of conscience! What perversity!" <font size="-1">(in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mi&#322;osz</span></font><font size="2"><font style="font-style: italic;" size="-1">'s ABC's</font>) </font></p>
      <p>Mi&#322;osz is not easy to read &#8211; his essays are dense and reflect
his
search for the essence of man and the painful lessons of modern
history. Repeatedly he has tried to find meaning behind fleeting
moments of life. At the age of 25 he asked: "O my love, where are they,
where are they going / The flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle
of pebbles. / I ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder." And in another
poem written over 70 years later, he confesses resignated to God: "Now
You are closing down my five senses, slowly, / And I am an old man
lying in darkness. / Delivered to that thing which has oppressed me /
So that I always ran forward, composing poems." Mi&#322;osz believes in the
redemptive power of art and treats
it as a "moral discipline." Sartre's attack on Camus &#8211; he hesitated to
criticize Stalinism when Camus did not separate Fascism and Communism &#8211;
was something that he did not want to forget. Without any compromises,
Mi&#322;osz has considered Russian Communism "a decidedly antihuman system."
In Poland Mi&#322;osz's moral stand made him a voice of conscience during
the
Cold War period.</p>
      <p>After his defection Mi&#322;osz's works were banned in Poland. In
California Milosz's poetry became more introspective but he did not
abandon his eschatological visions. Mi&#322;osz's other later writings
include essays, autobiography, literary history, and translations from
such authors as Alexander Wat and Anna Swirszczynska.
When he returned to his native land shortly after he was honored with
the Nobel Prize, he received a hero's welcome. He was given an honorary
doctorate from Lublin Catholic University and in Gdansk he met with
Lech Walesa and other leaders of the Solidarity movement. However, when
martial law was declared in Poland by Prime Minister Jaruzelski, most
of his work was again banned. </p>
      <p>Mi&#322;osz settled in Kracow in 2000, where his 90th birthday was
widely celebrated in 2001. In addition to the Nobel prize, he received
European Literary Prize (1953), Kister Award (1967),
Neustadt International Prize (1978), National Medal of Arts (1989).
He was also appointed member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
and American Institute of Arts and Letters. Mi&#322;osz's<i> The History of
Polish Literature</i> (1969) is perhaps the best introduction to Polish
literature in English. Milosz died at his home in Kracow on August 14,
2004. The Russian poet Joseph Brodsky once said: "I have no hesitation
whatsoever in stating that Czeslaw Mi&#322;osz is one of the greatest poets
of our time, perhaps the greatest." When a monument was erected in
Gdansk to those who had died there, it bore a fragment of his poem
'Który skrzywdziles' (You Who Have Wronged). </p>
