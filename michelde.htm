<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->French courtier and author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Essais</span>
(1572-80, 1588), which established a new literary form. Montaigne has
remained the greatest exponent of the essay, a short piece that
discusses the author's personal thoughts about a particular subject.
His successors have followed him in the use of the self as subject, the
replacement of logical thought by free association, and the use of
essay as "a literary device for saying almost everything about
anything" (Aldous Huxley). It has been said, that Montaigne was the
first blogger. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"And though nobody should read me, have I
wasted time in entertaining myself so many idle hours in so pleasing
and useful thoughts? In moulding this figure upon myself, I have been
so often constrained to temper and compose myself in a right posture,
that the copy is truly taken, and has in some sort formed itself;
painting myself for others, I represent myself in a better colouring
than my own natural complexion. I have no more made my book than my
book has made me: 'tis a book consubstantial with the author, of a
peculiar design, a parcel of my life, and whose business is not
designed for others, as that of all other books is." </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">The Essays of Montaigne</font></i><font size="2">, tr. Charles Cotton, ed. William Carew Hazlitt, 1877) </font> </blockquote>
<p>Montaigne was born at his family estate in Chãteau de Montaigne,
near Bordeaux, in southwest France. His grandfather, Ramon Eyquem, had
bought the estate of Montaigne in 1477, and thus gained the right to
its name. Montaigne's father, a lawyer, had served as a soldier in
Italy and adopted advanced views about education, which benefited his
son. He had married Antoniette de Lopez, who came from a Spanish Jewish
family converted to Protestantism. As a baby Montaigne was sent to live
with a peasant family so that his earliest memories would be of humble
surroundings. He was brought up to speak Latin before French. </p>
<p>After receiving his early education at the Collège de Guyenne in
Bordeaux, he then studied law at Bordeaux and Toulouse. He was a
counselor of the Court des Aides of Périgueaux, in 1557 he was
appointed councilor of the Bordeaux Parliament, and from 1561 to 1563
he was at the court of Charles IX. When his friend Etienne de la Boëtie
died in 1563 at thirty-two, Montaigne suffered the most severe
emotional experience of his life. Thereafter he never had a close
relationship. </p>
<p>In 1565 Montaigne married Françoise de la Chassaigne, with whom he
had one daughter; four other children died in infancy. After his
father's death in 1568, he retired to the family Chãteau in 1570. He
lived there the life of a country gentleman, and completed in the
following years the first books of his <i>Essais</i>, which reflected
his wide interests and learning. Montaigne's first book of collected
essays was published when he was 47. He argued that the beliefs of
different cultures should be respected, and covered in his texts a huge
range of subjects, including how to converse properly, how to endure
pain, how to prepare for death, how to read well, how to bring up
children, and how to deal with the sexual urge. </p>
<p>Even his cat did not escape his watchful attention: "When I play
with my cat, who knows whether she isn't amusing herself with me more
than I am with her?" Montaignes's voice is skeptical and sincere; "I am
myself the subject of my book; it is not reasonable to expect you to
waste your leisure on a matter so frivolous and empty". Occasionally he
made incursions into the world of affairs. As a moderate Roman Catholic
and advocacy of toleration, he acted as one of the intermediaries
between Henry of Navarre (1589 &#8211; assassinated 1610) and the court
party. However, in 1588 he was arrested by the members of the
Protestant League, but released after a few hours in the Bastille.
During this journey he met Marie Le Jars de Goyrnay, a young woman.
Montaigne was flattered by her admiration of his work, and called her,
perhaps somewhat ironically, his <i>fille d'alliance</i>. "She is the only person I still think about in the world," Montaigne said in the 1595 edition.</p>
<p>From 1578 Montaigne had suffered from kidney stones. This led him in
search of curative waters. In 1580 he set out on travels through
Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, meeting Torquato Tasso at Ferrara. At
the beginning of May 1581, he spent some time at Bagno della Villa,
recording in his journal his daily routines, baths and medicines he
took, and what he had for dinner. In 1581 Montaigne was elected mayor
of Bordeaux. He was still in Italy and on the occasion Henry III (1551
&#8211; assassinated 1589) wrote to him: "Inasmuch as I hold in great esteem
your fidelity and zealous devotion to my service, it has been a
pleasure to me to learn that you have been chosen mayor of my town of
Bordeaux. I have had the agreeable duty of confirming the selection,
and I did so the more willingly, seeing that it was made during your
distant absence; wherefore it is my desire, and I require and command
you expressly that you proceed without delay to enter on the duties to
which you have received so legitimate a call. And so you will act in a
manner very agreeable to me, while the contrary will displease me
greatly." Montaigne served for four years, he absented himself from his
duties only at a time of plague. In 1588 he accompanied Henry III to
Rouen and spent the last years in revising his writings. Montaigne died
on September 13, 1592, at Château Montaigne. He was buried near his own
house. A few years his remains were removed to the church of a
Commandery of St. Antoine at Bordeaux. </p>
<p>The practical and self-centered world-view of the Renaissance was
manifested in the autobiographical writings of Cellini and Montaigne,
the historical analyses of Machiavelli, and Leonardo's drawing of the
Vitruvian man. Montaigne was the first to use the term 'essay' to
describe the literary form to which he had devoted himself &#8211; "the
dialogue of the mind with itself" as the poet and critic Matthew Arnold
said. Montaigne's <i>Essais</i> had great influence not only in France, but also in England, where his works were quoted by William Shakespeare 
and imitated by Francis Bacon, who used the new term in his<i> Essays and Counsels, Civil and Moral</i>
(1596).</p>
      <p>Basically Montaigne's self-centerness was the cause why his
work was placed in 1676 on the Vatican&#8217;s index of prohibited books; the
ban was lifted in 1854. When he playfully argued that penis has its own
rebellious nature, stronger than human will, he stepped on the toes of
the church: "We are right to note the licence and disobedience of this
member which thrusts itself forward so inopportunely when we do not
want it to, and which so inopportunely lets us down when we most need
it; it imperiously contests for authority with our will: it stubbornly
and proudly refuses all out incitements, both mental and manual." In
'Sur des vers de Virgile' (On Some Verses of Virgil) Montaigne
complains of the <i>scripteur</i>'s small penis. </p>

<p> No real models existed for Montaigne's essays. His literary
apprenticeship had been slight: his only early noteworthy publication
had been a work of translation. There is a profound affinity between Lucretius, an Epicurean materialist and the writer of<span style="font-style: italic;"> De rerum natura</span> (On the Nature of Things),
and Montaigne, who owned a copy of the book and filled it with his
notes. However, Montagne was not so much interested in the underlying
pattern or order behind nature but the&nbsp; manifold of appearances. <br>
</p>
      <p>Montaigne's purpose in his essays was
self-knowledge: "The greatest thing in the world is to know how to
belong to oneself." But the self one finds in his writings is not
narcissistic, although he admitted: "Painting myself for others, I
represent myself in a better colouring than my own natural complexion."
Montaigne gives room for dialogue, addressing his thoughts to the
potential reader, and combining the form of a letter with the form of a
dialogue with an ideal friend. Later the French philosopher René
Descartes (1596-1650) developed Montaigne's unsystematic thoughts into
their logical conclusion in his famous "Cogito; ergo sum" (Je pense,
donc je suis; I think, therefore I am). </p>
