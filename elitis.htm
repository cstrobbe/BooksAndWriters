      <p>Greek poet and winner of the 1979
Nobel Prize for Literature. Elytis's poems are written in rich
language, full of images from history and myths. The lines are long and
musical. Inspired by the 'sanctity of the perceiving senses' Elytis
celebrated in his early poems the mystery of the Greek light, the sea,
and the air. Later themes are grief, suffering, and search for a
paradise. </p>

      <p>Odysseus Elytis (Odysseas Alepoudhelis) was born in Iráklion,
Crete, into a prosperous Cretan family. He was the sixth child of Maria
and Panayiotis Alepoudellis. His parents and ancestors came
from the island of Lesbos, home of the ancient Greek poet Sappho. From
there the family business moved to Athens.
Elytis's father died of pneumonia in 1925. Following a nervous
breakdown Elytis spent two months in bed. <br>
      </p>
      
      <p>After attending the Makris Private School, he entered Athens
University, where he studied law from 1930 to 1935 without
taking a degree. Periodically he worked in the family's soap
manufacturing business. Inspired by Freudian theory, French Surrealism and especially <a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/eluard.htm">Paul Éluard</a>, Elytis started to write verse. All his poems, which he had written during this period, he destroyed in 1934. <br>
</p>
      <p>Elytis's first poems appeared in 1935 in magazine <i>Ta Nea Grammata</i>, which
also published <a href="seferis.htm">George Seferis'</a>s works<font face="Symbol">-</font>he
won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1963. The poet Andreas
Empeirikos, who had recently returned from France and was close to the
French surrealistic circle, became Elytis's lifelong friend. Along with
Empeirokos and the painter Stratis Eleftheriadis-Teriade he traveled to
Lesbos, where he was involved in the discovery and promotion of the art
of the folk painter Theophilos Hadjimichael (1897-1934). <i>Orientations
      </i>(1940),
Elytis's first collection, combined themes of Eros
and beauty with the timeless nature of the Aegean world: "Love / The
archipelago / And the prow of its foam / And the seagull of its dream" <font size="-1">(from 'Of the Aegean')</font>. <br>
 </p>

      <p>During WW II when Nazis occupied Greece, Elytis joined the
resistance movement and served as a second lieutenant in Albania in
1940-41. After a long campaign, he contracted typhus. <i>Asma iroiko
ke penthimo ghia ton hameno
anthipolochago tis Alvanias</i> (1943, Heroic and Elegiac Song for the
Lost
Second Lieutenant of the Albanian Campaign) was published during the
Nazi occupation of Greece. Elytis's joyful
visions of youth and the sun-drenched Aegean nature had changed into
acknowlegmenet of violence and sudden death. The
hero of the poem is killed on the battlefield and miraculously
resurrected throught
his youth and heroism. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As a young man he had seen gold
glittering and gleaming on the shoulders of the great </b></font><b><font color="White" size="2">-</font><font size="2">And one night </font><font color="White" size="2">-</font><font size="2">he remembers </font><font color="White" size="2">-</font><font size="2">during a great storm the
neck of the sea roared so it turned murky </font><font color="White" size="2">-</font><font size="2">but he would not submit it </font></b></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>The world's an oppressive place to
live through </b></font><b><font color="White" size="2">-</font><font size="2">yet with a little pride it's worth it." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from Death and Resurrection of Constandinos
Paleologhos') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Like
many other leftist intellectuals, Elytis was denied a passport during
the&nbsp; civil war between communists and royalistst.He wrote critics
for the newspaper <i>Kathimerini</i><i> </i>and
worked for the National Broadcasting Institute in Athens
in 1945-46 and again 1953-54.&nbsp; When he was given permission to
travel outside the country in 1948, he moved to Paris, where he
studied literature at the Sorbonne. During this time he became
acquainted with Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and other figures of the
Parisian art scene. </p>
      <p>In 1953 Elytis returned to Greece and took an active role in
cultural affairs. He was a member of the Greek critical and
prize-awarding Group of the Twelve, and served as president and
governing-board member of Karolos Koun's Art Theater and of the Greek
Ballet. His silence as a poet ended in 1959 with <i>To Axion Esti</i>,
reminiscent of <a href="wwhitman.htm">Walt Whitman</a>'s <i>Song of
Myself</i>,
which celebrated the diversity of American landscapes and people. It is
believed, that Elytis was proficient enough in English to read Whitman
while in France.<br>
</p>
      <p>The work took him 14 years to write; it was later set
music by Mikis Theodorakis. Inspired by the Byzantine liturgy, Elytis
combines the biblical story of the creation with modern Greek history.
In this work the poet identifies himself in the first section,
'Genesis', with the sun and the entire Aegena world and his race. In
the second, 'The Passion,' he passes through the barbaric war decade,
comparing humankind's suffering with the suffering of Christ.
Eventually, like Dante in <i>Paradise</i>, he sees the sun, love, and
beauty. "If there is, I think, for each one of us a different, a
personal Paradise," Elytis once said, "mine should irreparably be
inhabited by trees of words that the wind dresses in silver, like
poplars, by men who see the rights of which they have been deprived
returning to them, and by birds that even in the midst of the truth of
death insist on singing in Greek and on saying, eros, eros, eros!"" </p>

      <p>Between
1965 and 1968 Elytis served on the administrative
board of the Greek National Theater, and then spent the next two years
in Paris after the Greek military coup of 1967. The dictatorial
government offered him the Grand Prize for Literature, but he refused
the
honour. In 1978 he published a
long poetic work, <i>Maria Nefeli</i>, which was finished when he
returned to Greece. Its alternating monologues are spoken by a girl,
Maria Nephele and the Antiphonist, the poet himself. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Much of his life,
Elytis spent in semiseclusion, focusing only on his art, but after the
Nobel Prize followed a period of busy traveling. Elytis never married;
during his last years his companion was the poet Ioulita Iliopoulou.
Elytis died of a heart attack on March 18, 1996. His collected poems
came out posthumously in 1997. Elytis was also a talented painter and
produced illustrations of his lyrical world in gouaches and collages. </p>
