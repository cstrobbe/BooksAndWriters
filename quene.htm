<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French poet, novelist, and publisher, a precursor of postmodernism. Raymond Queneau's internationally best-known novel, <i>Zazie dans le métro</i>
(1959), was made into a successful film in 1960, directed by Louis
Malle. Queneau often used in his novels and poems colloquial speech and
phonetic spellings. After World War II his work formed a bridge between
the irrational world of <a href="../../../abreton.htm">Breton</a> and other surrealists and the philosophical 'absurd' of existentialism. </p>

<font size="2">(from 'Vieillir') </font></blockquote>

<p>Raymond Queneau was born at Le Havre, the son of Auguste Queneau, an
ex-colonial soldier, and the former Jeanne Mignot. His parents owned
and&nbsp;ran a haberdashery.&nbsp;Queneau&nbsp;once said that his
childhood "wasn't much fun" and in the 1930s he underwent
psychoanalysis, "which wasn't much fun either." &nbsp;</p><p>Queneau
was educated at the lycée in Le Havre and in 1926 he graduated from
Sorbonne. While working as a bank clerk, he began to write. Between the
years 1924 and 1929, Queneau was active in the surrealistic movement.
Their manifest, <i>Permettez!</i>, composed by Queneau, was signed by
the entire group, but later he broke with them. When Arthur Rimbaud's
statue was inaugurated in 1927, Queneau cited for the horror of the
public the works in which Rimbaud expressed his contempt for the
Church, the famous 'French taste,' and culture. </p>
<p>In 1934 Queneau married Janine Kahn; they had one son. He became in
1938 a reader for Gallimard and from the late 1940s he was the
principal editor of the Gallimard <i>Encyclopédie de la Pléiade</i> and histories of literature published in the Pléiade series. Throughout his life, he contributed to newspapers and journals. <i>Le Monde</i> referred to him as "one of the most universal minds of our time." In 1952 he was elected to the Goncourt Academy.</p>
<p>Queneau collaborated with a number of 'New Wave' film directors.
Juliette Greco made popular his song 'Si tu t'imagines.' Although
Queneau has been called the creator of <i>le noveau roman</i> a generation ahead of its time, in <i>Le vol d'Icare </i>(1968,
The Flight of Icarus) he also parodied among others one of the central
writers of the movement, Alain Robbe-Grille. In 1960 a group of leading
French writers and mathematicians founded The Ouvrior de LittÈrature
Potentielle, the Oulipo, and Queneau became one of its writers. Other
Oulipians have been Calvino, Perec, Roubaud, Mathews. Queneau died on
October 26, 1976.&nbsp;By nature, he was essentially a secretive
writer, but in his early works he used a considerable amount of
autobiographical matter, including <em>Chêne et chien</em> (1937), a verse novel. Queneau's<em> Journal 1939-1940</em>,
which was published in 1986, reveal a man concerned with spiritual
self-transformation, who finds inspiration in neo-Platonist thought,
Chinese philosophy, and Christian mysticism. </p>
<p>From a very early age Queneau was interested in language. During his
military service in North Africa in 1925, he found out that he did not
understand the ordinary language of the ordinary French soldier. Years
later he visited Greece and became involved in discussions about the
differences between classical and demotic Greek. He saw that modern
written French must free itself from the conventions of style,
spelling, and vocabulary that date from the sixteenth and seventeenth
century. His first book, <i>Le chiendent </i>(1933, The Bark Tree),
Queneau began to write on his journey in Greece in the summer of 1932;
Robbe-Grillet has called it the first real New Novel. The story,
structured on mathematical principles, was set in Paris and dealt with
a search of an immense sum of money. <i>Le chiendent</i> was noted for
its slangy use of language and is considered Queneau's best. Its title
has many meanings, but in parts of North America <i>chiendent</i> is known as witch grass. </p>
<p>Language was not for Queneau simply a means of expression. He argued
that the real subject of his work is language itself. Many's of
Queneau's novels and poems are very difficult to translate <font face="Symbol">-</font> they are experimental, based on spoken French, and play with words, spelling, puns, and slang. <i>Zazie</i>
starts with the word 'Doukipdonktan' which is a phonetic transcription
of 'D'où est-ce qu'ils puent donc tant?' (What part of them is it that
stinks so much?). <i>Si tu t'imagines </i>(1952) contains most of Queneau's central poems. The work has been noted for its <a href="../../../jjoyce.htm">Joycean</a> wordplays and neologisms. <i>Cent mille milliards de poèmes</i>
(1961, One Hundred Million Million Poems), which consists of a set of
ten sonnets in separate 14 strips, fused mathematic with poetry. It is
possible to construct one hundred trillion poems from its lines. </p>

<p>Queneau's novels portrayed&nbsp;unpretentious ordinary people,
characters from margins of society, and such urban locales as metro
stations, small cafés, suburban cinemas. Occasionally he played with
the conventions of the gangster genre.&nbsp;<i>On est toujours troup bon avec les femmes</i>
(1947, We Always Treat Women Too Well ), a thriller set
in&nbsp;Dublin&nbsp;that never was, first appeared under the covers of
"Editions du Scorpion," in the wake of James Hadley Chase's <em>No Orchids for Miss Blandish</em>, and Boris Vian's&nbsp; <em>J'irai cracher sur vos tombes</em>
(I Spit on Your Grave), both of which enjoyed great success in France,
but Queneau's novel did not reach out to the masses. He deliberately
turned the basic situation of Chase's novel&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> a young helpless woman at the mercy of psychopaths&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> upside down: now she seduces&nbsp;her kidnappers, a group of IRA men, and destroys them. </p><p><em>Pierrot mon ami</em>
(1942) was a detective story, perhaps without a crime. Queneau has
noted that in the American crime novel writers are no longer concerned
with the puzzle as much as with the characters. The detective story has
become existentialist in the journalistic sense. In <i>Loin de Ruel</i> (1944) the protagonist turns into the hero of films he sees <font face="Symbol"><font face="Symbol">-</font></font> like Buster Keaton in <i>Sherlock, Jr. </i>(1924) or much later the young movie fan in Arnold Schwarzenegger's underrated <i>Last Action Hero </i>(<i></i>1993). </p><p><i>Exercices de style </i>(1947)
explored linguistic conventions. Queneau presented ninety-nine
different versions of a single, totally insignificant anecdote <font face="Symbol">-</font>
a man gets on a crowded Paris bus, Route 'S', sees a youngish man
complain that his fellow-traveller is stepping on his feet. When he
sees a vacant seat he throws himself on to it. Later Queneau sees the
same man talking to a friend on a street <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the friend says: 'You ought to get an extra button on your overcoat,'
and shows him where. The story is told among others as an official
letter, as a blurb for a novel, as a sonnet, and in 'Opera English.'
Queneau creates ninety-nine times a different atmosphere with
inventive, different choice of words, and makes the reader to pay
attention to the manner in which a story is told. 'At the hour when the
rosy fingers of the dawn start to crack I climbed, rapid as a tongue of
flame, into a bus, mighty of stature and with cow-like eyes, of the
S-line of sinuous course.'<font size="2"><b> </b>(Noble style) </font>Queneau's work has inspired Matt Madden's graphic novel <span style="font-style: italic;">99 Ways to Tell a Story: Exercises in Style</span>
(2005), in which a man gets up from his computer, walks into his
kitchen, speaks to his wife and opens his refrigerator, only to
discover that he can't recall what he was looking for.<br>
</p>

<p>In <i>Zazie dans le métro</i> a young girl comes to Paris for a few
days. Zazie spends time with her heterosexual uncle Gabriel, who works
as a dancer in a gays' night-club. After finishing his act, a lady says
to Gabriel, 'You were so amusing!' <font face="Symbol">-</font> and he
answers, 'Don't forget the art in it, though. It's not just amusing,
it's also art.' Zazie has an obsession: she wants to ride on the <i>métro</i>. But the <i>métro</i>
workers are on strike and she crisscrosses Paris in a cab, taking part
in a series of farcical events, and making rude comments on the
grown-up silliness. Her favorite expression is 'my ass.' Again Queneau
writes in a semiserious way and uses widely dialogue, meaningless
everyday language, swearwords, and phonetic spelling <font face="Symbol">-</font>
Zazie drinks 'cacocalos' and wears 'bloudjinnzes.' When her mother
comes to collect her, she asks 'did you see the métro?' 'No', 'What did
you do, then?', 'I grew up.' The novel was adapted for the screen by
Louis Malle in 1960. Pauline Kael described the film in<i> The New Yorker </i>as
'bold, delicate, freakish, vulgar, outrageous and occasionally
nightmarish.' Malle played with the conventions of film like the author
had played with language.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Up till now he had always thought that
language ought to formulate the truth, and silence hide it. The words
he would use to Madame Saphir's customers, male and female, it wouldn't
even be zones of error that they would form, but zones of confusion in
which illusion might remain in suspense until the end of a life. </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Sunday of Life</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p><i>Le Dimanche de la vie</i> (1951, The Sunday of Life) was Queneau's tenth novel, cheerful as the later <i>Zazie,</i>
and it also gained popularity as a film. The central figure is Valentin
Brû, ex-Private, whom Queneau follows during the period of 1936-40. In
the sardonic story Valentin is selected by two sexually-frustrated
older women as the ideal mate. He marries Julia, but she is busy with
hordes of customers. 'Have to admit, said Julia, have to admit that a
marriage without a honeymoon, that doesn't exist.' The book contained
one of Queneau's most famous words, 'Polocilacru,' meaning 'Paul aussi
l'a cru' (Paul believed it too). <font face="Symbol"></font>Another new fine word, translated by Barbara Wright, is 'somnodribblin.' </p>
