      <p>Vietnamese statesman, Communist leader, and Confucian
humanist, who led the country's struggle for independence in the 1940s
and was a major figure in the war between North and South Vietnam in
the 1960s. Ho Chi Minh devoted his life to the revolution and cause of
communism. Like <a href="/mao.htm">Mao Zedong,</a> he emphasized the
revolutionary potential of the peasantry, but unlike the Chinese
leader, Ho was know for his Gandhian modesty and aestheticism in his
private life. Among Ho's most famous literary works is his <i>Prison
Diary</i>. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Innocent, I have now endured a</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">whole year in prison.</font><br>
        <font size="2">Using my tears for ink, I turn</font><br>
        <font size="2">my thoughts into verses. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Autumn Night', in </font><i><font size="2">Prison Diary</font></i><font size="2">, translated by Aileen
Palmer) </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Ho Chi Minh was born on Nguyen Sinh Cung in the village of
Kimlien, Annam &#8211; later he was given the name Nguyen Tat Thanh, "he who
will succeed." Ho came from a poor scholar-gentry family. His father,
Nguyen Sinh Sac, was a teacher and civil servant, who was dismissed
from his office for refusing to serve at court. Hoang Thi Loan, Ho's
mother, died when Ho was eleven. After attending schools in Vinh and
Quoc Hoc College in Hué, Ho left his studies and taught at a private
school in Phan Thiet, a fishing village in South Annam. Ho's wandering
years began in 1911, when he decided to leave French Indo-China
(Vietnam). He traveled to Saigon and found employment on a French
passenger liner <i>Amiral Latouche-Tréville</i> as a kitchen help. He
then worked in London (1915-17) and Paris (1917-23) in odd jobs, among
others as a pastry cook at the Carlton Hotel in London. He also spent
some time in the United States. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ho's pamphlet, <i>La Race Noire</i>, which was published in
Moscow in 1924, was partly based on his experiences during his trips in
1914-1916. It is believed, that he lived in Harlem for a while, and visited Boston, and East and Gulf Coast ports. The
American actress Mae West has told in an interview, that she met "Ho...
Ho... Ho something" at the Carlton. "There was this waiter, cook, I
don't know what he was. I know he had the slinkies eyes though. We meet
in the corridor. We &#8211; well..." </p>
      <p>In his years at sea, Ho read such writers as Shakespeare,
Tolstoy, Marx, and Zola. He greeted with enthusiasm the Russian
Revolution and after World War I he joined the French Socialist Party.
Lenin's <i>Theses on the National and Colonial Questions</i> impressed
him deeply and in 1920 he participated in the Committee of the Third
International. He also was one of the founders of the French Communist
Party and published writings on colonial issues in the Marxist
periodical <i>Le Paria</i> (The Outcast), and contributed articles to
the newspaper <i>L'Humanité. </i>Like Lenin, he believed that
nationalism was a trap that lured colonized peopled away from class
struggle. "If you do not condemn colonialism, if you do not side with
the colonial people, what kind of revolution are you waging?" Ho Chi
Minh asked. </p>
      <p>By
August 1922 the French government ordered the French secret police to
follow Ho's movements. As a response said an open letter to
Albert-Pierre Sarraut, minister for the colonies: "If Your Excellency
insists on knowing what we do every day, nothing is easier: We shall
publish every morning a bulletin of our movements, and Your Excellency
will have but the trouble of reading." <br>
</p>
      <p>Ho journeyed in 1923 to the U.S.S.R. to study Marxism and
revolutionary techniques. In Moscow Ho became a member of the
Comintern's Southeast Asia Bureau. In 1924 he moved as an agent of the
Comintern to Canton, China, where he helped to organize the
revolutionary forces and lectured on politics and ideology. These
lectures were published in a book form under the title <i>The
Revolutionary Path</i> (1927). According to some sources, Ho allegedly
married Tang Tuyet Minh in China in 1926 under the name Nguyen Ai Quoc
(Nguyen the Patriot). <br>
      </p>

      <p>After Chiang Kai-shek turned on his Communist allies, Ho fled
to Moscow by the way of Gobi. In the late 1920 Ho's political
activities took him to Europe, and in 1928 he spent some time in Siam
(Thailand) disguised as a Buddhist monk. In 1930 he was again in China
and established in Hong Kong the Communist Party of Vietnam. He was
arrested in 1931 by the British police, and after he was released in
1933, he escaped back to the Soviet Union in the disguise of a Chinese
merchant. The French had already sentenced him to death in absentia in
1930. </p>
      <p>Before returning to Vietnam, Ho worked with Chinese
communists. At the age of fifty, he crossed the Vietnam-China border,
but his stay in his native country did not last long. During the early
1940s Ho adopted the pseudonym Ho Chi Minh &#8211; meaning roughly "he who
enlightens." He was arrested in China in 1942 and jailed for over a
year. From this period dates his <i>Prison Diary</i>, which consists
of politically and ideologically orthodox poems. "Physically I'm
suffering / But my spirit will never flinch" he said in one of the
poems. In prison Ho lost his teeth and his hair turned grayer. </p>
      <p>When the Japanese 'occupation' ended in 1945, the Viet Minh
independence movement took over Hanoi. Ho proclaimed the birth of the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the declaration of independence,
which was partly based on his recollections of the American Declaration
of Independence. It started with the words, "All men are created equal;
they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights;
among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness." In 1946
he was appointed President. During the following years Ho led the
anti-French resistance &#8211; the Viet Minh was dominant in the countryside,
and the French controlled the large cities. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The turning point of the war come in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu,
where the stronghold built by the French troops was crushed &#8211; a triumph
of guerilla strategy and patience. "It is a glorious victory of our
people, and also of the oppressed people in the world," Ho later said.
The French Government signed an armistice, and subsequent negotiations
divided Vietnam along the 17th parallel. In Hanoi President Ho Chi Minh
refused to settle in the governor general's residence, and for some
time he lived in the electrician's cottage and then in a modest house
on stilts. The title he preferred in his old age was Uncle Ho. Usually
Ho Chi Minh dressed in high-necked white garment, called a cu-nao, and
wore open-toed rubber sandals. He was a chain-smoker, especially he
loved American-made Salems. </p>
      <p>The North adopted the socialist system, and following Maoist
policies a brutal land reform was carried out. Although Ho was opposed
to the worst excesses, an estimated 50,000 people died and about
50,000-100,000 were imprisoned<font size="2"> (from <i>Le livre noir
du communisme</i>, by Stéphane Courtois et. al, 1997). </font> Freedom
of speech was restricted. From 1959 arms and guerrillas moved down the
Ho Chi Minh Trail into the south. Eventually The Trail comprised twelve
thousand miles of roads and paths. The United States, supporting Ngo
Dinh Diem and the Saigon regime in the South, was gradually drawn into
the war against the People's Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF), of which
the Americans used the term Viet Cong, an abbreviation of <i>Viet-nam
Cong-san</i> (or Vietnamese Communists). Hanoi was repeatedly bombed by
American planes. In the 1960s, the conflict created a world wide
protest movement and the rhythmic chant 'Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh' became an
essential part of the peace marches. </p>
      <p>Ho resigned from his position as the party's secretary-general
in 1959. Due to his poor health, his role was largely ceremonial, as
the symbol of Vietnamese communism. The active conduct of the war was
done by the collective leadership he had established. "Is the Statue of
Liberty standing on her head?" Ho Chi Minh asked once from his American
visitor. In 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote a letter to Ho, in
the hope that the conflict in Vietnam can be brought to an end. Ho
answered: "The Vietnamese people will never give way to force, it will
never accept conversation under the clear threat of bombs." <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ho Chi Minh died of heart failure on September 3, 1969, in
Hanoi. In his testament Ho wrote: "All my life, I have served the
Homeland, the revolution and the people with all my heart and strength.
If I should now depart from this world, I would have nothing to regret,
except not being able to serve longer and more. When I am gone, a grand
funeral should be avoided in order not to waste the people's time and
money." The war ended in 1975, Vietnam's reunification was officially
proclaimed next year, and Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. <br>
      </p>
      <p>President Ho Chi Minh's massive Mausoleum in Hanoi, where his
embalmed corpse rests, was completed in 1975. The embalming was done by
the Soviet Dr Sergei Debrov; it took a full year to complete the
process. Mao's body was embalmed without Soviet help. When the Soviet
Union collapsed, old Comintern files in Moscow were opened, but thus
far historians have not found much inflammable material on Ho. William
J. Duiker claims in his biography on Ho Chi Minh, that Ho married
twice, and in Hanoi he fathered a child. </p>
