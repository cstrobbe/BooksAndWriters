      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p>Latvian poet, essayist, translator and novelist, called in her
own country "the conscience of her time and her nation." Bel&#353;evica was
frequently mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in literature. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"Rome like a jealous wife
demands<br>
That love be sworn to her in public<br>
At every step... With spying eyes she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; reads<br>
Between my lines, that she owns not<br>
This heart, once so naive and yielding."<br>
        </strong>(from 'The Notations of Henricus de Lettis in the
Margins of the Livonian Chronicle', translated by Baiba Kaugara) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Vizma Bel&#353;evica was born in Riga of working-class parents. She
grew up in Riga and Ogale, where she became intrested in writing. In
her memoirs Bel&#353;evica told that her father was an alcoholic and her
mother emotionally cold.&nbsp;During her adolescent years, Bel&#353;evica
was an active member of the Komsomol&nbsp; (Communist Youth League).
Latvia was incorporated as a constituent republic of the USSR in 1940.
Germany occupied the country from 1941 but the USSR regained control
1944. </p>
      <p>After vocational school and technicum, Bel&#353;evica entered in
1955 the Gorky Institute in Moscow, finishing her literary studies in
1961. Her debut as a poet Bel&#353;evica made in the 1940s. In some of her
early poems, she praised the Soviet Union, willingly, believing in its
ideals. Bel&#353;evica's world view was shattered in 1956
by&nbsp;Khrushchev's famous&nbsp;speech, in which&nbsp;he denounced
Stalinism and "the cult of personality". She took luminal pills and
wanted to die. </p>
      <p>Bel&#353;evica's first collection, <i>Visu ziemu &#353;ogad pavasaris</i>,
was published in 1955, but it was not until <i>Jura deg</i> (1966),
when she started to find her own inner form of expression after inner
struggles and reflections. In the Soviet Latvia, Bel&#353;evica was among
those writers who did not glorify the Soviet regime and follow the
rules of the socialist realism. With such poets as Ojárs Vácietis,
Imants Ziedonis, Máris Caklais, and Mára Zalite, she constantly
tested the limits of censorship. The literary journal <i>Karogs</i>
(Flag), which publisher many of their early poems, was known for its
struggle with the authorities, who allowed some formal experimentation
after Stalin's death. However, all signs of national thought were
suppressed. </p>
      <p>Although Bel&#353;evica's criticism was veiled, she was often
prohibited from publishing her work. In 1969 her <i>Gadu Gredzeni </i>sold
within hours 16,000 copies when it appeared in the bookshops. In the
poem 'Indrika Latvie&#353;a piezimes uz Livonijas hronikas malam' (1969)
Bel&#353;evica suggested similarities between the imperialism of Rome and
the Soviet policies. Accused of pseudomonernist tendencies and false
interpretation of historical&nbsp; facts, she was silenced for almost
ten years. The only official institution interested her work was the
KGB. Bel&#353;evica's politically outspoken son Klavs Elsbergs, also a poet
and translator, died in 1987 under suspicious circumstances by falling
out of a Soviet Writers' Union building. His younger brother Janis,
born in 1969, gained fame as a poet under the pen-name Janis Ramba. </p>
      <p>Bel&#353;evica's poems, which managed to pass the censorship, were
widely translated in the Soviet Union. In 1983 a special concert was
arranged in her honor. Bel&#353;evica uses simple images and contrast&nbsp;&#8211;
fire and water, trees and bird, silence and scream, but they have rich
symbolic meanings. "Winds rage. Winds howl. Riga is silent. / Silent
are the naked stone women." <font size="2">(from 'A Latvian History
Motif: Old Riga', translated by Astrida B. Stahnke)</font> In the
collections <i>Madaras</i> (1976) and <i>Dzeltu laiks</i> (1987)
Bel&#353;evica identified womanhood with nature and the earth, and found
harmony in family life and altruism. Some of these themes she had also
dealt in short stories. They often center on strong women and have the
form of monologue.</p>
      <p>In 1995 Bel&#353;evica published the first part of her
autobiographical work, <i>Bille</i>, dealing with her childhood in the
1930s. It was followed by <i>Bille dzivo talak</i> (1996), about the
German and Russian occupation of Latvia seen through the eyes of a
child, and <i>Billes skaista jauniba</i> (1999), about the post-war
years and the first great love of a young girl.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"Vizma Bel&#353;evica is a love
poet, capable of seeing what is typical and universal in what is unique
and personal. The aim of her demanding love is the same as that of the
Renaissance masters&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> a love that remains
unappeased&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> not only that but it can only be
expressed in imagery which is laconically harsh and concrete."</strong>
(from <i>History of European Literature</i> by Annick Benoit-Dusausoy,
2000) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Bel&#353;evica also wrote screenplays and translated English
(Hemingway, Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, A.A. Milne), Russian (Pushkin) and
Ukrainian literature into Latvian. In 1990 she was appointed honorary
member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences. Bel&#353;evica<b> </b>received
several awards for her work, including the Swedish Irma and Einar
Forseth Foundation Literary Prize in 1992 and Tomas Tranströmer prize
in 1998. Bel&#353;evica died in Riga on August 6, 2005, after a long
illness, which had kept her wheelchair-bound for the last years of her
life. Her poems have been set to music by the well-known composer and
piano player Raimond Pauls, who&nbsp;also had a prominent career in
politics. </p>
