<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Writer, journalist, and playwright, whose 
best-known novel,&nbsp;<em>Zavist' </em>(1927,
Envy) painted a prophetic picture of the clashing values in the early
years of the Soviet Russia. Writing in expressionistc style, Olesha's
work differed radically from the school of the Socialist Realism. When
the authorities realized that Olesha was more ambiguous than was
permissible, he fell from favor. After Stalin's death, Olesha was
rehabilitated. <blockquote><font color="white" size="2"><b>-</b></font><b><font size="2">"How
sweet is my life ... ta-rá! ta-rá ... my bowels are flexing ...
rá-ta-tá-ta-ra-rí ... the juices are flowing just right, straight
through ... ra-tí-ta-doo-da-tá ... squeeze, bowels, squeeze ...
tram-ba-ba-boom!"</font></b><font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">Envy</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>


<p>Yury Olesha was born in Elizavetgrad, Ukraine, into a middle-class
family. His father, Karl Antonovich,&nbsp;was an excise officer, an
impoverished member of the gentry. In 1902 the family moved to the
cosmopolitan port of Odessa, where Karl Antonovich was employed as as
a&nbsp;tax inspector&nbsp;in a vodka distillery. According to Olesha,
he should have avoided drinking himself: "... I do remember an episode
when he put me on a windowsill and aimed a revolver at me. He was
drunk, and Mama fell down on her knees, pleading with him to 'stop
that.'" His early education Olesha&nbsp;received at home, where his
Polish grandmother taught him Russian and mathematics.&nbsp;His
contemporaries have recalled that he always spoke Russian with an
imperceptile Lithuanian accent. In 1908&nbsp;Olesha&nbsp;entered
Rishelevskii gymnasium, graduating in 1917 with a gold medal in
language and literature. He then studied law for two years at
Novorossiikii University, Odessa. </p><p>Olesha
began to write verse under the influence of Alexander Blok and Igor
Severyanin. His ballad called 'Clarimonda' appeared in the newspaper<em> The Southern Herald</em>.
In Odessa he participated in the activities of the Green Lamp,
a&nbsp;literary discussion group, and the politically engaged literary
circle, the Poets Collective, whose members also included <a href="ilf.htm">Ilya Ilf</a>. With Valentin Kataev he was inseparable. Kataev portrayed later his bohemian&nbsp;friend&nbsp;in <em>My Diamond Wreath</em> (1978).

</p><p>Olesha's sister Wanda died of typhoid in 1919, at the height of
civil strife in Ukraine. Rejecting his parents' monarchist sympathies,
Olesha joined the Red Army for a year, serving&nbsp;as a telephonist in
a Black Sea naval artillery battery.&nbsp;While working as a
propagandist at the Bureau of Ukrainian Publications in Kharkov, he
published his first story in the Kharkov newspaper <em>Proletarian</em>.</p><p>In 1922 Olesha&nbsp;went to Moscow, where he was employed by the railway journal <i>Gudok</i>, 
which had such writers as <a href="babel.htm">Isaak Babel</a>, and <a href="ilf.htm">Ilf</a>
and Petrov. "... my job consisted of stuffing envelopes with letters
written by the section head to the various addresses of the worker
correspondents," he later recalled. Olesha soon became&nbsp;a leading
member of the editorial staff. His columns he published under the
pseudonym of Zubilo (the Chisel). However, f<span class="st">inding it difficult to adjust himself</span>
to boring routines, Olesha spent more&nbsp;time writing in restaurants
than in his office. One of his favorite places was&nbsp; a Georgian
restaurant on Tverskoi Bulevard, opposite the Telegraph Building.
&nbsp;
</p><p>In the 1920s Olesha published&nbsp;satirical verses, which
became very popular,&nbsp;and sharp, critical articles. He stressed the
freedom of expression, saying "The invisible realm is the adobe of
attention and imagination. In it the wayfarer is not alone; two sisters
walk at his side, leading him by the hand; they are Attention and
Imagination." </p><p>Olesha's famous novel <i>Envy</i> appeared ten years after the Revolution and created an sensation. This ambiguous 
work was first printed in the literary magazine <i>Red Virgin Soil</i>
in 1927. It tells the story of a Nikolai Kavalerov and two brothers,
Andrei and Ivan Babichev. Andrei, who represents the rising
generation,&nbsp;is a hero of the Revolution, the trade director of the
Food Industry Trust, and an inventor of a sausage machine. Kavalevov,
who&nbsp;
longs for personal fame, envies his success. He allies with Ivan, a
romantic dreamer and opponent of the new age, against Andrei. When
their plans fail, they&nbsp;take refuge in a boarding house run by a
fat widow. And as the narrator in Dostoevskii's novel <i>Notes from Underground</i>, Kavalerov is pushed 
to the margins of society. The stage adaptation of <i>Envy</i> was entitled <i>A Conspiracy of Feelings</i>
(1929). In&nbsp;the original ending Kavalevov lapses into a stupor and
is denounced by Ivan as a worthless museum piece, "the man whose life
was stolen away," but in the staged version, Kavalevov murders Ivan,
instead of Andrei. It took still some time, before critics and party
officials began to suspect, that Olesha had&nbsp;drawn a parallel
between&nbsp;the automated sausage production&nbsp;and Communist ideals
&#8211; whether it was the case or not. </p>

<p><i>Envy</i> was followed by <i>The Three Fat Men</i> (1927), where
the circus stars Tibul and Suok are leading the people to over throw
repressive authorities.&nbsp;This widely popular novella&nbsp;was made
into a play (1930), produced by Konstantin Stanislavsky at the Moscow
Art Theater, a ballet (1935), an opera (1956), a radio drama, and it
has been filmed several times.&nbsp; Olesha's only original play, <em>A List of Assets</em> (1931) was staged by Vsevolod Meyerhold in Moscow. </p><p>A&nbsp;dawdler
by nature and working in general very slowly, Olesha published little
after the early 1930s. In 'The Cherry Stone,' which appeared in a
collection of short stories in 1930, Olesha confessed his confusion:
"Comrade driver, believe me, I am a mere amateur, and cannot tell you
what turn to take." The central theme of the story was the conflict
between artistic imagination, the world of metaphors,&nbsp;and everyday
reality.&nbsp;Olesha translated Turkmen and Ukrainian authors
and&nbsp;wrote film scenarios for such films as<em> Bolotnye soldaty</em> (1938, Swamp Soldiers), dealing with Nazi prison camps, <em>Oshibka inzhenera Kochina</em> (1939, Engineer Kochin's Mistake), directed by Aleksandr Macheret, and <em>Malen'kii leitenant</em> (1942, The Little Lieutenant). </p><p>Eventually&nbsp;Olesha
withdrew from the public eye, though&nbsp;he defended the need for an
independent literature and artistic autonomy&nbsp;before the First
Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934. Olesha&nbsp; revealed the feelings
he underwent as he found himself incapable of writing until he had
"established a common ground" with the new Soviet man. Responding to
accusations that the three most talented Soviet writers of the period,
Babel, Olesha, and Pasternak, had been slow in producing new books,
Ilya Ehrenburg said that a writer's output should not be judged by the
standards applicable to construction work. <br>
</p>
      <p>Following this&nbsp;famous speech
his name gradually vanished&nbsp; from the pantheon of Soviet
literature for a period. The dominating aesthetic doctrine known as
Socialist Realism was formulated more or less by Maxim Gorky, who was
chosen chairman of the Writers' Union. <i>Envy</i>
was condemned for its "reactionary" stylistic tendencies.&nbsp;At the
peak of Stalin's purges in 1937 Olesha was accused of "antihumanism".
Pasternak and Olesha were mentioned among those intellectuals who were
allegedly plotting a political diversion. <br>
      </p>


<p>During World War II Olesha was evacuated with the Odessa Film Studio
to Ashkhabad in Turkmenistan. After the war he returned to Moscow,
where he constantly moved with his wife from one small apartment to
another. In 1954 they were given an apartment in the writer's building
on Lavrushinsky Lane. Olesha's only noteworthy theatre piece during his
later years was an adaptation of Dostoevskii's <i>The Idiot</i>
for the Vakhtangov Theatre. Other works included a stage adaptation of
Chekhov's 'Tsvety Zapozdalye'&nbsp;(1959), which was made into a movie
in 1970,&nbsp;and a screenplay for a children's cartoon, entitled <em>A Girl in the Circus</em>. Olesha died of a heart attack on May 10, 1960.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was&nbsp;married to Olga Gustavovna Suok. 
Their stepson Igor, committed suicide by jumping out of a window in front of both Olesha and Olga. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Exploring the principles of composition
and the struggle of the writer to find a place in the new society,
Olesha's work powerfully dramatized the dilemma of the literary
intelligentsia in a society that increasingly regarded creative
independence with suspicion. If his work represents the epitome of
fellow-traveller poetics, then his critical reception in Russia also
reveals the attitude of officialdom towards those writers." </b>(Craig Brandist in 'Iurii Karlovich Olesha, 1899-1960', </font><i><font size="2">Russian Literature</font></i><font size="2">, ed.&nbsp; Neil Cornwell, 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p>The publication of a selection of his stories, <em>Izbrannye sochineniia</em>, signaled Olesha's rehabilitation in 1956, three years after Joseph Stalin's death. Posthumously&nbsp;came out the&nbsp;
autobiographical <em>Ni dnia bez strochki: Iz zapisnykh knizhek</em>
(1965, No Day Without a Line), a collection of fragments in more or
less thematic order, dealing with such subjects as "the family,"
"Richelieu Gymnasium," "the circus," "Odessa," and "literary figures,"
and so on. &nbsp;"There was something Beethovesque about Yuri Olesha,
something mighty, even in his voice," said the writer Konstantin
Paustovsky. "His eyes spotted many marvellous things around him, and he
wrote about them tersely, precisely, and well." </p>
