<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English poet, dramatist, critic, and short
story writer, married to the American poet <a href="splath.htm">Sylvia
Plath</a>, who committed suicide in 1963. Hughes stated that poems,
like animals, are each one "an assembly of living parts, moved by a
single spirit." In his early works Hughes questioned man's function in
the universal scheme. Seriously interested in shamanism, hermeticism,
astrology, and the Ouija board, Hughes examined in several of his later
animal poems the themes of survival and the mystery and destructiveness
of the cosmos. </p>

      <p>Edward James Hughes was born in Mytholmroyd, Yorkshire, but
raised in Mexborough, a coal-mining town in South Yorkshire. The harsh
landscape of the northern England moors had a strong influence in
Hughes's poetry. From his earliest days he was hooked on fish, though
the river by which he grew up was polluted by chemicals. His parents
were warm-hearted people &#8211; his mother was famous for her jams and
gooseberry pies; his father was a carpenter, who later turned news
agent. He had participated during World War I in the battle of
Gallipoli, and was one of the 17 who survived from his regiment. </p>
      <p>After studies at the Mexborough Grammar School, Hughes served
two years in the Royal Air Force. From grammar school he won a
scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied first
English and then switched to archaeology and anthropology. One night he
had a dream in which he saw a fox appearing in his room. It placed a
bloody pawn on the blank page in front of him, and said, "Stop this.
You are destroying us." Hughes specialized in mythological systems,
which provided much material for his poetry. He graduated in 1954 and
settled in London, where he worked as a zoo attendant, gardener, and
script reader for J. Arthur Rank. </p>
      <p>In Cambridge Hughes founded with his friends a literary
magazine <i>St Botolph's Review</i>. At a student party he first saw
an unknown poet, Sylvia Plath. The meeting anticipated their tumultuous
relationship &#8211; she bit him on the cheek, so hard that it bled. They
married within a few months; possibly it was Sylvia who proposed. In
1957 the couple moved to the US. Hughes taught English and creative
writing at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Disgusted with
American culture and mass-produced luxury, he wanted to return to
England; "I'd rather eat mud than live in America", he said. For her
birthday he gave a pack of tarot cards. Later on she purchased a
crystal ball to see what their future holds. Hughes consulted the Quija
board for bets on soccer. </p>
      <p>Plath typed up the manuscript of Hughes's <i>The Hawk in the
Rain</i> (1957), his first volume of verse. It included some of his
best poems, such as 'The Thought-Fox' and the title poems, 'The Hawk in
the Rain'. "I imagine this midnight moment's forest: / Something else
is alive / Beside the clock's loneliness / And this blank page where my
fingers move." <font size="2">(in 'The Thought-Fox')</font> It was
followed by <i>Pike</i> (1959) and <i>Lupercal</i> (1960), which won
a Somerset Maugham Award (1960) and the 1961 Hawthornden Prize.
Hughes's collection <i>Selected Poems</i> (1962), with Thom Gunn, is
considered a new turn in English verse. </p>
      <p>During this period Hughes also supported Plath through her
depressions and encouraged her when publishers rejected her work. "I
sometimes feel a paralysis come over me: his opinion is so important to
me", she wrote in her journal. Hughes and Plath returned to England in
1959 and in 1961 they moved to Devon. Plath suspected him of
infidelity, first falsely but then correctly when Hughes met Assia
Wevill, a German-born, cosmopolitan woman who had been married three
times. At that time she was married to the Canadian poet David Wevill. </p>
      <p>Hughes's first collection of poetry for children was <i>Meet
My Folks!</i> (1961). <i>How the Wale Became</i> (1963) was a
collection of creation stories. Both <i>How the Whale Became </i>and <i>The
Iron Man</i> (1968) were dedicated to his children. <i>What Is Truth?
A Farmyard Tale for the Young</i> (1984) won the <i>Guardian </i>Children's
Book Prize and the Signal Poetry Prize. <i>The Iron Man</i> was
originally written for his own children. This widely translated book
tells about a huge Iron Man whose origin is unknown. He steals all
tractors, threshers and digging machines from local farmers &#8211; he has an
insatiable appetite for metals. The farmers try to capture the strange,
rusty being. However, the Iron Man escapes from a trap. A young boy
befriends with him and leads him to a scrapyard, where the Iron Man has
all kinds of metal scrap, from old cars and stoves to bicycles, to eat.
A giant Space-Bat-Dragon-Angel appears from the space &#8211; its head is the
size of Italy and it threatens to eat the villages and cities of the
world. The Iron Man defeats the creature. The bat starts its journey
back to Orion, its home star, singing a song which brings peace on
earth. The book inspired the animated movie <i>Iron Giant</i> (1999)
and had a sequel, <i>The Iron Woman</i> (1993). </p>
      <p>After Sylvia Plath's suicide in London in 1963, Hughes stopped
writing poetry for nearly three years while editing and publishing her
poems. He also helped to gain public recognition for Plath's <i>Ariel</i>,
a collection of poems, which had appeared in 1965. It was not until
1971, when Hughes explained to his children that their mother had
committed suicide. According to Elaine Feinstein, whose well-balanced
biography on the author came out in 2001, he never recovered from the
loss. Hughes divided his time between London and Court Green, his Devon
house. Plath's death made Hughes a pariah in the eyes of some writers.
Many feminist critics cited her poems, in which Hughes was represented
as a "brute". Moreover, his name was chipped off her tombstone in
Yorkshire and his poetry readings were disrupted by shouts of "murder".
The writer Germaine Greer later admitted, ''Ted Hughes existed to be
punished..." </p>
      <p>At the age of 40, Hughes produced perhaps his most famous
work, <i>Crow</i> (1970), a series of story-poems. The protagonist,
"Crow", is an embodiment of vitality that challenges the supremacy of
"Death". At the end of the poem, a man and a woman are ready to whisper
"Your will is our peace" in mistaken allegiance to the serpent; Crow
kills and eats it. </p>
      <p>The memory of Plath started to haunt Wevill, who feared that
Hughes would leave her. In 1969, the tragedy continued when she killed
herself and Shura, their four-year-old daughter. Wevill gave Shura
sleeping pills and turned on the gas oven, lying down with her on a
mattress. Two decades later, in <i>Capriccion </i>(1990) Hughes
wrote: "After forty I'll end it," you said / laughing / (You were
serious) as you folded / your future / Into your empty clothes. Which /
Oxfam took." </p>
      <p>Hughes edited a number of collections of verse and prose. He
was a founding editor of <i>Modern Poetry in Translation </i>magazine
and one of the founders of the Arvon Foundation. Hughes' adaptation of
Seneca's <i>Oedipus</i> was produced in 1969 at the National Theatre.
In 1971 Hughes travelled to Iran where he wrote the verse drama <i>Orghast</i>
for the director Peter Brook. He was awarded in 1977 an OBE and in 1984
he was appointed poet Laureate, at the age of 54. Interested in the
work of <a href="amichai.htm">Yehuda Amichai</a>, Hughes made the
poetry of this prominent Israeli writer known for English readers. In
addition to his literary career, Hughes took up various causes, such as
the preservation of salmon in British rivers. He strongly spoke against
the capture of salmon by nets. As a fisherman, he had several decades
of experience on the rivers Taw and Torridge. In 1983 he contributed to
Anne Voss Bark's book, <i>West Country Fly Fishing</i>. Writing to his
friend he said, "Even twenty years ago they produced 1/3 of all salmon
in the West Country. Last year only 43 salmon were caught on the
Torridge. (It used to be a thousand to 1500.) It's become a far,
sewer." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Ted Hughes</font></i><font size="2"> by Terry Gifford, 2009, p. 23) </font>With the fishing
photographer Peter Keen he collaborated in <i>River</i> (1983). </p>
      <p>Hughes stated in <i>Poetry in the Making </i>(1970) that
there is no ideal form of poetry or writing. His work ranged from free
verse to highly structured rhyme schemes. He gradually abandoned
traditional forms and stated that the "very sound of metre calls up the
ghosts of the past and it is difficult to sing one's own tune against
the choir." Though he wrote for young adults a wide variety of finely
illustrated poems, plays and prose, he did not soften his themes of
life and death with sentimentality. Hughes often embodied the primal
forces of nature as mythical animals, such as the pike ("With a sag
belly and the grin it was born with. / And indeed they spare nobody."),
the hawk, and the crow. The element of death is a part of the cycles of
nature as in 'There Came a Day' but not without a sudden humor: "There
came a day that caught the summer / Wrung its neck / Plucked it / And
ate it." </p>
      <p>Hughes's study of Sylvia Plath's life<i>, Birthday Letters </i>(1998)
became an immediate bestseller. He received all the major literary
awards in Europe, but not the Nobel Prize. In 1998 he was appointed the
Order of Merit. Hughes died of cancer on October 28, 1998, in Devon. </p>
