<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Irish novelist, noted for his
experimental use of language in such works as <em>Ulysses</em> (1922)
and <em>Finnegans Wake</em> (1939). During his career Joyce suffered
from rejections from publishers, suppression by censors, attacks by
critics, and misunderstanding by readers. From 1902 Joyce led a nomadic
life, which perhaps reflected in his interest in the character of
Odysseus. Although he spent long times in Paris, Trieste, Rome, and
Zürich, with only occasional brief visit to Ireland, his native country
remained basic to all his writings. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But when the restraining influence
of the school was at a distance I began to hunger again for wild
sensations, for the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone
seemed to offer me. The mimic warfare of the evening became at last as
wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because I
wanted real adventures to happen to myself. But real adventures, I
reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be
sought abroad."</b> (from <i>Dubliners</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>James Joyce was born in Dublin. His father, John Stanislaus
Joyce, was an impoverished gentleman, who had failed in a distillery
business and tried all kinds of professions, including politics and tax
collecting. Joyce's mother, Mary Jane Murray, was ten years younger
than her
husband. She was an accomplished pianist, whose life was dominated
by the Roman Catholic Church and her husband. In spite of the poverty,
the family struggled to maintain solid middle-class facade. According
to Joyce, his&nbsp;father had been a "a conqueror of women" as a young
man and had contracted syphilis. It had been argued that inherited
syphilis led to Joyce's near blindnessness in his later years. </p>
      <p>From
the age of six Joyce, was educated by Jesuits at
Clongowes Wood College, at Clane, and then at Belvedere College in
Dublin (1893-97).
Later the author thanked Jesuits for teaching him to think straight,
although he rejected their religious instructions. As one of his
exercises in Latin, he translated Horace's 'O fons Bandusiae' into
English. Stephen Dedalus, his fictional alter ego, mused in <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
(1916) that "The pages of his timeworn Horace never felt cold to the
touch even when his fingers were cold: they were human pages." Once
Joyce broke his glasses and was unable to do his lessons. This episode
was
recounted also in the book. <em></em> </p>
      <p>In 1898 Joyce entered the University College, Dublin, where he found his
early inspirations from the works of <a href="ibsen.htm">Henrik Ibsen</a>,
St.Thomas Aquinas and <a href="wbyeats.htm">W.B. Yeats</a>. Joyce's
first publication was an essay on Ibsen's play <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>.
It appeared in <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in 1900. At this time
he began writing lyric poems. </p>

      <p>After graduation in 1902 the twenty-year-old Joyce went to
Paris, where he worked as a journalist, teacher and in other
occupations in difficult financial conditions. He spent in France a
year, returning when a telegram arrived saying his mother was dying.
Not long after her death, Joyce was traveling again. He left Dublin in
1904 with Nora Barnacle, a chambermaid (they married in 1931), staying
in Pola, Austria-Hungary, and in Trieste, which was the world&#8217;s seventh
busiest port. Joyce gave English
lessons and talked about setting up an agency to sell Irish tweed.
Refused a post teaching Italian literature in Dublin, he continued
to live abroad.</p>
      <p>The Trieste years were nomadic, poverty-stricken, and
productive. Joyce and Nora loved this cosmopolitan port city at the
head of the Adriatic Sea, where they lived in a number of different
addresses. During this period Joyce wrote most of <em>Dubliners</em>
(1914), all of <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, the
play, <em>Exiles </em>(1918), and large sections of <i>Ulysses</i>.
Several of Joyce's siblings joined them, and two children, Giorgio and
Lucia, were born. The children grew up speakin the Trieste dialect of
Italian. Joyce and Nora stayed together althoug Joyce fell in love with
Anny Schleimer, the daughter of an Austrian banker, and Roberto
Prezioso, the editor of the newspaper <i>Il Piccolo della Sera</i>,
tried to seduce Nora. After a short stint in Rome in 1906-07 as a bank
clerk ended in illness, Joyce returned to Trieste. </p>
      <p>In 1907 Joyce published a collection of poems, <em>Chamber
Music</em>. The
title was suggested, as the author later stated, by the sound of urine
tinkling
into a prostitute's chamber pot. The poems have with their open vowels
and repetitions such musical quality that many of them have been made
into songs. "I have left my book, / I have left my room, / For I heard
you singing / Through the gloom." Joyce himself had a fine tenor voice;
he liked opera and <i>bel canto</i>. </p>
      <p>In 1909 Joyce opened a cinema in Dublin,
but this affair failed and he was soon back in Trieste, still broke and
working as a teacher, tweed salesman, journalist and lecturer. In 1912
he was in Ireland, trying to persuade Maunsel &amp; Co to fulfill their
contract to publish <i>Dubliners</i>. The work contained a series of
short stories,
dealing with the lives of ordinary people, youth, adolescence, young
adulthood, and maturity. The last story, 'The Dead', was adapted into
screen by John Huston in 1987. </p>
      <p>It was
Joyce's last journey to his home country. However, he had became
friends with Ezra Pound, who
began to market his works. In 1916 appeared <i>Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man</i>, an autobiographical novel. It apparently began as a
quasi-biographical memoir entitled <i>Stephen Hero</i> between 1904
and 1906. Only a fragment of the original manuscript has survived. The
book follows the life of the protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, from
childhood towards maturity, his education at University College,
Dublin, and rebellion to free himself from the claims of family and
Irish nationalism. Stephen takes religion seriously, and considers
entering a seminary, but then also rejects Roman Catholicism. "&#8211; Look
here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would do and what I
would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I
will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call
itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express
myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as
I can, using my defence the only arms I allow myself to use &#8211; silence,
exile, and cunning."<font size="2"><b> </b></font>At the end Stephen
resolves to leave Ireland
for Paris to encounter "the reality of experience". He wants to
establish himself as a writer. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>There once was a lounger named
Stephen </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Whose youth was most odd and uneven </font><br>
        </b><font color="white" size="2">--</font><b><font size="2">He

        </b><font color="white" size="2">--</font><b><font size="2">Of
a horrible hell </font><br>
        <font size="2">That a Hottentot wouldn't believe in. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(Joyce's limerick on the book's protagonist) </font></blockquote>
      <p>At the outset of the First World War, Joyce moved with his
family to Zürich, where Lenin and the poet essayist Tristan Tzara had
found their refuge. <font size="2"><font size="2">
      </font></font>Joyce's WW I years with the legendary Russian
revolutionary and Tzara, who founded the dadaist movement at the
Cabaret Voltaire, provide the basis for Tom
Stoppard's play <i>Travesties</i> (1974).</p>
      <p>In Zürich Joyce started to develop the early chapters of <i>Ulysses</i>,
which was
first published in France, because of censorship troubles in the Great
Britain and the United States, where the book became legally available
1933. The theme of jealousy was based partly on a story a former friend
of Joyce told: he claimed that he had been sexually intimate with the
author's wife, Nora, even while Joyce was courting her. <i>Ulysses</i>
takes place on one day in Dublin (June 16, 1904) and reflected the
classic work of Homer (fl. 9th or 8th century BC?). </p>
      <p>The main characters are Leopold Bloom, a Jewish advertising
canvasser, his wife Molly, and Stephen Dedalus, the hero from <i>Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man.</i> They are intended to be modern
counterparts of Telemachus, Ulysses, and Penelope. Barmaids are the
famous Sirens. One of the models for Bloom was Ettore Schmitz (Italo
Svevo), a novelist and businessman who was Joyce's student at the
Berlitz school in Trieste. The story, using stream-of-consciousness
technique, parallel the major events in Odysseus' journey home.
However, Bloom's adventures are less heroic and his homecoming is less
violent. Bloom makes his trip to the underworld by attending a funeral
at Glasnevin Cemetary. "We are praying now for the repose of his soul.
Hoping you're well and not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the
fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>The
paths of Stephen and Bloom cross and recross through the day.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Joyce's technical innovations in the art of the
novel include an extensive use of interior monologue; he used a complex
network of symbolic parallels drawn from the mythology, history, and
literature. </p>
      <p>From 1917 to 1930 Joyce endured several eye operations, being
totally blind for short intervals. (According to tradition, Homer was
also blind.) In March 1923 Joyce began in Paris his second major work, <i>Finnegans
Wake</i>, suffering at the same time chronic eye troubles caused by
glaucoma. The first segment of the novel appeared in <a href="fford.htm">Ford Madox Ford</a>'s<i> transatlantic review</i> in
April 1924, as part of what Joyce called <i>Work in Progress</i>. <i>Wake</i>
occupied Joyce's time for the next sixteen years &#8211; its final version
was completed late in 1938. A copy of the novel was present at Joyce's
birthday celebration on February 1939. </p>
      <p>Joyce's daughter Lucia, born in Trieste in 1907, became <a href="cjung.htm">Carl Jung</a>'s patient in 1934. In her teens, she
studied dance, and later <i>The Paris Times</i> praised her skills as
choreocrapher, linguist, and performer. With her father she
collaborated in&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Pomes Penyeach</em></span>
(1927), for which she did some illustrations. Lucia's great love was
Samuel Beckett, who was not interested in her. In the 1930s, she
started to behave erratically. At the Burghölz psychiatric clinic in
Zürich, where Jung worked, she was diagnosed schizophrenic. Joyce was
left bitter at Jung's analysis of his daughter &#8211; Jung thought she was
too close with her father's psychic system. In revenge, Joyce played in
      <i>Finnegans Wake</i> with Jung's concepts of Animus and Anima.
Lucia died in a mental hospital in Northampton, England, in 1982.</p>
      <p>After the fall of France in WWII, Joyce returned to Zürich,
where he was taken ill. He was diagnosed of having a perforated
duodenal ulcer. Joyce died after an operation, on January 13, 1941,
still disappointed with the reception of <i>Finnegans Wake</i>,
published on 4 May, 1939, by Faber and Faber. His last words were:
"Does nobody understand?"
Joyce was buried in Zürich at Fluntern cemetery. </p>
      <p><i>Finnegans Wake</i> was the last and most revolutionary work
of the author, partly based on Freud's dream psychology, Bruno's theory
of the complementary but conflicting nature of opposites, and the
cyclic theory of history of Giambattista Vico (1668-1744). There is not
much plot or characters to speak of &#8211; the life of all human experience
is viewed as fragmentary. Some critics considered
the work masterpiece, though many readers found it incomprehensible.
"The only demand I make of my reader," Joyce once told an interviewer,
"is that he should devote his whole life to reading my works." When the
American writer Max Eastman asked Joyce why the book was written in a
very difficult style, Joyce replied: "To keep the critics busy for
three hundred years." The novel presents
the dreams and nightmares of H.C. Earwicker (Here Comes Everywhere) and
his family, the wife and mother Anna Livia Plurabelle, the twins
Shem/Jerry and Shaun/Kevin, and the daughter Issy, as they lie asleep
throughout the night. In the frame of the minimal central story Joyce
experiments with language, combines puns and
foreign words with allusions to historical, psychological and
religious cosmology. The characters turn up in hundreds of different
forms &#8211; animal, vegetable and mineral. Transformations are as flexible
as in Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>. The last word in the book is 'the',
which leads, by Joyce's ever recurrent cycles, to the opening word in
the book, the eternal 'riverrun.' </p>
      <p>Although the events are set in the Dublin suburb of
Chapelizod, the place is an analogy for everywhere else. <i>Wake's</i>
structure follows the three stages of history as laid out by Vico: the
Divine, the Heroic, and Human, followed period of flux, after which
the cycle begins all over again: the last sentence in the work
runs into the first. The title of the book is a compound of Finn
MaCool, the Irish folk-hero who is supposed to return to life
at some future date to become the savior of Ireland, and Tim
Finnegan, the hero of music-hall ballad, who sprang to life
in the middle of his own wake.</p>
