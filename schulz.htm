      <p>Writer and graphic artist, whose brief career ended tragically
during World War II, when he was gunned down by a German officer in the
ghetto of Drohobycz. Schulz is best-known for his short stories. His is
considered one of the finest Polish prose stylists of the 20th century.
The American writer John Updike has called Schulz "one of the great
transmogrifies of the world into words." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am simply calling it The Book
without any epithets or qualifications, and in this sobriety there is a
shade of helplessness, a silent capitulation before the vastness of the
transcendental, for no word, no allusion, can adequately suggest the
shiver of fear the presentiment of a thing without name that exceeds
all our capacity for wonder. </b></font><b><font size="2">"</font></b><font size="2"> (from 'The Book' in </font><i><font size="2">Sanatorium
Under the Sign of the Hourglass</font></i><font size="2">, 1937)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Bruno Schulz was born in Drohobycz (now Drogobych, Ukraine), a
small town in Galicia, into a Jewish family. The area was then part of
the Austrian Empire. His father run a clothing shop, but left it to the
care of his wife due to his poor health. Also a very important figure
in the house was the sadistic maid. Schulz studied architecture at Lvov
University and fine arts in Vienna, specializing in lithography and
drawing. After returning to his native town, he worked from 1924 to
1939 as an art teacher in the local gymnasium. One of his students has
later recalled that Schulz was considered strange; he was laughed at
behind his back. Schulz always wore a flannel jacket and a scarf around
his neck. After his friend Wladyslaw Riff died of tuberculosis in 1927,
Schulz stopped writing prose for years. The sanitary officers, who
disinfected Riff's lodgings, burned all of his manuscripts and his
letters from Schulz. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Schulz did not start his literary career until the 1930s. His
reviews appeared in literary magazine <i>Wiadomosci Literackie</i>, he
corresponded with such avant-gardists as Witold Gombrowicz (1904-1969)
and Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz (1885-1939), but mostly Schulz lived
far from the literary circles. In the mid-1930s he spent some time in
Warsaw and visited also Paris. Although Schulz's correspondence with
the Yiddish poet Deboah Vogel and other women was intense, he never
married. </p>
      <p>In 1938 Schulz was awarded the Golden Laurel of the Polish
Academy of Literature. In 1939 Germany invaded Poland from the West and
the remainder of the country was occupied by the Soviet Union. Between
1939 and 1941 Schulz lived in the Soviet-occupied territory, but when
Germany attacked the U.S.S.R., Drohobycz was occupied by the Nazis. A
Gestapo officer, Felix Landau, liked Schulz's drawings, arranged him a
pass out of the ghetto, and commissioned him to paint frescoes in his
house. Landau killed a Jewish dentist who was protected by another
Gestapo officer, Karl Günther. In the "Aryan" quarter Schulz was
spotted by him, and shot in retaliation, on the street in November 19,
1942. The manuscript of his novel, entitled <i>Messiah</i>, is said to
exist in the KGB archives relating to the Gestapo. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"On Saturday afternoons I used to
go for a walk with my mother. From the dusk of the hallway, we stepped
at once into the brightness of the day. The passers-by, bathed in
melting gold, had their eyes half closed against the glare, as if they
were drenched with honey. Upper lips were drawn back, exposing the
teeth. Everyone in this golden day wore that grimace of heat - as if
the sun had forced his worshipers to wear identical masks of gold. The
old and the young, women and children, faces with thick gold paint;
they smiled at each other's pagan faces - the barbaric smiles of
Bacchus." </b>(from 'August' in</font><i><font size="2"> The Street of
Crocodiles</font></i><font size="2">, 1934) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Schulz wrote in Polish although he knew both Yiddish and
German. As a writer Schulz made his debut with <i>Sklepy Cynamonowe</i>
(1934), a collection of short stories, which was published at the
urging of the novelist Zofia Nalkowska. Its title can be translated as
"Cinamon shops". The book was followed by <i>Sanatorium pod Klepsydra</i>
(1937, The Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass). With these two
collections Schulz became one of the most original figures of polish
avant-garde, joining the front rank of Stanislaw Witkiewicz and Witold
Gombrowicz. In 1938 he was awarded the Golden Laurel of the Polish
Academy of Literature. Schulz's prose reflected the influence of Franz
Kafka, but in spite of their threatening atmosphere, they had
surrealistic humor and realistic details, which tied them to everyday
family life. Kafka was a very close author to Schulz, but he also drew
from Hasidic literature and folktales. According to some sources he did
not translate Kafka's novel <i>The Trial</i> into Polish, but lent his
name to a work made by his fiancee, Jósefina Szelinska. </p>
      <p>After the war Schulz was "rediscovered" and a comprehensive
collection of his stories, <i>Proza</i>, was published in 1964. It
included also letters and literary reviews. Philip Roth included the
published collections of fiction in his Writers from Other Europe
Series. Schulz's erotically suggestive paintings and drawings have been
compared to those of Utrillo, de Chirico, Henri Rousseau, and Chagall.
A selection of his drawings was published in <i>Druga jesien</i>
(1973).</p>
      <p>Schulz's drawing and paintings were discovered in 2001 and
shipped to Israel, to the Holocaust memorial. Schulz has also featured
in novels by Philip Roth (<i>The Prague Orgy</i>, in which Schulz is
never mentioned by name), Cynthia Ozick (placed in the center of <i>The
Messiah of Stockholm</i>, dedicated to Roth), and David Grossman (<i>See
Under: Love</i>, in which Schulz appears both as a fictional character
and as himself).</p>
      <p>From 1934, Schulz had worked on a novel entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Messiah</span>. In 1990, the Swedish
ambassador to Poland heard from a Soviet civil servant that a packet of
papers had been found, mis-shelved, in the KGB archives relating to the
Gestapo. The top sheet announced the novel Messiah.<font size="-1">
(Stuart Kelly, in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Book of Lost
Books</span>, pp. 359-361)</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>In his short stories Schulz created a mythical childhood world
which combined autobiographical elements with fantastic elements and
occasionally masochist bursts. His central character is the Father,
Jakub, whom the narrators describes through the eyes of Józef, his son.
Other characters are Adela, the servant girl, and the narrator's
mother. Schulz's stories leave much unsaid, he doesn't rely on
conventional plot development, and often there is not much events. Life
in Schulz's world follows its own logic and undergoes transmutations,
and his characters live parallel realities. In Dr. Gothard's sanatorium
the clock is put back to postpone the Father's death. At great cost he
imports rare birds' eggs to hatch in his attic, and soon the house if
full or exotic birds. He is a great believer in metamorphosis and his
obsessive fear of cockroaches causes him to resemble one. When a son is
changed into a giant cockroach in one of <a href="kafka.htm">Kafka</a>'s
most famous stories, 'The Metamorphosis', Schulz turns the Father into
a crab-like being, who climbs curtains, eats crumbs of bread and little
pieces of meat from the floor, and sleeps under a table. Eventually
Józef's mother cooks the creature for the dinner, but nobody wants
touch the gray crab. The Father spends some days in his bowl and then
disappears, l
eaving behind one leg in the tomato sauce and jelly. </p>
