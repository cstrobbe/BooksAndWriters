      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->German poet, novelist,
playwright,
sculptor,
and printmaker, who, with his extraordinary first novel<em> Die
Blechtrommel</em> (1959, The Tin Drum) became
the literary spokesman for the German generation that grew up in Nazi
era. Grass received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999. The author
has described himself as "Spätaufklärer", a belated apostle of
enlightenment in an era that has grown tired of reason. He once said,
that writers, by giving us ''mouth-to-ear artificial respiration,''
help keep humanity alive. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You can
begin a story in the middle and create confusion by striking out
boldly, backward and forward. You can be modern, put aside all mention
of time and distance and, when the whole thing is done, proclaim, or
let someone else proclaim, that you have finally, at the last moment,
solved the space-time problem. Or you can declare at the very start
that it's impossible to write a novel nowadays, but then, behind your
own back so to speak, give birth to a whopper, a novel to end all
novels."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Tin Drum</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Günter Grass was born in the (former) Free City of Danzig (now
Gdánsk, Poland), the scene of his several novels. His father owned a
grocery and his mother was of Kashubian origin &#8211; Slavic people distinct
from the Poles both as to language and culture. Grass was educated at
Danzig Volksschule and Gymnasium. In the 1930s he joined the Hitler
Youth, was drafted into the army at the age of 16, and wounded in a
battle in 1945. In an interview from 2006, Grass admitted that he had
served in the notorious Waffen SS. "It had to come out finally," Grass
said. "It will stain me forever." Grass was imprisoned in Marienbad,
Czechoslovakia. When he managed to get assigned to work in the United
States Army canteen, he was shocked by the amount of food that&nbsp;the
soldiers&nbsp;threw away. Freed in 1946, Grass supported himself by
working on farms, in a potash mine, and as a stonemason's apprentice. </p>
      <p>In 1948 Grass enrolled as a student of painting and sculpture
in the Düsseldorf Academy of Art. He studied in West Berlin at State
Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin (1953-55)&nbsp;and made journeys to
Italy, France, and Spain. In 1954 he married Anna Margareta Schwartz &#8211;
they were divorced in 1978. In 1979 Grass married Ute Grunert. </p>
      <p>Both in Düsseldorf and Berlin Grass had written poetry, some
of which he read before Group 47, an influential circle of writers.
From 1956 to 1960 he worked as a sculptor and writer in Paris. In 1960
he settled in West-Berlin. While staying in Paris in 1956, Grass
started his hugely successful first novel, <i>The Tin Drum</i>. His
other works from the late 1950s were mostly plays, which, like his
verse, achieved only modest public acclaim. <i>The Tin Drum</i> caused
a furor in Germany because of its depiction of the Nazis. The central
character is Oscar Matzerath, who has refused to grow as a protest to
the cruelties of German history. He communicates only through his toy
drum. </p>
      <p><i>Die Blechtrommel </i>(The Tin Drum) was filmed in 1979 by
Volker Schlöndorff,&nbsp;starring David Bennent (Oskar), Mario Adorf
(Alfred Matzerath), Angela Winkler (Agnes Matzerath), Daniel
Olbrychski, Katherina Thalbach, Mariella Oliveri. The story is set in
Poland and starts from the early 1900s. A peasant girl gives birth to
Agnes. After World War I she marries Alfred, a grocer in Danzig. She
has an affair with her cousin Jan, who may be the father of Oskar. At
the age of three Oskar resolves not to grow. As a mark of his decision
he, becomes attached to his toy tin drum. Fascists take over Danzig.
Agnes dies after being forced to eat eels by Alfred, who remarries.
Oskar leads Jan to the besieged Polish post office, where he is
captured and executed by the Germans. Oskar then joins a circus and
returns at the end of the war to Danzig. Alfred is shot as a
collaborator and Oskar starts growing again. 12-year-old David Bennent
in the role of Oskar produced a startling performance. Volker
Schlöndorff later gave up on the idea of a sequel which would follow
the rest of the novel. </p>
      <p>Danzig has been for Grass what Dublin was for Joyce. <i>The
Tin Drum</i> was the first part of Grass' 'Danzig trilogy', which
continued in the novella<em> Katz und Maus</em> (1961, Cat and Mouse),
depicting the experiences on lower-middle-class youth in Danzig from
1939 to 1944. <em>Hundejahre</em> (1963, Dog Years) Grass later
regarded as a false start on the third part. The novel focused on the
Nazi crimes and the postwar acceptability of former Nazis. From Dangiz
Grass turned his attention to Berlin. In the play <em>Die Plebejer
proben den Aufstand</em>&nbsp;(1966, The Plebeians Rehearse the
Uprising) Bertolt Brecht appears as the Boss, who declines to leave his
theatrical preoccupation to support the East Berlin workers' reformist
uprising. The novel <em>Örtlich betäubt</em> (1969, Local Anaesthetic)
and the drama <em>Davor</em>, based on the novel, had Berlin as the
scene of events. </p>
      <p>After establishing his fame with the trilogy, Grass became
active in politics, though he did not abandon his anti-ideological
scepticism. He worked as a ghost-writer for the leader of the Social
Democrats, Willy Brandt (1913-1992), who was elected chancellor from
1969-74. (Collection of speeches and essays: <em>Der Bürger und seine
Stimme,</em> 1974 &#8211; The Citizen and his Voice). </p>
      <p>In the 1970s and 1980s Grass expanded his subjects from recent
German history and contemporary politics into other issues, such as
feminism, the art of cooking, and ecology. He traveled to India for the
first time in 1975 and in the late 1980s he spent some months in
Calcutta. Grass' diary, <em>Zunge zeigen</em> (1988), collected his
impressions from the visit.&nbsp;<em>Aus dem Tagebuch einer Schnecke</em>
(1972, From the Diary of a Snail) Grass invented a 'diary' of his
travels as a campaigner for the Social Democrats and Willy Brandt in
the 1969 election. Interwoven with the account and views of the
narrator and the author, is a story about Hermann Ott, held up as an
example of "the good German". He is a collector snails, well known for
their slow movement, which in the book becomes a symbol of Social
Democratic policy: "Only those who know and respect stasis in progress,
who have once and more than once given up, who have sat on an empty
snail shell and experienced the dark side of utopia, can evaluate
progress." <font size="2">(<i>From The Diary of a Snail</i>,
1972) </font>Otto takes a refuge from the Nazis with a Kashubian, who
wants to become a German. W.G. Sebald accused Grass of paying lip
service to the crimes of National Socialism. </p>
      <p><em>Der Butt</em>&nbsp;(1977, The Flounder) plays with
mythology and time, spanning from prehistoric matriarchy to the Gdansk
shipyards of the 1970s. Grass portrays the development of civilization
as a struggle between men's destructive dreams of grandeur and female
accomplishment. He also explores the historical role of cooks, sexual
roles, feminism &#8211; there is a talking flounder, from the Grimms' fairy
tale 'The Fisherman and His Wife'. Animals appear often in the titles
of Grass's books: there is a cat, mouse, dog, snail, rat, toad, and
crab, they don't seem to have anything in common, except that they are
very ordinary. </p>
      <p>Among Grass' works from the 1980s and 1990s are <em>Die Rättin</em>
(1986, The Rat), in which the narrator receives as a present a female
rat, who demonstrates in several stories that the rats will inherit the
earth.<em> Unkenrufe</em> (1992, The Call of the Toad) is a story about
two widows, a German art historian, and a Polish restorer. They go into
business together returning the remains of Germans exiled after the war
to Danzig. <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Ein weites Feld</em> </span></span>(1995)
is set in the years of German reunification 1989-91. It was the first
major literary work to deal with this historical event after the Berlin
Wall was removed. The protagonist, Theo Wuttke, has devoted his life to
the study of the 19th-century writer Theodor Fontane, and comments the
daily events by searching parallels to them from the history. The
book's title comes from Fontane's novel, <i>Effi Briest</i>, which was
published in 1895, but the author's most timely work is <i>Jenny
Treibel</i> (1892), set in Berlin after the national unification of
1871. The narrative shifts back and forth in time as Wuttke roams
through Berlin with his shadow, Ludwig Hoftaller, a mid-level spy, a
faithful servant of the Gestapo and then the Stasi. Grass himself
opposed the unification of the two German states, and compared it to
Nazi Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938. One of Grass's critics,
Marcel Reich-Ranicki, literally teared the book apart in <i>Der
Spiegel</i>.</p>
      <p>As an essayist Grass has been prolific, dealing with several
topics often embedded in historical context. However, for an outsider
his mockeries of what he sees to be the faults of Germany and German
people, is many times hard to understand.&nbsp;Noteworthy, Grass
opposed in 1989-91 German's hasty reunification. In 1992 he dedicated a
public address about the decline of political culture in the United
Germany to the Turkish victims of Mölln. In his later essays Grass has
criticized contemporary culture and politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Grass'&nbsp;poem 'What Must Be Said,' published in
2012,&nbsp;asked&nbsp;does "the nuclear power of Israel / threat the
world peace?" Soon afterwards, he was declared personan non grata in
Israel. </p>
      <p>In&nbsp;<em>Über meinen Lehrer Döblin und andere Vorträge</em>
(1968) Grass declared his debt to <a href="adoblin.htm">Alfred Döblin</a>,
a writer-politician, although in the artistic sense literary influences
are not so clear. Grass' comic fantasy is quite distinctive for German
literature; he has created narrators who are acutely conscious of their
art of storytelling, and in his poems he has approached surrealism.
Volker Neuhaus wrote in <i>Günter Grass </i>(1979), that the lyric
forms in Grass a universal constant. "Not only is the lyric &#8211; together
with sculpture and graphics &#8211; Grass's earliest form of artistic
expression, but right up to the many poems in <i>The Flounder</i> he
has never given it up."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Grass's
novelistic style is often described as baroque. In spite of the
fantastic elements, recent criticism inclines to regard such novels as <i>The
Tin Drum </i>as primarily historical or even realistic.</p>
      <p>From 1986 to 1987 Grass
lived in India, which he has depicted in <em>Zunge zeigen</em>&nbsp;(1988,
Show Your Tongue). From 1976 he has been coeditor of <i>L</i> and from
1980 Verlag L '80 publishers. Between the years 1983 and 1986 he was
President of Berlin Academy of Arts.&nbsp;Besides the Nobel
Prize,&nbsp;Grass' several awards&nbsp;include Gruppe 47 Prize (1958),
Critics' Prize (1960, Germany), Foreign Book Prize (1962, France),
Bühner Prize (1965), Fontane Prize (1968), Heuss Prize (1969), Mondello
Prize (1977, Palermo), Carl von Ossiersky Medal (1977),
Viareggio-Versilia Prize (1978), Majakowski Medal (1977), Feltrinelli
Prize (1982), Leonhard Frank Ring (1988). In his Nobel lecture Grass
stated: "Once more I open The Rat to the fifth chapter, in which the
laboratory rat, representing millions of other laboratory animals in
the cause of research, wins the Nobel Prize, and I am reminded how few
prizes have been awarded to projects that would rid the world of the
scourge of mankind: hunger."<font size="2"> </font>Grass has honorary
degrees from three colleges and universities.</p>
      <p>Grass's later works include <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Mein
Jahrhundert</em> </span></span>(1999), a running commentary on the the
20th century, and <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Im Krebsgang</em>
      </span></span>
(2002, Crabwalk), about the taboo of German guilt. During the war,
Grass witnessed instances of German wartime suffering, but it was not
until his adulthood that he could&nbsp;form a&nbsp;clear
picture&nbsp;of&nbsp;injustices&nbsp;that had unfolded right
before&nbsp;his very eyes. <i>Crabwalk </i>dealt with the sinking of
the German liner, "Wilhelm Gustloff", in January 1945, by a Soviet
submarine. It has been estimated that 8.000-9.000 passangers, mostly
refugees and wounded soldiers, drowned. The book became a best seller
and was soon translated into several languages. "For Grass to tell the
story at the opening of the new century means something. It may even
signal that it is acceptable, appropriate for all the stories of what
happened in those terrible years to enter the public arena." (<font size="2">J.M. Coetzee in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Review
of Books</font></i><font size="2">, June 12, 2003) </font></p>
      <p>In <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Beim
Häuten der Zwiebel</em> </span></span>(2006), an account of the
author's first 32 years, Grass revealed that he had served in the SS
for a few months. The&nbsp;confession stirred an international
controversy and questions were raised about his artistic credibility.
However, Grass had been relatively open about his SS membership until
the mid-1960s. He reflected ironically his failure to enter a literary
competition in the Nazi children's newspaper<em> Hilf mit!</em> because
"the premature debut of my literary career would have been
Nazi-tarnished".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
