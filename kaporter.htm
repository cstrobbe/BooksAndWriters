<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American essayist, short story writer, and 
journalist, whose only novel was <em>Ship of Fools </em>(1962),
an allegorical story set on a passenger ship. Before&nbsp;the
work&nbsp;was finished, Porter spent twenty years with it. The name of
the title came from an old German
satire <i>Das Narrenschiff</i> (1494), by Sebastian Brant. Porter is also remembered as one of America's best short-story writers. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I don't want any promises, I won't have
false hopes, I won't be romantic about myself. I can't live in their
world any longer, she told herself, listening to the voices back of
her. Let them tell their stories to each other. Let them go on
explaining how things happened. I don't care. At least I can know the
truth about what happens to me, she assured herself silently, making a
promise to herself, in her hopefulness, her ignorance." </b>(from 'Old Mortality,' in </font><i><font size="2">Pale Horse, Pale Rider</font></i><font size="2">, 1939) </font></blockquote>
<p>Porter started as a communist sympathizer but she became a friend of
a Nazi leader; and she was a southerner who led a cosmopolitan life.
Porter's literary production can be divided in three stages: her early
writings done in Mexico, the rediscovery of her southern identity, and
the last period of disillusionment. In her social life Porter's circle
of acquaintances included such figures as President Obregon of Mexico,
Herman Göring in Berlin, writers Eudora Welty and Allen Tate, and
members of the Johnson White House. </p>
<p>Katherine Anne Porter was born Callie Russell Porter in Indian
Creek, Texas, but she grew up in Hays County, Texas. Part of her
childhood was spent also in Louisiana. She was the fourth child of
Harrison Boone Porter and Mary Alice Jones Porter, who died when
Katherine&nbsp;Anne was two. Later she blamed her father for the death
of her mother, who had given birth to five children in eight years.
Porter's father always claimed that he was a descendent of Daniel
Boone, the legendary pioneer and explorer. </p>
<p>Porter's paternal grandmother, Catharine Ann Skaggs Porter, who
raised Katherine's father, was a stern disciplinarian. However,
Catharine's reminiscences of the Civil War and tales of her family's
past were Porter's first introduction to the art of storytelling. She
died when Porter was eleven, but her strong character provided a model
for grandmothers in her stories. </p>
<p>Porter was educated in convent schools though her formal education
was rather irregular. In 1904-05 she attended the Thomas School in San
Antonio. At the age of sixteen she ran away from a New Orleans convent
and married the first of her four husbands, John Koontz, whose parents
were not pleased by their union. This marriage lasted nine years;
religion was the first of many differences. Moreover, Koontz was not
interested in literature or other arts. After divorce Porter contracted
tuberculosis and during her recovery she decided to became a
writer.&nbsp;Her study<em>&nbsp;Outline of Mexican Popular Arts and Crafts</em> came out in 1922.</p><p>While
in Mexico, where&nbsp;Porter worked as a journalist and
teacher,&nbsp;she became involved in revolutionary politics, but
following the assassination of Pancho Villa, she ended her flirtation
with propaganda. Mexico, Porter once said, gave her back her Texas
past. Her feelings toward the country, however, were ambivalent. In
'Xochimilco' Porter saw Mexico as an earthly Eden where hopes for a
better society could be realized. In 'The Fiesta of Guadalupe' it was a
place of hopeless oppression for the native peoples. </p><p>In
1926 Porter had a brief romance with Ernest Stock, an English interior
decorator and painter, who left her with gonorrhea. Porter's
doctor&nbsp;recommended she have&nbsp;her ovaries removed.&nbsp;The
operation was done in&nbsp;the fall of the same
year.&nbsp;Porter's&nbsp;second husband was Eugene Dove Pressly, who
worked in the Foreign Service. He became the model for the character of
David Scott in <em>Ship of Fools.</em> They divorced in 1938 after which she married Albert Erskine, the twenty-six years old business manager for the <i>Southern Review</i>. The marriage lasted four years. 
</p>
<p>Porter&nbsp;travelled in the late 1920s to Europe, settling in Paris
in the early 1930s. During this period she became friends with the
English modernist writer Ford Madox Ford, who showed her famous Paris
attractions. Porter also contributed to leftist journals, such as <i>The New Republic</i> and <i>The Nation.</i> Her first published story was 'María Concepción,' which appeared in <i>Century </i>magazine in December 1922. Most of her early stories,&nbsp;published in such magazines as <i>New Masses</i>, <i>transition</i> and <i>Second American Caravan</i>, dealt with her experiences in Mexico.</p><p>Porter's first collection of short stories was<em> Flowering Judas</em>.
The limited edition of 600 copies appeared in 1930. However, this work
established her reputation as a highly original writer and earned her a
Guggenheim grant. The collection was enlarged in 1935. According to an
anecdote, she always wrote the last line first, claiming that if she
didn't know how a story ended, she wouldn't know how to begin it. In
the title story,&nbsp;originally printed in <i>Hound and Horn</i> in
the spring of 1930, the protagonist is a rootless woman, Laura, an
American expatriate in Mexico, who refuses to commit herself to love or
ideologies. </p>
<p><em>Pale Horse, Pale Rider </em>(1939) received also widespread
critical acclaim. It consisted of three short novels: 'Old Mortality,'
'Noon Wine,' a study of evil, set on a Texas farm circa 1900, and the
titlepiece, which tells of a short-lived love affair between a soldier
and a young Southern newspaperwoman during the influenza epidemic of
World War I. The central character in the stories is Miranda, whose
background is roughly parallel to Porter's <font face="Symbol">- </font>she runs away from a convent, and in the last story she is working as a reporter on a western newspaper. </p><p><em>The Learning Tower</em>
(1944)&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;six related stories dealing with Miranda
and the background of her family. 'The Old Order' gives the most
complete picture of Miranda's family <font face="Symbol">- </font>the
grandmother was the great-granddaughter of "Kentucky's most famous
pioneer" (Daniel Boone). The unnamed narrator is Miranda. </p>
<p>In the 1950s Porter published two volumes of essays, <em>The Days Before</em> (1952) and <em>A Defense Circle</em> (1954). Her <em>Collected Stories</em> (1965) was awarded in 1966 both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. <i>Ship of Fools</i>,
which came out when Porter was 72,&nbsp;made her rich and famous. The
novel was set in 1931 aboard a German passenger ship, a kind of a
floating purgatory, returning to Germany from Mexico. "The ship was
none of those specialized carriers of rare goods, much less an elegant
pleasure craft coming down from New York, all fresh paint and interior
decoration, bringing crowds of prosperous dressed-up tourists with
money in their pockets. No, the <i>Vera</i> was a mixed freighter and
passenger ship, very steady and broad-bottomed in her style, walloping
from one remote port to another, year in year out, honest, reliable and
homely as a German housewife." </p>
<p>The mixed bag of passengers, Germans, Americans, Spaniards, Gypsies,
and Mexicans represent a microcosmos of peoples, whose life are
characterized by jealousy, cruelty, hatred, love, and duplicity. In the
first part the reader becomes acquainted with the various characters.
The second part contains the torment of the passengers in steerage,
their attempts to love and their struggle for detachment. In part three
a bacchanalian fiesta brings out all the hidden fears and guilt. Porter
explores the origin of human evil through the allegorical use of
characters, who represent various national and moral types. Captain
Thiele is the embodiment of Teutonic authority, one passenger is a
Basque, a Christ figure, who plunges into the sea to save an aged
bulldog but drowns himself.&nbsp;The Oscar winning film version of the
novel&nbsp;from 1966 was directed by Stanley Kramer, starring Vivien
Leigh. </p>
<p>In the 1970s Porter published <em>The Collected Essays and Occasional Writings</em> (1970) and&nbsp;<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>The Never-Ending Wrong</em></span></span>
(1977), an account of the infamous Sacco-Vanzetti trial and execution.
Porter died in Silver Spring, Maryland on September 18, 1980. </p>
