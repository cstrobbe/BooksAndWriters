      <p>Novelist, dramatist, and poet, whose merciless analysis of the
mentality of his fellow countrymen earned him the reputation of the
enfant terrible of Austrian literature. Central themes in Bernhard's
work are death, suffering, and the hopelessness of the world in which
we live.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Art altogether is nothing but a
survival
skill, we should never lose sight of this fact, it is, time and again,
just an attempt&#8211;an attempt that seems touching even to our intellect&#8211;to cope with this world and its revolting aspects, which, as we know,
is invariably possible by resorting to lies and falsehoods, to
hypocrisy and self-deception, Roger said."</b> (from <i>Old Masters</i>,
1985) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Nicolaas Thomas Bernhard was born in Heerlen, near Maastrich,
Holland, the illegitimate son of Austrian parents. His father, Alois
Zuckerstätter, who came from Henndorf, Austria, was a carpenter. He
never wanted to take care of his son and refused to acknowledge his
paternity. Alois committed suicide in 1940 in Berlin, but Bernhard
himself has claimed that he died in 1943. Bernhard's mother, Herta
Bernhard, was the daughter of the author Johannes Freumbichler. Herta
married Emil Fabjan in 1936 and next year Bernhard joined them in
Trausntein. Herta died of cancer of the uterus in 1950. </p>
      <p>His earliest childhood Bernhard spent in the care of his
maternal
grandparents in Vienna and Seekirchen (Wallersee). His grandfather,
Johannes Freumbichler, who devoted himself entirely to his writing,
provided for Bernhard the model for his eccentrics in his books. He
died in 1949; the year was a turning point in Bernhard's life. </p>
      <p>In 1941 Bernhard was sent to an institution for diffucult
children.
After returning in 1942 to Traunstein he continued his school there. In
1943 he was confirned in a Catholic church. </p>
      <p>In 1947 Bernhard dropped out of the Johanneum Gymnasium in
Salzburg, and apprenticed himself to a grocer. In the dank cellar shop
Bernhard contracted a serious lung ailment. At one point he was so ill
that he was given last rites in the death ward of the local hospital.
Bernhard spent two years in convalescence. At the tuberculosis
sanatorium Gratenhof he began to write, first as a reaction to his
surroundings, but then he came to the conclusion that he existed only
through his writing. "I live in the country only because the doctors
have told me that I must live <i>in the country </i> if I want to
survive&#8212;for no other reason." <font size="2">(<i>Wittgenstein's Nephew</i>,
1982) </font>
His first published piece was 'At the Grave of a Poet'. After recovery,
he studied music and theatre arts at the Mozarteum Academy in Salzburg.
Bernhard received his diploma in directing in 1957. As a student he was
not the star of his class. On stage he frequently forgot his lines. </p>
      <p>While still studying, Bernhard began to work as a courtroom
reporter for the <i>Socialist Demokratisches Volksblatt</i>; he got
the job through family connections, but when his employers forced him
to join the socialist party, he left the paper. Bernhard also
contributed to the newspaper <i>Die Furche</i>.
In the mid-1950s, Bernhard published short prose pieces and continued
with three volumes of poetry in 1957-58. These works went almost
unnoticed. After leaving the Mozarteum, he made acquaintance with the
composer Gerhard Lampersberg and his wife Maja and wrote an
unsuccessful libretto for Lambersberg's opera. His first play was
performed in Tonhof, meeting place of the literary avant-garde of the
day. Bernhard lived there between 1957 and 1960. His friendship with
the Lambersbergs ended in bitter acrimony. Bernhard's prose work <i>Holzfällen:
Eine Erregung</i> (1984) re-opened the wounds and the Lampersbergs sued
him for defamation. </p>
      <p><i>Frost</i> (1963), Bernhard's first novel, was a long
monologue of
a medical student, who observes the fate of a doomed, misanthrophic
painter. "Everything here is barbaric kitsch. Yes, the state itself is
feebleminded and its people are pathetic," he says. The work was highly
prised by Carl Zuckmayer and became an immediate sensation. In the
mid-1960s, after nomadic years, Bernhard bought a fortress-like
farmhouse in Obernathal, a small village in Upper Austria, his
sanctuary for the following decades. He spent also much time in the
fashionable cafés of Vienna, but in <i>Old Masters</i> (1985) Bernhard
did not hide his hatred of the Viennese: "Everything suggest that they
are a lot dirtier inside than out." </p>
      <p>Bernhard received several literary awards, including
Österreichische
Staatspreis für Literatur (1967), the Anton-Wildgans-Preis der
Österreichischen Indistrie (1967), the Georg-Büchner-Preis (1970), the
Franz-Theodor-Csokor-Preis (1972). "I always was a free person, I
receive no stipend and I write my books in a completely natural way,
according to my lifestyle, which is guaranteed different from all those
people's," Bernhard said in an interview, ignoring the fact that his
publisher had helped him to buy his farm and stood by him through the
many lawsuits initiated against him. Almost all of Bernhard's complete
works were published by Suhrkamp Verlag. Nevertheless, Bernhard was not
faithful to Suhrkamp but gave the fourth part of his autobiography to
the Austrian publisher Residenz. Siegfried Unseld, the head of&nbsp;  Suhrkamp, tolerated Bernhard's quirks, until the author gave yet another manuscript to Residenz in 1988.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>Bernhard never married. His <i>Lebensmensch</i>,
companion for life, was Hedwig Stavianicek, "Auntie", 
the widow of a high-ranking Viennese ministry official. She was more than
thirty-seven years his senior. "Without her, I would not be alive at
all," Bernhard once confessed, "or at any rate I would certainly not
the person I am today, so mad and so unhappy, yet at the same time
happy." Bernhard regularly stayed in Stavianicek's apartment in Vienna.
His female friends also included Ingrid Bülau, a pianist
whom he had met at the Mozarteum. The relationship lasted over thirty
years. Stavianicek died in 1984. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Thomas Bernhard died on February 12, 1989. His half brother,
Dr. Peter
Fabjan, was with him all the time during the day of his death.
Bernhard's will caused much controversy&#8212;as a final act of opposition,
Bernhard banned all further publications of his books and prohibited
the performances of his plays in Austria. </p>
      <p>Bernhard's novels are populated with physically and mentally
defective characters, stupid peasants, isolated artists, criminals,
hypocrites and philistines. Disillusioned cold perspective, shaped by
his childhood experiences and harsh years during WWII, marks his
attitude toward the whole society, his disdain of the masses, for their
taste and general brutality. In the novel <i>Ja</i> (1978, Yes) the
protagonist says yes to suicide. Though his social reflections, he was
not a social critic&#8212;Bernard simply hated the world and its occupants.
His characters are portrayed with bleak humor, the achitect of <span style="font-style: italic;">Correction</span> (modelled on
Wittgenstein), the writer of <span style="font-style: italic;">Concrete</span>
(1982), and the misanthropic loner in <span style="font-style: italic;">Extinction</span>
(1986). <br>
      </p>
      <p>In his home county Bernhard was labelled as the
"Nestbeschmutzer" (someone who fouls his own nest). He once called his
native land "a common hell in which the
intellect is incessantly defamed and art and science are destroyed."
Although Bernhard insisted on nonideology and subjectivism, at the same
time he did not hesitate to attack the Nazi past of his country and
other sore spots. In his last play, <i>Heldenplatz</i> (1988) Bernhard
tore apart the national myths around Hitler's annexation of Austria.
The play created outrage before it even opened at Vienna's Burgtheater.
Kurt Waldheim, whose presidency was surrounded by controversy due to
his alleged Nazi activities during WW II, declared that the play was a
crude insult to the Austrian people. After the opening night, protected
by 200 policemen, most reviewers agreed that it was not Bernhard's best
play. </p>
      <p>Bernhard's style avoids all comprimisess, his sentences are
serpentive and complex; the flow of the text sometimes approachers the
formal structutes of music. Referring to Bernhard's book-lenght
monologues <a href="/jelinek.htm">Elfriede Jelinek</a> called him "a
poet of speaking" rather than writing. "German words hang like lead
weights on the German language... and constantly drag the mind down to
a level that can only be harmful to it," says Franz-Josef Murau, the
narrator of <i>Extinction</i> (1986). As in Dostoevsky's <i>Notes
from Underground</i>
the narrator, Rudolf, is a hermit and a hypocondriac. Rudolf's
monologue reveals his psychosis, and his hatred of the Austrian
society. <i>Wittgenstein's Nephew</i> (1983), Bernhard's quasi memoir
about Paul Wittgenstein, the grandnephew of the famous philosopher,
consist of one long paragraph. With Ludwig Wittgenstein, who died in
1951, Bernhard shared similar lifelong obsession with the relationship
between language and inner experience. </p>
      <p>Bernhard's plays show the influence of the theatre of the
absurd,
especially Ionesco and Beckett. The German director Claus Peymann
staged the premiere performances of most of his pieces. From the 1970s
he started to gain fame
as one of the most successful modern playwrights with such works as <i>A
Party for Boris</i> (1969), a grotesque drama written for leggless
cripples in wheelchairs, <i>The Ignoramus and the Madman</i> (1972), <i>The
Hunting Party</i> (1974), <i>The Power of Habit </i>(1974), set in a
circus, <i>The President</i> (1975), about power and corruption, and <i>Minetti</i>
(1976), written for the German actor Bernhard Minetti. In 1975 Bernhard
started from <i>Die Ursache</i> his autobiographical series, which
contined in <i>Der Keller</i> (1976), <i>Der Atem. Eine Entscheidung</i>
(1978), <i>Die Kälte</i> (1981), <i>Ein Kind</i> (1982)&#8212;together
translated as <i>Gathering Evidence</i>. "What I am describing here is
the truth and yet it is not the truth, because it cannot the truth,"
Bernhard wrote in <i>Der Keller</i>.
"In all our reading we have never read a sentence of truth, no matter
how many books we have read about actual events." The works covered the
first nineteen years of his life, exceptionally ending in his early
childhood. Bernhard parallelled breathing to writing in <i>Der Atem</i>,
they are the one and same. </p>
