<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Swedish novelist, playwright, and
journalist, who has gained international fame with his
"documentary-style" fiction. Several of Enquist's novels depict his
native Västerbotten, where the Laestadian, pietistic religious movement
deeply influenced everyday life. Enquist has also written with
expertness about sports&nbsp;&#8211; in his prime he was in Sweden among the
five best in the high jump. Enquist's record was 1,97 meters. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"But what in truth was a human
being, who could be dissected or dismembered and hung up on the post
and wheel, and yet in some way continued to live on? What was it that
was sacred? "The sacred is what the one who is sacred does," he had
thought: the human being as the sum of his existential choices and
actions. But in the end it was something else altogether, something
more important, that remained of Struensee's era. Not biology, not just
actions, but a dream of humanity's possibilities, that which was the
most sacred of all and the most difficult to capture, that which
existed as the simple, persistent note of a flute from Struensee's era
and which refused to be cut off."</strong> (from <em>Livläkarens besök</em>, 1999) </font></blockquote>
<p>Per Olov Enquist was born and raised in Hjoggböle in northern
Sweden, the son of Elof Enquist, a laborer, and Maria Lindgren Enquist,
a schoolteacher. While he was still an infant, his father
died.&nbsp;Enquist studied at the University of Uppsala from 1955 to
1964, where he completed an M.A. and a thesis on the crime noves of
Thorsten Johnsson. His career as a writer started among the modernists
of the 1960s generation, whose works reflected the influence of the
French <a href="grillet.htm"><i>nouveau roman</i></a> (Alain Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon, Nathalie Sarraute, Michel Butor, Marguerite Duras). </p><p>Enquist's first novel&nbsp;<em>Kristallögat</em>&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1961. "At a time when young writers were looking for new
forms of literary expression, Enquist settled for an investigative
style, an attempt to reconstruct events reported to have happened but
where the truth is often too inaccessible, the facts too complex to
yield anything but ambiguous answers. It was a style that was to remain
Enquist's literary trademark, characterising both his novels and his
plays." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Contemporary World Authors</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Tracy Chevalier , 1993) </font>In
the United States Norman Mailer and Truman Capote developed a form of
journalism, that combined actual events with the richness of a novel. </p>
<p>With his third novel, <em>Magnetisörens femte vinter</em> (1964),
Enquist received widespread public and critical acclaim. The novel was
set in a small German town and portrays a man, Friedrich Meisner, who
resembles the famous experimenter in magnetism, F.A. Mesmer
(1734-1815). The miracle worker is caught in a conflict between faith
and disbelief, irrational and rational forces. Meisner helps the
daughter of the townsman Claus Selinger to see again. Selinger falls
under the spell of the doctor, but later reveals his dishonesty. But
nobody can deny that his daughter is no longer blind. "I must show
great circumspection in teaching her to see. She can see now; but no
one knows what she sees." One of the author's sources was P.G.
Cederschjöld's report of 1821&nbsp;&#8211; he was a doctor and used Mesmer's
ideas in medical care. Enquist's further experiment with the
documentary approach is seen in <em>Hess</em>(1966), which explored
the solo flight of Rudolf Hess to England to end World War II. A
researcher writes a treatise of the Nazi leader and other people who
have the same name. Gradually he becomes fascinated with Hess, breaking
the principle of scientific objectivity. With <em>Legionärerna</em>
(1968) Enquist won the prestigious Nordic Council literary prize. It
was a story of Sweden's deportation of a number of Baltic soldiers who
fled from the German army at the end of WW II. Both works have been
translated into some ten languages. </p>
<p><i>Legionärerna</i> was based on documents, interviews, private
letters and many other sources. Enquist travelled in England, Denmark
and the Soviet Union where he met the former legionaries and heard
their stories. He even experimented with a hunger strike to feel what
it meant for the Baltic soldiers. Surprisingly the book includes an
open letter to Mao Zedong in which the author expresses his distrust in
politics and confesses his difficulties to avoid subjective
interpretation of the facts during the research process.&nbsp;<font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><em>Sekonden </em>(1971) looked critically at society's need for
progress, for new records and accomplishments, and weaved together the
puzzle of a dishonest athlete and his son, whose relationship with an
East German female athlete is paralyzed. As in <i>Legionärerna</i>
Enquist approached his subject as a researcher, and used his own
experiences from sport. The work contained numerous references to the
novels of 1966 and 1968. <em>Katedralen i München </em>(1972) was based on a newspaper article Enquist wrote at the Olympic Games in 1972. </p>
<p>From 1970 to 1971 Enquist lived in West Berlin and in 1973 he was a
visiting professor at UCLA. In Los Angeles Enquist started to write his
most famous drama, <em>Tribadernas natt </em>(1975). The play depicts <a href="strindbe.htm">August Strindberg</a>'s
sexual insecurity, and his relationship with his wife Siri von Essen
and the Danish actress Marie Caroline David. Enquist used as his point
of departure Strindberg's own rehearsal of his one-act play <i>The Stronger</i>. Enquist's interpretation is distinctly at odds with Strindberg's intentions. <i>Tribadernas natt</i> was translated into twenty languages, and had more than a hundred productions, including a short run on Broadway. <em>Berättelser från de inställda upprorens tid</em> (1974), a collection of pessimistic short stories, reflected the author's six months of lecturing in California. </p>
<p>In the late 1970s Enquist moved to Copenhagen, where his second
wife, Lone Bastholm, worked as a chief of dramatic productions at the
Royal Theater. Enquist co-authored with Anders Ehnmark the play <i>Chez nous</i>
(1977), which borrowed its title from the name of a sex club in
Stockholm. Enquist's and Ehnmark's targets were the world of high
finance and the sensationalist newspapers, trade unionism and the
sports world. The sex club worked as a metaphor for economic
criminality. The play became a <i>succès de scandale </i>at Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre. One of Enquist's finest works, <em>Musikanternas uttåg </em>(The
March of the Musicians) appeared in 1978. It describes the lives and
working conditions of non-union laborers in the early years of the 20th
century, around the timber-mills of Bureå in northern Sweden. The title
of the novel was taken from a story by the Grimm Brothers, 'Town
Musicians of Bremen'. Controversially, Enquist does not glamorize
workers or the agitator Johan Elmblad, who is chased out of the
neighborhood. During the confrontation between the Social-Democratic
Party and the Christian fundamentalist, Nicanor, a young boy, helps
Elmblad. Nicanor realizes at the end that "there's always something
better than death". Enquist argues that Social Democracy has not kept
its promises and has abandoned Socialism. </p>
<p>In <em>Nedstörtad ängel </em>(1985) Enquist told three love stories
through such characters as a Mexican born with two heads, a male and
female, a schizophrenic murderer, and a woman, Bertolt Brecht's third
wife, who was confined in a mental hospital. Enquist has also written
short stories, travel books, a detective novel, and the script for Jan
Troell's film <i>Hamsun </i>(1996). It focused on the late years of
the Norwegian Nobel writer, which were shadowed by accusations of Nazi
sympathies. The film was praised by among others director Ingmar
Bergman. Enquist also collaborated with Troell in the film <em>Il Capitano</em> (1991) based on a true story dealing with the 1988 Åmsele murders.<strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<p>Enquist's literary criticism has appeared in a number of newspapers, including <i>Uppsala Nya Tidning</i>, <i>Svenska Dagbladet</i>, and <i>Expressen</i>. After the publication of <em>Kapten Nemos bibliotek </em>(1991)
Enquist said in an interview that it was his last novel. The family
tragedy was based on a real event in which the male babies were mixed
in a hospital. When the mistake is found, the nameless disturbed
narrator at the age of six is taken from his home, 'the green house',
and sent to a less prosperous home. Another child, Johannes, takes his
place. The narrator finds a refuge from Jules Verne's stories. Captain
Nemo becomes the guide into his confused mind. "The birds slept,
tightly wrapped in themselves and their dreams. Can it be that birds
dream? The mist was so low that it left only water and birds to be
seen, only a black unmoving surface of water, and endless sea. I could
imagine myself on the outermost shore, and in front of me nothingness.
An outermost boundary. And then the birds, wrapped tightly in their
dreams." </p>
<p>However, in 1999 Enquist broke his silence as a novelist with <em>Livläkarens besök</em>,
which won the August Award and the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize
2003. The protagonist is Johan Friedrich Struensee, a German doctor and
advocate of the ideas of Enlightenment. Struensee became the personal
physician to King Christian VII of Denmark (1766-1808), who suffered
from mental illness. In his position Struensee gained huge influence,
and he issued reformist statutes without the king's signature. His ally
was the strong-willed and shrewd queen, Caroline Mathilde. She bore him
a daughter. The scandalous business ended violently. Struensee was
executed when the old power, led by a palace tutor named Ove
Hoegh-Guldbergmade, made its counterattack. Enquist asks the question,
"what if an intellectual and humanist were the ruler?" Struensee thinks
he is a man of the people, but he is no politician, and in the same way
that he believes in his reforms, his opponent Guldberg, politically
more talented, also thinks that he works for justice. "Among this
book's merits is its perceptive treatment of the collision between the
sheer purity of absolute ideas, whether religious or philosophical, and
the stubborn impurity, complexity, ambiguity of actual human lives.
This collision generates an abundance of ironies. Struensee institutes
freedom of the press, only to see it exploited mainly by his enemies." <font size="2">(Bruce Bawer in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, November 18, 2001) </font></p>
<p>Enquist's play&nbsp;<em>Systrarna</em> (2000) is written for the Danish Betty Nansen theater. It is based on Anton Chechov's drama <i>The Three Sisters</i>
(1901) and his characters. It continues the series in which the author
has taken as his subject such figures as August Strindberg, H.C.
Andersen, Selma Lagerlöf, and Victor Sjöström. <em>Lewis resa </em>(2001),
about religion, love and taboos, was based on historical facts,
documentary records, and interviews. Enquist himself has said, that the
work in not a "documentary novel", although its protanogists are
real-life characters&nbsp;&#8211; Lewi Pethrus, the founder of the Swedish
Pentecostal Revival, and Sven Lidman, a poet. Enquist dedicated the
novel to his mother, who was a member of a popular revivalist movement
in Västerbotten. Also Lewi in the novel regards his mother as the most
important person in his life. </p>
