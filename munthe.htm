<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Swedish physician, psychiatrist, and writer whose best-known work is the autobiography <I>The Story of San Michele</I> (1929, Boken om San Michele). It is an account of Munthe's experience as a doctor in Paris and Rome, and in semi-retirement at 
the villa of San Michele on the island of Capri (Italy). Both realistic and mystical, the book achieved an immense popularity and has 
been translated into a number of languages. </P>

<P>Axel Munthe was born in Oskarshamn. His family originally were Flemish in origin and had settled in Sweden during the 16th century. 
Munthe's father was a pharmacist, who opened his own chemist shop  in 1850 
D&#246;derhuitsvik, later renamed Oscarshams. After marrying Aurora Ugarph, the daughter of an 
attorney, he moved to Vimmerby with his family and then to Stockholm. The atmosphere of Munthe's childhood home was strictly religious, but his father had also musical talents and the family's manor house in Beateberg outside Stockholm was a meeting place for many prominent musicians. </P>
<P>Munthe studied medicine at the University of Uppsala (1874-80) and in France at Montpellier, Paris (1880), becoming the youngest M.D. 
created at Montpellier. While living in Paris, Munthe met his first wife, Ultima Hornberg, the daughter of a chemist; 
they divorced in 1888 and Munthe left Paris.  In 1907 Munthe married Hilda Pennington-Mellor;  they had two sons.  

</P>
<P>The French neurologist Jean Martin Charcot (1825-93) and his study <I>Maladies du syst&#232;me nerveux</I> 
influenced Munthe deeply. He attended Charcot's lectures at Salp&#234;tri&#232;re Hospital and used hypnosis on his patients in 
treatments for physical and psychological disorders. However, Munthe rejected Charcot's view that a hypnotized state was very 
similar to a bout of hysteria. </P>
<P>At the age of eighteen Munthe visited Capri and decided that some day he would build a house on the island. Its loggias would 
be full of light, and there would be a small chapel, a vineyard, and old statues in the garden. After practising in Paris and 
Italy, Munthe was appointed in 1892 the physician to the Crown Princess  of Sweden and Norway, Victoria (1862-1930), who was married to Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden. Victoria spent on the island long periods for health reasons.  It was rumored that she and Munthe  were lovers. Gustaf became in 1907 the new King as Gustaf V. Though interested Italy's archeological sites, he lacked cultural interest in general and eventually wanted to stop Victoria from visiting Capri. Queen Victoria died in the Villa Svezia in Rome, where Munthe  remained by her side until her death.</P>
<P>Munthe's <I>Letters from a Mourning City</I>, (1885) described his experiences 
during the 1884 cholera epidemic in Naples. The letters first appeared in the <I>Svenska Dagblad</I>. 
Munthe wandered around the slums with a donkey, named Rosina, and the dog Puck. &quot;No doubt help has come from every part 
of the country, from every part of the world,&quot; Munthe wrote, &quot;but even here, as is so often the case, it is the poor who have exercised the greatest charity, the silent self-sacrificing devotion has come from those who have next to nothing themselves.&quot; <I>Vagaries</I> (1898) was an account of his work in Paris and Italy, where 
he lived for a time in Keats's house in Rome. Both these book were published under the name Puck Munthe. In 1903 he returned to Sweden, and spent many years as the Physician-in-Ordinary 
to the Queen. After saving enough money, Munthe built his own villa on the highest point of the island of Capri, on the site of 
the villa of the emperor Tiberius. He named his house San Michele. </P>
<P>In <I>The Story of San Michele</I>, which was written in English, Munthe depicted his life, his love for nature, and the 
colorful people he had met, among them <A HREF="maupassa.htm">Guy de Maupassant</A> and Louis Pasteur. At that time Maupassant 
was writing <I>Le Horla</I>, visions of death haunted him, and he was interested in poisons. Munthe later met the author at the 
private asylum of Dr. Esprit Blanche at Passy. He was sowing pebbles on the flower &#150; beds and explained that the pebbles would 
grow into small Maupassants if it rains. The book ends with a moving story in which the author imagines himself knocking on 
heaven's door and saints disputing angrily over his salvation. Finally two small birds, who know his good acts, call St. 
Francis and the narrator finds his peace. Munthe says in the book that it was <A HREF="hjames.htm">Henry James</A> who encouraged him to write 
about the villa. Munthe lived on Capri for over 
50 years.  </P>

<P>With his royalties from his books, Munthe financed sanctuaries for migrating birds in Capri and in Sweden, and contributed 
to charities for the poor, becoming known as &quot;the modern St. Francis of Assisi.&quot; For a time in the 1930s, he was 
entirely blind, until his sight was restored in 1934 in an operation  performed by Dr Vogt, the same doctor who had operated on 
<A HREF="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</A>.  With the help of spectacles he could read again and see the stars; "... it 
seems to me that I even see too much when I look into the faces of mhy fellow men," he wrote in a letter. By 1937, 
his sight had deteriorated again but the planned operation was never carried out. </P>
<P>During World War I Munthe worked at English hospitals, and lived then in Rome, London and Capri. In 1942 he returned to 
Sweden and spent his remaining years as a guest at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Munthe died on February 11, 1949. In his 
last will and testament he donated the villa of San Michele to the state of Sweden. Munthe's villa is situated high up on 
the rocky ledges northeast of Anacapri, at the foot of Mount Barbarossa. </P>
