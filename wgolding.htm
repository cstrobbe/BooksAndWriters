<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English novelist, who received the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1983. The choice was unexpected, because the internationally famous novelist <a href="/greene.htm">Graham Greene</a>
(1904-1991) was considered the strongest candidate from the English
writers. In many novels Golding has revealed the dark places of human
heart, when isolated individuals or small groups are pushed into
extreme situations. His work is characterized by exploration of "the
darkness of man's heart", deep spiritual and ethical questions. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Twenty-five years ago I accepted the
label 'pessimist' thoughtlessly without realising that it was going to
be tied to my tail, as it were, in something the way that, to take an
example from another art, Rachmaninoff's famous Prelude in C sharp
minor was tied to him. No audience would allow him off the concert
platform until he played it. Similarly critics have dug into my books
until they could come up with something that looked hopeless. I can't
think why. I don't feel hopeless myself." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Nobel Lecture</font></i><font size="2">, 1983)</font> </blockquote>
<p>William Golding was born in the village of St. Columb Minor in
Cornwall. His father, Alec, was a schoolmaster, who had radical
convictions in politics and a strong faith in science. Golding's
mother, Mildred, was a supporter of the British suffragate movement.
Golding started writing at the age of seven, but following the wishes
of his parents, he studied first natural sciences and then English at
Brasenose College, Oxford. Golding's first book, a collection of poems,
appeared in 1934, a year before he received his B.A. in English and a
diploma in education. </p>
<p>From 1935 to 1939, Golding worked as a writer, actor, producer, and a settlement house worker. 
In 1939 he moved to Salisbury, where he began teaching English and philosophy at Bishop Wordsworth's School. 
He married Ann Brookfield; they had two children.  In his private journal Golding described how he once
set two groups of boys against one another. These psychological experiments most likely inspired later 
his novel <i>Lord of the Flies</i> (1954). </p>
<p>During World War II,
Golding served in the Royal Navy in command of a rocket ship. His
active service included involvement in the sinking of the German
battleship <i>Bismarck</i>
in 1940 and participating in the Normandy invasion. Demobilised in
1945, Golding returned to writing and teaching, with a dark view of the
European civilization. Recalling later his war experiences, he remarked
that "man produces evil, as a bee produces honey." </p>

<p>In Salisbury Golding wrote four books, but did not get them published. 
<i>Lord of the Flies</i>, an allegorical story set in the near future
during wartime, was turned down by twenty-one publishes until it
finally accepted by Faber and Faber after substantial revisions. E.M.
Forster named it Book of the Years and in the late 1950s it became a
bestseller among American readers. At the time of its appearance,
Golding was 44, but the success of the novel allowed him to give up
teaching. In the gripping story a group of small British boys, stranded
on a desert island, lapse into violence after they have lost all adult
guidance. Ironically, the adult world is devastated by nuclear war. As
a reply to the questions of the incluence of Joseph Conrad on his work,
Golding once said: "I am pretty much tired of always being told how
much I owe to <span style="font-style: italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>. I read the book <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> I wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">Lord of the Flies!</span>" <br>
 </p>
<p><i>Lord of the Flies</i>  was followed by<i> The Inheritors </i>(1955), which overturned <a href="/hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>'s <i>Outline of History</i>
(1920) and depicted the extermination of Neanderthal man by Homo
Sapiens. Neanderthals are portrayed compassionate and communal, and
when they meet the more sophisticated Cro-Magnons, their tribe is
doomed. The Finnish professor of paleontology, <a href="bkurten.htm">Björn Kurtén</a> has offered in his novel<i> Dance of the Tiger </i>(1978)
the explanation, that the Neanderthals disappeared because they fell
fatally in love with their black and beautiful Cro-Magnon neighbours.
In <i>The Inheritors</i>, which Golding himself considered his finest
work, there is no understanding or love between these two races. First
the events are perceived from the point of view of Lok, a semi-human
creature, and after his death, the new protagonist is a Cro-Magnon,
Tuami. </p>
<p><i>Pincher Martin  </i>(1956) was story of a naval officer, Christopher Hadley Martin, who faces death after his ship is torpedoed. Like in <a href="/bierce.htm">Ambroce Bierce</a>'s 'Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge', the protagonist imagines his survival and struggle against the sea and cold<font face="Symbol">-</font>Christopher
believes he is on a rock island in Mid-Atlantic. The rock he clings is
metaphorically analogous to his diseased tooth. <i>The Free Fall</i>
(1959) was set in contemporary society. Sammy Mountjoy, the narrator,
is an artist, who looks back over his past to find the crossroads of
his life, and the moment he lost his freedom. </p>
<p>Golding resigned in 1961 from teaching and devoted himself entirely
to writing. He lived quietly in Corwall, gaining the reputation of a
mildly eccentric and reclusive person. In 1965 he received the honorary
designation Commander of the British Empire (CBE) and in 1988 he was
knighted. Golding died in Perranarworthal on June 19, 1993. The night
before his death, he made an entry in his diary and played Chopin upon
the piano. His last novel,<i> The Double Tongue</i>, left in draft at his death, came out in 1995. Set in the ancient Greece, the story
depicted the life of the last Delphic oracle, the Pythia, who witnesses
the rise of the Roman power, and the decline of the Hellenistic
culture. </p>
<p><i>The Spire</i>  (1964), which shared some motifs with <a href="imurdoch.htm">Iris Murdoch</a>'s novel <i>The Bell </i>(1958),
concerned the construction of a cathedral spire. Jocelin, a medieval
dean, has decided to erect a 400-foot spire to the top of the catdedral
before his death. But its construction causes sacrifice of others,
treachery, and murder; the Dean's own faith is tested. From this novel
Golding's work developed into three directions: novels dealing with
contemporary society without mythical substructure, the metaphysical
novels in which the theme of fall from innocence
into guilt was central, and sea novels imitating an 18th-century style.
Golding also used in his works ideas familiar from science fiction,
such as the origin of man, nuclear holocaust, and highly advanced
inventions. In the play <i>The Brass Butterfly</i>
(1958), based on Golding's short story 'Envoy Extraordinary,' an Greek
inventor Phanocles tries to get his steam engine, gun, pressure-cooker,
and printing press accepted by the Roman emperor.</p>


<p>In 1971 Golding began to keep a record of his dreams to revitalize his creative process. Prior to the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Darkness Visible</span> (1979), about saintliness and human evil, he had been silent for a long period. His later works include the historical trilogy <i>Rites of Passage</i>
(1980), which portrayed life abroad an ancient ship of the line at the
end of the Napoleonic Wars. It was awarded the Booker Prize. Other
parts of the trilogy, narrated by young Edmund FitzHenry Talbot, were <i>Close Quarters </i>(1987) and <i>Fire Down Below</i>
(1989). "The author seems intent on making the ship's voyage parallel
what is supposed to be Talbot's inner voyage of self-discovery, but
once the ship docks, the young man is little more than the opinionated
fop he was at the novel's beginning."<font size="2"> (Dierdre Bair, in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, April 2, 1989) </font> <i>The Paper Men</i>
(1984), condemned by reviewers as Golding's worst novel, was about the
battle between the world-famous English novelist Wilfred Barclay and
the American academic Rick L. Turner, who has decided to write
Barclay's biography. "In this book, however, Barclay and Tucker are not
only poorly defined as individuals, but are also wholly inadequate as
symbols. They are indeed no more than paper men." <font size="2">(Michiko Kakutani, in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, March 26, 1984) </font>
</p>
<p>Golding's most widely read work,<i> Lord of the Flies, </i>has
been translated into many languages and filmed in 1963 and 1990. It is an ironic comment on <a href="/ballant.htm">R.M. Ballantyne</a>'s <i>Coral Island</i>,
using also the names of its characters. The story describes a group of
children, who are evacuated from Britain because of a nuclear war.
Their airplane crashes on an uninhabited island, and all the adults are
killed. The boys create their own society, which gradually degenerates
from democratic, rational, and moral community to tyrannical and cruel.
"They cried for their mothers much less often than might have been
expected; they were very brown, and filthily dirty." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Lord of the Flies</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>
<p>The older boys take control, a boy called Piggy, who is asthmatic
and nearsighted, becomes a target of teasing and torment. Leaders
emerge, two of the older boys get killed, and they begin to hunt
another, just as a ship arrives. Golding's view is pessimistic: human
nature is inherently corruptible and wicked. Thus the 19th century
ideals of progress and education are based on false premises. Although
the boys have been taught social skills, their desire to kill is
unleashed when there are no strict rules of the English public-school
system to control their behavior. This is the world of freedom, that is
ruled by savages and the ultimate evil, the Lord of the Flies,
Beelzebub, Prince of Devils, whom the boys worship in the form of a
decapitated boar's head.<font size="2"> </font></p>
