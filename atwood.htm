<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Canadian poet, novelist, and
critic, noted
for her feminism and mythological themes. Margaret Atwood's work has
been regarded as a barometer of feminist thought. Her protagonists are
often a kind of "everywoman" characters, or weaker members of society.
Several of Atwood's novels can be classified as science fiction,
although her writing is above the normal formulae of the genre. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><i><font size="2">You have good bones</font></i><font size="2">,
they used to say, and I paid no attention. What did I care about good
bones, then? I was more concerned with what was covering them. I was
more concerned with lust, and pimples. The bones were backdrop. " </font></b><font size="2">(in <i>Good Bones</i>, 1992) </font></blockquote>
<p>Margared Atwood was born in Ottawa, Canada, the second of three
children. He father, Carl Atwood, was a forest entomologist, and her
mother, Margaret Killam, a nutritionist. Part of her early years Atwood
spent in the bush of northern Quebec, where her father undertook
research. "Certainly writing and art were not the foremost topics of
daily conversation in Canada when I was born&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font>
in 1939, two and a half months after the outbreak of World War II",
Atwood has said. "People had other things on their minds, and even if
they hadn't, they wouldn't have been thinking about writers." Later
Atwood's childhood experiences gave material to her metaphorical use of
the wilderness and its animals in <span style="font-style: italic;">Wilderness Tips</span> (1991). </p>
<p>In 1946 Atwood's family moved to Toronto, the scene of several of
her works. Atwood started to attended school full-time at the age of
eleven. After graduating from Leaside High School in 1959, Atwood
studied at the University of Toronto, where she met the literary critic
Northrop Fry; his myth criticism and Jungian ideas influenced her
deeply. She won a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, and became a graduate
student at Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, receiving her
M.A. in 1962. Atwood continued her studies of Victorian literature at
Harvard (1962-63, 1965-67), reading for Ph.D., but interrupted her
studies in 1967 after having failed to complete her dissertation on
'The English Metaphysical Romance.' For a period she worked for a
market-research company in Toronto and taught English at the University
of British Columbia in Vancouver (1964-65). Atwood has held a variety
of academic posts and has been writer-in-residence at numerous Canadian
and American universities. In 1967, she married James Polk, an American
postgraduate student at Harvard; they divorced in 1973. </p>
<p>As a writer Atwood made her debut at the age of 19 with <span style="font-style: italic;">Double Persephone</span>
(1961), a collection of poems on the mythologigal figure of Persephone.
Her privately printed book won the E.J. Pratt medal. Another early
collection, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Circle Game</span> (1964, rev. in 1966), marked by Gothic imagery, received the Canadian Governor General's Award for poetry in 1966.</p>
<p>While working as an editor at the Toronto publishing house Anansi in the early 1970s, Atwood published her controversial study <span style="font-style: italic;">Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature</span>
(1972). For scholars Atwood's tongue-in-cheek humour was hard to
swallow, especially when she asserted that Canadian literature has
remained blighted by subservient, colonial mentality. She returned to
the theme in Strange <span style="font-style: italic;">Things: The Malevolent North in Canadian Literature</span>
(1995). Atwood searched for the "fabled Canadian identity", stating
that "Canadians are fond of a good disaster, especially if it has ice,
water, or snow in it. You thought the national flag was about a leaf,
didn't you? Look harder. It's where someone got axed in the snow." </p>

<p>Atwood's early feminist treatise, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Edible Woman</span>
(1969), was both funny and terrifying story about a young woman, who
works for a consumer company, and stops eating after becoming engaged. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Handmaid's Tale</span> (1985) was a dystopia, influenced by <a href="../../../gorwell.htm">Orwell</a>'s classic <i>1984</i>.
The story set in the near future USA in the Republic of Gilead, a state
ruled by religious fundamentalism. All the freedoms women have gained
are revoked and language is forbidden to all but the male élite. The
narrator, Offred, is a "handmaid", valued for her ovaries. She is one
of the few women whose reproductive systems have survived the chemical
pollution and radiation from power plants. The book was filmed in 1990
by Volker Schlöndorff from a screenplay by Harold Pinter. In the film
version the protagonist becomes an active revolutionary who finally
cuts the throat of her owner. However, in Atwood's book the events are
seen through the eyes of the main character, whose weapon is irony and
keen observation <font face="Symbol">-</font> she keeps a secret
diary. Moreover, Atwood often uses a first-person narrator, whose
pespective is limited. "I try not to think too much. Like other things
now, thought must be rationed. There's a lot that doesn't bear thinking
about. Thinking can hurt your chances, and I intend to last."<font size="2"><b> </b></font><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Handmaid's Tale</font></i><font size="2">) </font>The
tale is interspersed with flashbacks to her earlier life, when she had
a husband, Luke, a 5-year-old daughter, and was allowed to read. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cat's Eye</span> (1989) told of a painter who explorers her childhood memories. <span style="font-style: italic;">Alias Grace</span>
(1996) used a genuine 19th-century criminal case of Grace Marks, one of
the most notorious women in Canada. Grace, a servant, was imprisoned in
1843, at the age of sixteen, for almost 30 years as an accomplice to
the murder of her employer Thomas Kinnear and his mistress, the
housekeeper Nancy. Her guilt was never incontrovertibly established,
but she raised the interest of journalists and researches. Before she
was arrested, she had escaped with another servant, James McDermott to
the United States. Atwood first found her story from <i>Life in the Clearings</i> (1853) by Susanna Moodie. "A lot of what is written down is either wishful thinking or spiteful gossip," Atwood has said. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Blind Assassin</span>
(2000) was about two sisters, one of whom, Laura Chase, dies in a car
accident in 1945 under ambiguous circumstances. Two years later the
body of Richard E. Griffen, a prominent industrialist, is found dead.
And in 1975 Aimee Griffen dies of a broken neck. The only person who
knows the circumstances behind these deaths is Iris Chase Griffen,
Laura's elder sister, Richard's wife, Aimee's mother. The richly
layered story then continues as a postmodern novel-within-a-novel,
using an excerpt from Laura Chase's novella, <i>The Blind Assassin</i>,
posthumously published in 1947. It deals with an affair between a
wealthy young woman and her lover, a radical on the run for. "I look
back back over what I've written and I know it's wrong, not because of
what I've set down, but because of what I've omitted. What isn't there
has a presence, like the absence of light." Much of the action consists
of a fantasy, improvised by the man, in which child carpet weavers,
blinded by the work, find new work as assassins. Atwood's novel
earned&nbsp;her in 2000 the Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award
for fiction.</p>

<p>Atwood's fiction is often symbolic. She has moved easily between
satire and fantasy, and enlarged the boundaries of traditional realism.
Her first and third novels were comic, the fourth, <span style="font-style: italic;">Life Before Man</span> (1979), presented a bleak, harsh view of human life in which marriage is a wanishing way of life.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Oryx and Crake</span>
(2003) was a love triangle set in the near-future world, where human
beings have all but destroyed the planet. "Yet for all Atwood's
imaginative powers, her meticulous research, her clever literary
allusions to Defoe, Swift and H G Wells, and her satire, this is an
unsatisfactory novel which fails to engage the reader fully." <font size="2">(Catherine Pepinster in </font><i><font size="2">The Independent</font></i><font size="2">, 1 June 2003)</font>
Some reviewers labelled the work as science fiction, but Atwood herself
considered it speculative fiction. "Had I written it 20 years ago, I
would have called it science fiction," she said in an interview, "but
now it's speculative fiction, believe me." There is no happy future for
the humankind Atwood also predicts in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Year of the Flood</span> (2009), set in an apocalyptic landscape of <i>Oryx and Crake</i>. </p><p>
Atwood has been politically active in PEN International and in Amnesty
International. She has lived since 1973 on a farm near Alliston,
Ontario, with the writer Graeme Gibson and their daughter. Atwood has
been appointed Honorary Doctor at several universities worldwide. In
1993 she was named Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts and des Lettres by
Government of France. </p>
