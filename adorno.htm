      <p>German philosopher, sociologist, and essayist, member of the
"Frankfurt School," a group of intellectuals working at the Institute
for Social Research, loosely associated to the University of Frankfurt.
Adorno's theories were much based on the writings of Hegel, Marx, and
Freud. Central in his philosophy was the dialectic method of
argumentation in which the thought proceeds by contradiction, a
collision of ideas from thesis to antithesis. From the opposites a
higher truth may be reached by synthesis, which leads to a new thesis
and so on. However, Adorno did not believe that all contradictions can
be solved and in <i>Negative Dialektik </i>(1966) he did not only
reject utopian as the possibility of total reconciliation but all
permanent concepts. Adorno's other major works include <i>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</i> (1947) and <i>Aesthetic Theory</i> (1970). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The dual nature of artworks as
autonomous structures and social phenomena results in oscillating
criteria: Autonomous works provoke the verdict of social indifference
and ultimately of being criminally reactionary; conversely, works that
make socially univocal discursive judgments thereby negate art as well
as themselves."</b> (from <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, the
son of Oskar Wiesengrund, a successful Jewish wine merchant, and Maria
Calvelli-Adorno, a Catholic of Corsican descent. Maria Calvelli-Adorno
was a professional singer, who performed with her sister, a pianist.
Adorno himself was trained in piano by Bernhard Sekles, who also taught
the future composer Paul Hindemith (1895-1963). While attending
secondary school, Adorno studied privately in 1918-19 with Siegfried
Kracauer, a German historian, social critic, and friend of the family.
In 1921 Adorno graduated from the Kaiser Wilhelm Gymnasium and entered
the newly founded Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, receiving three
years later his doctorate in philosophy in 1924. From 1925 to 1928 he
studied music composition under Alban Berg in Vienna. In 1931 he became
a lecturer at the University of Frankfurt. His thesis on Kierkegaard's
aesthetic appeared in 1933. </p>
      <p>From 1928 Adorno worked informally with the Institut für
Sozialforschung (Institute of Social Research). Its other influential
members included Max Horkheimer (1895-1973), whom Adorno had met in
1922 in a seminar, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Jürgen Habermas,
and Erich Fromm. Max Horkheimer&nbsp;was appointed&nbsp; director of
the Instititute in January, 1931. Adorno's friendship and intellectual
collaboration with Horkheimer lasted through the following decades of
his life.</p>
      <p>Besides publishing articles in the Institute's journal, <i>Zeitschrift
für Social forschung,</i>&nbsp;Adorno edited the music journal <i>Musikblätter
des Anbruchs</i> in the late 1920s. The Institute was founded to the
study of Marxism, especially Marx's early writings, and political
economy. Adorno's approach was more interdisciplinary and showed
interest in wide range of subjects from Chaplin's films and Schönberg's
atonal music to Freud's theories. In an article from 1938 ('Glosse über
Sibelius') he dismissed the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius as a
"Stravinsky against his own will. He is just less talentend." Behind
the attack was Sibelius's association with Ständige Rat für
Internationale Zusammenarbeit der Komponisten, established by Goebbels
in 1934. Practically, Adorno accepted only the music of Schönberg,
Alban Berg, and Anton Webern. Sibelius, who was outside "mainsteam"
modernism, was incorrectly associated with the "blood and soil" (Blut
und Boden) ideology of Nazism. Adorno never reconsidered his aversion
to Sibelius. The essay was included in the collection <span style="font-style: italic;">Impromptus</span> (1968). <br>
      </p>
      <p>Adorno&nbsp;also assisted the writer <a href="tmann.htm">Thomas
Mann</a>, who&nbsp;turned to&nbsp;his expertise in modern music while
writing&nbsp;in the novel <i>Doktor Faustus</i> (1949). Mann read the
manuscript of <i>Philosophie der neuen Musik</i> (1949), a defence of
Schönberg's twelve-tone system. Mann's other preparatory materials
included Adorno's essays on Wagner, which were published under the
title <i>Versuch über Wagner</i> in 1952, and Willi Reich's book <i>Alban
Berg: Mit Bergs eigenen Schriften und Beiträgen </i>(1937), to which
Adorno had contributed several essays. </p>
      <p>During the era of Nazism, the Frankfurt School was exiled to
New York City, where it continued to develop a critical theory of
society, but returned to its German home after World War II. The
school's cultural criticism and eclectic theories of mass society
influenced deeply the New left in the 1950s and 1960s. Though
the&nbsp;Frankfurt School never produced a unitary social theory, its
members shared a critical view of modern capitalism, and rejected
Soviet Communism and orthodox Marxism. </p>
      <p>After the Nazis rose to power, Adorno first fled to Oxford,
where he was registered as an advanced student in philosophy. During
this period he worked on a study of Husserl's phenomenology and
idealism. The philosopher Alfred Ayer recalled that with his snobbish
demeanour and dandified manner&nbsp;Adorno "seemed to us a comic
figure."&nbsp; In 1937 Adorno married Gretel Karplus, a chemist and
businesswoman, who was acquainted with Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch and
Bertolt Brech. <span class="st">After a period in England,&nbsp;</span>he
joined other members of the Institute at Columbia University in New
York. He worked half-time for the Institute and the other half for the
Princeton Radio Research Project, directed by Paul Lazarsfeld, the
founder of modern communications research.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Adorno spent three years in New York&nbsp;then moved to the
seaside town of Santa Monica, west of Los Angeles.&nbsp;In the Santa
Monica home of Salka Viertel he discussed with Thomas Mann the
work-in-progress, <em>Doctor Faustus</em>, and could meet there Arnold
Schönberg, Bertolt Brecht, Hanns Eisler, and Charles Laughton, too.
Because of its substantial German intellectual refugee population, the
town was sometimes called "Weimar on the Pacific". </p>
      <p>Considering himself "European through and through",
Adorno&nbsp;never felt himself&nbsp;at home&nbsp;in the United
States,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it did not stop him from&nbsp;writing
prolifically. His collection of aphorisms, <i>Minima Moralia</i>,
composed between 1944 and 1947, was first&nbsp;published in German in
1951. "I have held on to your book magnetically for several days; it
makes, day after day, for fascinating reading, though it can only be
enjoyed in small gulps, as it it the most concentrated nourishment",
Mann wrote in a letter to Adorno. <em>Composing for the Films</em>
(1947), a product of Adorno's collaboration with <a href="eisler.htm">Hanns
Eisler</a>, had been encouraged by Bertolt Brecht. It first appreared
under Eisler's name alone. A revised edition, <em>Komposition für den
Film</em> (1949),&nbsp;was published&nbsp;in Berlin by Bruno Henschel
und Sohn.&nbsp;When original version was translated and reprinted in
West Germany in 1969, Adorno was finally acknowledged as co-author. </p>
      <p><em>Dialektik der Aufklärung</em> (Dialectic of Enlightenment)
was partly based on notes taken by Gretel Karplus, during discussions
between Adorno and Horkheimer in the early 1940s.&nbsp;They argued that
reason has become an instrument of totalitarian control. "Enlightenment
behaves toward things as a dictator toward man. He knows them is so far
as he can manipulate them."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Much
of the work is devoted to study of anti-Semitism, the actual reversion
of enlightened civilization to barbarism, and the culture industry, in
which enlightenment has found its ideological expression.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The writers note that the culture industry has created
technological inventions that have made easy the control of the
individual consciousness &#8211; radio "turns all participants into listeners
and authoritatively subjects them into broadcast programs which are all
exactly the same..." Ten years later Adorno returned to the theme in
his essay 'Television and the Patterns of Mass Culture' (1954), in
which he viewed pessimistically individuals possibility to resist the
ubiquity of modern mass culture. In his essay 'Standort des Erzählers
in Zeitgenössichen Roman' (1954) he followed the thoughts of Walter
Benjamin, presented in 'Der Erzähler', and claimed that modern warfare
has made it impossible for those who have participated in the war to
return to old narrative patterns. </p>
      <p>Adorno and Horkheimer traced&nbsp;Anti-Semitism to the urge
for equality. Liberalism advocated right of man, allowed the Jews
property, but the harmony of society turned against the liberal Jews in
the form of the harmony of a national community.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"If
the masses accept the reactionary ticket which contains an anti-Semitic
component they are obeying social mechanism in which the experiences of
individual persons with individual Jews play no part. It has in fact
been found that anti-Semitism has as much chance in areas where there
are no Jews as it does, say, in Hollywood." <i>Dialectic
of Enlightenment </i>was published when the end of Nazism was in
sight. "If the arrogance of reason has led to barbarism, what is left?"
he asked. In one of his post-war essays Adorno made his famous
question, is it possible to write poetry after Auschwitz. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Life in the late capitalist era is
a constant initiation rite. Everyone must show that he wholly
identifies himself with the power which is belaboring him. This occurs
in the principle of jazz syncopation, which simultaneously derides
stumbling and makes it a rule. The eunuch-like voice of the crooner on
the radio, the heiress's smooth suitor, who falls into the swimming
pool in his dinner jacket, are models for those who must become
whatever the system wants. Everyone can be like this omnipotent
society; everyone can be happy, if only he will capitulate fully and
sacrifice his claim to happiness." </b>(</font><font size="2">The <i>Dialectic
of Enlightenment</i>, 1947)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Throughout his years in the U.S. Adorno had troubles with
publishers who wanted to edit heavily his texts. Eventually Adorno
returned to Germany, where he&nbsp;was able to settle in at his old
flat in Kettenhofveg. He worked at the Institute of Social Research,
becoming its director in 1959. On Thursday afternoons he conducted a
seminar jointly with Horkheimer, who frequently came half an hour late
and then&nbsp;offered a counter-thesis to Adorno's dialectic. Adorno
used to reply, "Exactly, that's just what I think,
Max."&nbsp;&nbsp;Horkheimer, who continued as director of the Institute
until 1958, spent a number of years teaching in the United States. </p>
      <p>From 1958 to 1969 Adorno was professor of philosophy and
sociology at the University of Frankfurt. When Adorno's appointment was
under discussion in 1956, one professor claimed that all a man needed
in Frankfurt to make a career, was to be a protegé of Horkheimer and to
be a Jew <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Martin
Heidegger</font></i><font size="2"> by </font><font size="2">R.
Safranski, 1998). </font>The most prominent thinker among the second
generation members of the Institute was Jürgen Habermas, who studied
with Adorno in the 1950s. </p>
      <p>In 1963 Adorno received the Goethe Medal. His last years were,
however, shadowed by a malicious debate about his activities in the
1930s. Adorno had published a book review in 1934 in a Nazi magazine
and quoted Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi party minister of propaganda.
Adorno admitted that the article had been a mistake. Attacks on him
continued, sometimes with anti-Semitic undertones. His stature as a
critical thinker was questioned among students, who occupied in 1968
the Institute of Sociology and Adorno called in the police. Adorno died
of a heart attack on August 6, 1969 in Visp, near Zermatt, in
Switzerland. </p>
      <p>It was not until 1972, when the founding work of Critical
Theory, <i>Dialectic of Enlinghtenment</i>, was translated into
English. His key essays on music began to appear in English in the
1970s in the journal <i>Telos</i> and later in <i>New German Critique</i>.
Adorno's last great work, <i>Aesthetic Theorie</i>, which was left
unfinished,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;posthumously in 1970. Partially against
the will of the translator, the publisher abandoned the massive spatial
organization of the text, numbered the chapters, and added main
headings and subheadings. A new translation more faithful to the
original structure was published in 1997. </p>
      <p><i>Negative Dialectics</i> (1973) stepped outside standard
Marxist framework. Adorno criticized Karl Popper and Martin Heidegger
of positing an object independent of the subject, when the object is in
fact subjectively defined. He stated that there is no absolute starting
point in metaphysics and epistemology&nbsp;&#8211; the false search for
"primac"' leads totalitarian forms of thought. To avoid fallacy of the
ultimate "identity", Adorno presented his principle of "negative
dialectics", in which all theories are systematically negated and
concepts are constantly reformed to fit the object. Heidegger was
Adorno's target in <i>The Jargon of Authenticity </i>(1964), in which
he attacked the language of existentialist thinkers. They did not meet
after 1945, and in public Heidegger never addressed a single word to
Adorno. Heidegger's main work was <i>Being and Time </i>(1927). In
the 1930s he had joined the Nazi Party. Crossing back and forth
ideological boundaries, a number of intellectuals have hailed both
Adorno and Heidegger as major aesthetic theorists and cultural critics.
Adorno himself dismissed Heidegger as "the advocate of the
unfullfilment of life", but they had much in common in their diagnosis
of the modern age. Thus it is not totally inconceivable that Herbert
Marcuse (1898-1978), who had been Heidegger's student, was also closely
associated with the Frankfurt School. In 1932 Adorno reviewed Marcuse's
study <i>Ontology and the Theory of Historicity</i>, noting that with
it he departed decisively from Heidegger's public teaching. </p>
      <p>In the difficult and aphoristic work <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>
Adorno started from his theorem that there is no philosophical first
principle. "A general theory of the aesthetically concrete would
necessarily let slip what interested it in object in the first place."
The concept of art refuses definition if one doesn't accept
alternatives between trivial universality and arbitrary judgments. From
this point of view Adorno rejects the archaic definition of aesthetics
as the theory of the beautiful: the concept of beauty is inadequate to
the full content of the aesthetic. Following Hegelian idea of art as a
product of history, Adorno sees modern art scarcely possible unless it
does experiment. More than being up to date modern art tends to oppose
the ruling Zeitgeist &#8211; arts seeks refuge in its own negation, and
nothing concerning art is self-evident anymore. "The cheap aestheticism
of short-winded politics is reciprocal with the faltering of aesthetic
power. Recommending jazz and rock-and-roll instead of Beethoven does
not demolish the affirmative lie of culture but rather furnishes
barbarism and the profit interest of the culture industry with
subterfuge. The allegedly vital and uncorrupted nature of such products
is synthetically processed but precisely those powers that are
supposedly the target of the Great Refusal: These products are the
truly corrupt."</p>
