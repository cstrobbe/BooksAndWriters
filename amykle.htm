      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Norwegian writer
who is best known for the sexually naturalistic novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangen om den røde rubin</span> (1956, The
Song of the Red Ruby), which was banned in many countries. With the
previously published <span style="font-style: italic;">Lasso rundt fru
Luna</span> (1954, Lasso Round the Moon), which described the youth of
the super-potent Ask Burlefot, Mykle provoked one of the last obscenity
trials in Norway.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I
am for ever renouncing gentleness and mercy, my way leads
to Hel. I am selling the harp of heaven and buying the boggart's
fiddle. I am abandoning people and taking citizenship in Utgard. I ask
for </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">seid</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. Do you hear, gods, </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">seid</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">!"</span> (from <span style="font-style: italic;">Lasso Round the Moon</span>) </font><br>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Agnar Mykle was born in Trondheim, the son of Ole Elias
Karlsen Myklebust, a professional musician in a military band, and Emma
Gustavsdatter Ramfjord. In his childhood Mykle suffered from asthma and
spent long period at home. Before entering at University of Economical
and Political Sciences in Bergen, Mykle earned his living in 1936-37 as
a teacher and principal at small schools in Finmark. After finishing
his studies, he continued his career as a teacher, lecturer, and took
odd jobs. He also worked closely with labour organizations. In 1936 he
married Ruth Benzen. </p>
      <p>Mykle began to write in during World War II. In 1947 Mykle
went with his second wife, Axeliane ("Jane") Christine Kielland Holm,
to Paris to study puppetry at the Académie des Compagnos de la
Marionette. He then studied theatre in England in 1951, and in the
United States on a Fulbright scholarship. These activities led to the
foundation of the Norwegian Puppet Theatre, run by Jane and Agnar
Mykle. At the Norwegian Broadcasting Company Mykle was employd by AOF,
the workers' education association, for some years. </p>
      <p>As a writer Mykle gained fame after World War II with his
semi-autobiographical novels. His first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Taustigen</span>, a collection of short
stories, came out in 1948. It was followed by<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tyven, tyven skal du hete</span> (1951),
translated into English under the title <i>The Hotel Room </i>by
Maurice Michael. The protagonist, Ash Grande has much similarities with
Ask Burlefot. Ash assaults a bigoted hotel night porter who enters a
room where he and his girlfriend are making love. In his trial for this
offense Ash reflects his past. The title of the book was from a nursery
rhyme (The thief, the thief you will be called / 'Cause you stole my
little friend). </p>
      <p><i>Lasso Round the Moon </i> was a story about young Ask
Burlefot and his hunt for ideals. He is a teacher in a small town and
manages to get two of his girlfriends pregnant. He flees and returns to
the town twelve years later as a famous composer. The Trinidadian
novelist and critic <a href="vnaipaul.htm">V.S. Naipaul</a> wrote of <i>Lasso
Round the Moon</i>: "Mykle is longwinded; he has certain rhetorical
mannerisms, and his technique is clumsy. But the sensibility is true,
the passion genuine. The book is likely to attract attention because of
its frank sexual detail. But this detail is a necessary part of Mykle's
theme, which is of development and discovery; it is of a piece with the
intensity and honesty of the book." </p>
      <p><i>Sangen om den røde rubin</i>, its sequel, was set in the
late 1930s, and depicted Burlefot in his student days in Oslo and his
affairs with women. As in the novels of D.H. Lawrence, Mykle's
characters find freedom through sexual exploration, but Burlefot is not
able to step out from the "tradition" of male subjugation of women.
Mykle's sexually explicit scenes led in 1957 to the book's prosecution
for obscenity. At the Oslo City Court it was read aloud, judged
obscene, but the verdict was overturned by the High Court in 1958. The
the juridical process made the novel an international best-seller, but
possibly it also destroyed Mykle's literary creativity, although not
his picture of himself as "the greatest writer in the world". In the
neighboring country Finland the translation of book, published by
Akirjat in 1957, was confiscated. A film version of novel was made in
1970 Denmark, starring Ole Søltoft as Ask Burlefot. The sex comedy
angred Mykle so that he declared war on Denmark. </p>
      <p>After divorce Mykle married in 1960 Toril Hofseth. In the
1960s Mykle withdrew from the publicity and Jens Bjørneboe and Knut
Faldbakken took up the role of literary provocateurs in Norway. Mykle's
      <i>Rubicon</i> (1965), which turned out to be his last novel, was
about Valemon Gristvag, who motorcycles across Hitler's Germany to
France in the summer of 1939. After the short story collection<span style="font-style: italic;"> Largo</span> (1967) Mykle stopped
publishing. A reviewer in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> wrote
that the book "moves like some solems, slow Scandinavian film lingering
on flesh, idyllic landscape and sinful man." Although <i>Sangen om den
røde rubin</i> made the author famous and was translated into many
languages, Mykle was forced to borrow money from his editor, Harald
Grieg at Norsk Gyldendal Forlag, without being able to pay them back.
Mykle died in 1994, in Asker, where he lived with Jane after his third
divorce. Mykle contributed to several Norwegian papers. His essays and
letters were published in three volumes in 1997-98. According to Anne
Luise Kirkengen's doctoral thesis, Mykle was a victim of sexual abuse
by his mother. </p>
