<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Prolific Norwegian novelist, poet, playwright and critic. Carling's career as a writer  
spanned over 50 years. In his works Carling dealt with the themes of estrangement and isolation. 
He also published documentary accounts of groups feared or ignored by society &#8211; the blind, homosexuals, 
the terminally ill. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Jeg er betatt av kvinnelige forfattere,
av deres rikdom og nærhet til detaljer. De skriver så man kjenner
duften og smaken på deres ord. Virginia Woolf, Nadine Gordimer, Doris
Lessing &#8211; herregud som jeg misunner dem denne evnen . . ." </b></font><font size="2">(Carling in</font><i><font size="2"> Aftenposten Morgen </font></i><font size="2">16/9 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>Finn Carling was born in Oslo into an upper-middle-class family, the
son of Bjarne Carling and Sigrid Schultz. Carling spent his growing
years in the pleasant suburb of Smested, where later lived in a house
built beside his childhood home. Among his favorite books in his youth
was Rosamund Lehmann's <i>Dusty Answer</i>, a story about 
loneliness, dreams, and young love. The author was 20 when she wrote the work. <br>
</p>
      <p>In his childhood Carling created a fantasy world, which was a
source for inspiration for his later writings. He studied psychology at
the University of Oslo but never got his degree &#8211; from early on, he had
a passion for writing. In 1962-64 he studied sociology on a grant at
Howard University in America. As a writer Carling made his debut in
1949 with <i>Broen</i>, an experimental work which consisted 
of two short stories, and the one-act play <i>Glasskulen</i>.  Carling's other dramas include <i>Gitrene</i> (1966), 
based on the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac, <i>Slangen</i> (1970), and <i>Skudd</i> (1971). </p>

<p>Carling's lifelong struggle with his affliction &#8211; he was born with cerebral palsy  &#8211;  is seen 
in his novels, especially in the theme of human isolation and in his essays about 
society's outsiders, the elderly, and misfits,  
but in spite of his severe disability Carling was known among his friends 
for his strength and good humor. He was a sought-after lecturer and he made several travels to Africa. <br>
</p>
      <p>In his autobiography, <i>Kilden og muren</i> (1958, And Yet We Are Human), 
Carling wrote: "My life, I told my friend, did not differ from the lives of other people, 
although my childhood, of course, had in some ways been different from that of a 
physically normal boy, since I could not walk until the age of fifteen, but had to crawl 
on my knees to get around." After publishing poems, articles, and plays Carling again turned his interest 
to the novel and themes of illusion, fantasy, and myth. The provocative Norwegian 
writer Jens Bjørneboe (1920-1976) criticized Carling, a prominent figure 
of modernism, that in <i>Desertøren</i> (1956) he ignored action, the basis of a story, 
and focused instead on words and thoughts. </p>

<p><i>Kometene </i>(1964) was about a family whose members spend their isolated lives like 
comets in cold space, never coming near each other. A death in the family causes the first 
signs of a change in the regular course of life. In <i>Gjesten</i> (1970) Carling dropped 
his experiments with narrative technique and told about a small family, a father and his 
daughter and son. In the center of the story is the daughter who grows from a child into a 
young woman during a few summer days. Inside this simple frame the author spins a net of 
dreams, anticipations, and hidden meanings. The protagonist of <i>Brevene</i> (1980) is 
an ordinary woman, Gertrud Angell, who suddenly starts to behave strangely and finally is 
shut up in a mental hospital. Her change is depicted through the eyes of her husband and 
other members of the family. Their reactions reveal more about themselves than Gertrud's 
crisis. </p>
<p><i>Commission</i> (1991) is one of Carling's best-known works in the English-speaking world. 
In the story a nameless writer staying in Corsica tries to solve the mystery 
of Sebastian, a depressive and a playboy. During this search he meets people close 
to him, among them a brother engaged on animal experiments. The writer &#8211; in the text 'one' &#8211; 
tries to help a dog that has been tormented by children and could be an embodiment of 
Sebastian himself. "A rage one has never felt before is almost bursting one apart. 
A rage against violence and injustice. In a world like ours, why hasn't one felt 
it before? Was it such feelings that drove Sebastian in his fight against oppression." </p>
<p>In <i>Dagbok til en død </i>(1998, Diary for a Dead Husband), Beatrice, a dutiful 
middle-aged woman, goes through a period of introspection after her husband's death of a 
heart attack. In this process Beatrice discovers a wide gap between her own dreams and 
what her friends and children expect from her. Beatrice has lived in the shadow of her 
domineering husband, and her diary becomes a vehicle for self-awareness and a freedom that she had 
not known existed. "First time a tap began to leak or the car refused to start, 
I was helplessly alone. Not lonely. You took care of practical matters in the forty 
years we were married. You were married." The story is carefully structured, 
and written in almost minimalist style, which  marked Carling's work in general. </p>
<p>In 1992 Carling was awarded Humanistpriset and in 1999 he received the Norwegian 
Council for Cultural Affairs prize. Carling died in Oslo on March 12, 2004. 
He was married three times; first to Åse Weidemann; then to Kitty (&#8220;Noffi&#8221;) Ringnes. His third wife was Anne Carling, a 
writer. Her first fictional work, <i>En´søster er en søster er 
en søster</i>, came out in 1999. </p>



<blockquote><font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">Robert
Turner smiled. But my dear chap, he said, in the first place we have
our agreement about utter frankness, and in the second we are
experienced men who know about most things in life, who know indeed
that the lust of the flesh sometimes leads to the destruction of the
body. I've seen especially among my artist friends how a wild life in
youth has led to an early death in the madhouse. I was once shown a
brain that had belonged to one of our most gifted illustrators who
unfortunately ended his days like this, and it had become as smooth as
a plum and so shrunken that it could have lain in a child's hand.
Naturally I can't disclose his name to you - can merely say that he was
quite close to me at one period. But your illness hasn't progressed so
far in any case, for, from what I can judge, your sanity is still
intact.</font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">I think so, said the guest in a low voice.<br>
</font><font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">It's
interesting, by the way, Robert Turner continued, that while to begin
with I knew I had heard the name of your illness but was unable to
recall in what connection, it suddenly dawned on me during our
conversation just now that there was once a German writer called Hedwig
Courths-Mahler who wrote rather unimportant novels about trivial,
sentimental love. It would undoubtedly have been an amusing whim of
fate if, for instance, her brother or her son was the doctor who gave
his name to the disease you suffer from.</font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">Once again the
guest reddened. Not because Robert Turner had so intimately described
the very tragic course of the illness from which he obviously believed
his guest suffered, but because he was afraid that Robert Turner
actually understood that there was no such thing as Courths-Mahler's
Disease. That he had just pulled the name out of the air. Or, more
correctly, that it had bobbed to the surface of his consciousness as a
distant memory of a book, probably one in a bookcase at the home of an
old aunt with a weakness for sentimental novels. Again in the hope of
saving a desperate situation, he said, in a low voice and with a
carefully calculated side glance at the guests at the other tables:
Courths-Mahler's Disease doesn't affect the brain.</font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">What does it affect, then? asked Robert Turner.</font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">The heart, the
guest whispered, still with the vague backing of his aunt's modest
bookcase. But that only happens after many years, for the disease
becomes encapsulated and just lies there as a hidden poison in the
body.... At any rate, that was how the doctors explained it to me, he
added uncertainly.</font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">And soon you'll die, then?</font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">Yes, said his guest.</font><br>
<font color="White" size="2">----</font><font size="2">Death was an
occurrence that Robert Turner didn't consider worth mentioning. He had
mentioned earlier, after all, that he himself had experienced it
physically and that people's anxieties about it were, in his opinion,
greatly exaggerated. Therefore he turned without so much as a
sympathetic nod back to the real problem - namely, which interesting
dishes would make the forthcoming meal a perfect ending to a radiant
day. Not for a moment did it occur to Robert Turner that this, in his
judgement, rather uncultivated guest would be capable of offering
advice in matters of a culinary nature, and if, contrary to his
presumption, that actually happened, he naturally wouldn't have dreamed
of taking any notice of it. But simply because he liked to think aloud,
he leaned back in his chair all the same and asked pleasantly: What do
you think about a fakes soupa to begin with? It's still quite hot, you
know, what with the sun roasting away all day. Don't you think too that
a soup like that's the very thing that might refresh us? <br>
