<p>Estonian poet, essayist, and novelist, who was especially known for
his historical novels, although he started as a renewer of poetic form
and content. Jaan Kross's central characters are generally outsiders,
sharp observers, or strong-willed idealists, who face a difficult
choice between compromising their values and beliefs or colliding with
the broader realities of history and politics. Kross was often
mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Strange, how people try to improve
things by simply insisting that they are, or will be, better than they
really are. I am guilty of that myself; no doubt about it. One might
say that it is a professional habit of mine..." </b>(from <i>Professor Martens' Departure</i>, 1984) </font></blockquote>
<p>Jaan Kross was born in Tallinn. His father, also Jaan, was a
machine-tool foreman, and mother, Pauline Kristine (Uhlberg) Kross, the
daughter of a blacksmith. After attending the Jakob Westholm Grammar
School, Kross entered in 1938 the University of Tartu, where he studied
law, and then, in 1944-46, worked as a lecturer of international law.
He also wrote poems which were published in magazines and decades later
in <i>Voog ja kolmpii</i> (1971). In 1940 he married Helga Pedussaa, a philology studentr; the marriage ended in divorce. </p>
<p>During WW II, Estonia was first occupied by the Red Army and then by
Germany. For a period Kross was employed as a translator for the
newspaper <i>Postimees</i>. He managed to avoid military service, but
eventually he was assigned to work as a German interpreter. In 1944 he
was arrested by the Nazis. Kross spent about five months in jail before
he was released. In 1944 Estonia was incorporated into the USSR as the
Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. A number of writers and
intellectuals, including Marie Under, Henrik Visnapuu, Artur Adson,
Karl Ristikivi, <a href="uibopuu">Valev Uibopuu</a>, and Bernard Kangro, chose emigration over life under Soviet occupation, but Kross decided to return to Tartu. </p>
<p>Kross's father was sent to the Gulag in Mordva in 1945; he died a
year later. Kross himself was arrested in 1946 by the NKVD. He spent
about eight years in exile and hard labour camps in the Komi and
Krasnoyarsk regions. Most of the prisoners there were Russians, but in
Intan his Gulag inmates included a German doctor of history and a
Viennese masseur. Later Kross returned to this period of his life in
the short stories 'Halleluuja' (1990) and 'Vürst' (1994), and in <i>Kallid kaasteelised</i> (2003), a book of memoir. </p>
<p>In 1953, Kross married Helga Roos, a translator, whom he had met in
the Gulag; they had one daughter. While at university, Kross had tried
to write a novel and but in exile Kross took up poetry. He also
translated poems by <a href="/blok.htm">Aleksander Blok</a>. Following
"the thaw" after Stalin's death, Kross was pardoned. In 1954, against
all odds, he was back in Tallinn, where he devoted himself entirely to
writing, first as a poet and translator of such classics Shakespeare,
Balzac, and Lewis Carroll. </p>
<p> During the post-war decades in Estonia, writers played cat and
mouse with the censor. The restrictions on free expression were not so
effective as Moscow expected them to be, and the ideology of Socialist
realism never gained a mandatory control of literature in the country.
As a reaction to the ideological straitjacket, writers experimented
from the 1960s with new techniques and adopted absurdist, surrealist or
existentialist approach to the tension between art and the Soviet
reality. Occasionally censors turned a blind eye when writers ignored
the directions they were given. "Some of my work obviously got
published only thanks to such occurrences," Kross has said. However,
before the international breakthrough of such writers as Kross, Mati
Unt, and poet Jaan Kaplinski, its was ofted claimed that the quality
and quantity of literary production in exile surpassed that in Estonia.
</p>
<p>Kross has been credited for being the first to broke the Socialist
Realism mode and introduced new themes to Estonian poetry. Some of the
poems of his first collection, <i>Söerikastaja</i> (1958), Kross had
composed while in exile. In the fablelike 'Irax', supposedly set in the
ancient Middle East, Kross satirized a Shah's governor, who is
flattered and praised ad nauseam. The poem, written before Stalin's
death, was taken as a criticism of Stalinism. <i>Söerikastaja</i> was widely reviewed and most of the reviews were very favorable, though the most influential literary paper, <i>Sirp ja Vasar</i> (sickle and hammer),  attacked it with the notorious label of "decadent". This collection was followed by <i>Kivist viiulid</i> (1964), <i>Lauljad laevavööridel</i> (1966) and <i>Vihm teeb toredaid asju</i> (1969). </p>
<p>With his third wife, the poet and translator Ellen Niit, whom he had
married in 1958, Kross traveled in 1964 in Egypt and published with her
a travel book, <i>Muld ja marmor</i> (1968). In  1962 Kross moved with his family to Tallinn's Writers House. </p>
<p>From the beginning, Kross fiction had included historical subjects,
but it was not until in the 1970s, when Kross turned seriously his
attention to the historical novel. Besides being a national memory,
history offered a seemingly neutral way to explore national and ethical
questions, the role of the intelligentsia and political opportunism,
and the artistic freedom of expression. His first novel Kross published
in 1970, at the age of 50. <i>Neli monoloogi Püha Jüri asjus</i> (1970) told about the Estonian renaissance artist Michel Sittow  (1469-1525).</p>
 

<p>Kross's magnum opus was <i>Kolme katku vahel</i> (1970-1980), set in
the 16th century, originated from a shelved screenplay. The central
character is Balthasar Russow, a Lutheran pastor and chronicler, whose <i>Chronicle of Livonia</i> is born under the pressure of Lutheran orthodoxy <font face="Symbol">-</font>
an obvious parallel to Kross's own experiences as a writer more or less
tolerated by the Soviet censorship. Kross himself admitted in <i>Omaeluloolis ja alltekts</i> (1998), that out of all of his fictional characters, he was most like Russow. </p>
<p>Kross alter egos in his fiction were Peeter Mirk and Jaak Sirkel,
whose experiences in the 1940s and 1950s the author depicted in his
short stories and the books <i>Wikmani poisid</i> (1988), <i>Silmade avamise päev</i> (1988), and <i>Väljakaevamised</i> 1990. </p>
<p>Estonia declared its full independence in 1991 and in the same year
Kross became the oldest member of the parliament, where he participated
in the drafting of the new constitution. He was also appointed to head
the commission for investigation into the KGB. </p>
<p>In the new political situation,  Kross published  several works, in which he analyzed the Soviet period, including <i>Paigallend</i>
(1998). The story, narrated by Jaak Sirkel, depicts the life of Ullo
Paerand, an intellectual, poet, polyglot, and the secretary of the
prime minister. He is also blessed with a brilliant memory, perhaps too
good for his own sake. Decided to stay in his home country, whatever
the costs are, Ullo chooses the life of a humble man and worker in a
suitcase factory. Through the tale runs a tragic undercurrent of
international politics: after WW II, Estonia was left alone by the
West. After the original manuscript of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tahtamaa</span> (2001) disappeared, Kross&nbsp;<em></em>reconstructed
it from his memory, which was exceptionally good. While finishing the
novel, Kross had a brain infarct. This work, set in modern-day Estonia,
received mixed reviews but sold well. <br>
</p>

<p>Kross's works have been published in about 20 languages and sold
more than one million copies worldwide. "His life has encompassed
Estonia's roller-coaster story to the point that he is seen as a
representative and spokesman by his contemporaries,"<b> </b>wrote <a href="dlessing.htm">Doris Lessing</a> on the author in <i>The Spectator</i> <font size="2">(June 28, 2003)</font>.
Kross's novels of Estonian history, set in a wider European context,
have been compared to the old tradition of Tolstoy and Thomas Mann.
History in Kross represents the immediate experience, inner events.
Especially in the structure of his novels, a clear distinction is made
between what is officially known and what were the real events. </p>
<p>Against the background of a thoroughly researched historical period,
Kross often relateed the account of a witness of his time, sometimes
employing the interior monologue. One of Kross's most sympathetic
figures is the legal scholar and statesman F.F. Martens in <i>Professor Martens' Departure</i>
(1984), who on a train bound to St.Petersburg summarizes his life and
doings, the compromises he has made. At one point he admits that if he
could start his life over again, he would do everything the same way. <br>
</p>
      <p>With the translation of <i>The Czar's Madman</i> (1978), Kross
gained a wide audience in the English-speaking world. Written in the
form of a secret diary, the narrator is the brother-in-law of Timotheus
von Bock, a real historical figure, a visionary and hero, who opposed
Tsar Alexander I,<b> </b>his boyhood friend, and was  condemned insane.  Berend Falck, the narrator of <i>Rakvere romaan</i>
(1982), is a tutor, who works for the aristocracy but whose heart is on
the side of the rising bourgeoisie. Again Kross depicted a character
who tries balance between what he says and writes and what he really
thinks. </p>

<p>Kross received several awards, including the Finnish Eeva Joenpelto
Award in 1988, the French Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger in 1989, the
Amnesty International Golden Flame Prize in 1990; the National Cultural
award in 1998, annual award of the Estonian Cultural Endowment in 1998,
and the Baltic Assembly prize for literature in 1999. The second volume
of his memoirs <i>Kallid kaasteelised</i>, which Kross finished before his death on December 27, 2007, came out in 2008. </p>
