<p>English science-fiction writer, who gained fame with his catastrophe novels <i>The Day of the Triffids</i> (1951), <i>The Kraken Wakes </i>(1953), and <i>The Chrysalids</i>
(1955). The central theme in Wyndham's major works is the struggle for
survival in extreme situations. His heroes are often ordinary people,
who try to sustain civilized values, when the normal social system has
collapsed. The famous American writer Stephen King has called Wyndham
"perhaps the best writer of science fiction that England has ever
produced". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The way I came to miss the end of the
world - well, the end of the world I had known for close on thirty
years &#8211; was sheer accident: like a lot of survival, when you come to
think of it. In the nature of things a good many somebodies are always
in hospital, and the law of averages had picked on me to be one of them
a week or so before. It might just as easily have been the week before
that-in which case I´d not be writing now: I´d not be here at all."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Day of the Triffids</font></i><font size="2">, 1951) </font></blockquote>
<p>John Wyndham was born John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris in the
village of Knowle, in Warwickshire. His father, George Beynon Harris,
was a barrister. Gertrude Parkes, Wyndham's mother, was the daughter of
an ironmaster. Untill 1911, he lived in Edgbaston, Birmingham. When
Wyndham was eight, his parents separated. Wyndham and his brother,
Vivian Beynon Harris, who also became a writer, moved with their mother
from place to place. However, their childhood was not unhappy; "we
loved our mother and each other and we were as close as it is possible
for a family to be," recalled Vivian Beynon Harris later. Reading <a href="hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>'s <span style="font-style: italic;">The Time Machine</span> first aroused his interest in science fiction. Moreover, in many ways Wyndham could be called the natural successor to Wells. <br>
 </p>
<p>Wyndham attended several private preparatory schools. He left in
1921 Bedales School in Petersfield, Hampshire, and then studied
farming. He also read for the Bar and tried advertising, before turning
to writing in 1925. Living mostly on a small allowance from his
parents, Wyndham poured out stories. However, it was not until 1929,
when rejection slips stopped coming. <br>
</p>
      <p>Inspired by the magazine<i> Amazing Stories</i>, he wrote from
1930 to 1939 almost exclusively for the American pulp magazines. Among
his early works was 'Words to Barter', which appeared in <i>Wonder Stories</i> in 1931.  His short stories from this period, signed as John Beynon Harris, were assembled as <i>Wanderers of Time</i> (1973). The title story originally appeared in <i>Wonder Stories</i>
and was reprinted as a separate pamphlet. 'The Lost Machine' (1932),
one of Wyndham's most anthologized works, which was published first in <i>Amazing Stories</i>,
is a predecessor to Isaac Asimov's robot tales. Its narrator is a
machine from Mars,
lost on the third planet, the earth. "I know what it is to be an
intelligent machine in a world of madness," the visitor concludes
before dissolving itself. </p>

<p>Wyndham's first novel, <i>The Secret People </i>(1935),   came out in a serialized from in the English magazine <i>Passing Show</i>,
and then as a book under the pseudonym John Beynon. Set in the Sahara,
where part of the desert has been flooded, the story tells of hero and
heroine, who find in subterranean caves a race of pigmies. The
"submerged nation" theme was derived from Wells's famous novel <i>The Time Machine</i> (1895). Another Wells' novel which influenced Wyndham was <i>War of the Worlds</i> (1898). <i>Planet Plane</i> (1936), Wyndham's second serial, was a space opera about the first  flight to Mars, where the Martians are a dying species. <i>Foul Play Suspected</i> (1935) differed from his other works &#8211; it was  a detective story. 
</p>
<p>Before World War II, Wyndham wrote as John Beynon and John Beynon
Harris &#8211; Wyndham used several differed pseudonyms, most of which he
derived from his own name. Some of his science fiction adventures and
juveniles appeared also in British magazines. The war interrupted
Wyndham's career. He wrote poetry and translated some French plays, but
the science fiction market collapsed, when both science-fiction fans
and writers were called up. From 1940 to 1943 Wyndham worked in
censorship, and in 1944 he participated in the Invasion of Normandy.
Wyndham was a corporal cipher operator in the Royal Signal Corps. </p>
<p>The  dropping of the atom bomb, the beginning of the Cold War, <b> </b>and
fears of Communism and nuclear war brought new seriousness into science
fiction. After the war Wyndham's career as a writer was for a few years
in a dead end. At the exclusive Penn Club in Beford Place, Wyndham met
the publisher (Sir) John Lusty, who advised him on his next novel. It
was <i>The Day of the Triffids</i>, which was immediately hailed as
the "most terrifying as well as the best-written science fiction novel
of the year, or for several years." The book was translated into
numerous languages, among others into Finnish, and adapted into screen
in 1963. Before published in hard-cover form in England, the story
appeared in serialized form in the American magazine <i>Colliers Weekly</i>. </p>
<p> <i>The Day of the Triffids</i> revised and updated the theme of
disaster. In the story, a rain of meteors, mysterious "green flashes,"
have caused mass blindness on earth. Triffids, mobile carnivorous
plants, on average 7 feet high, emerge from an agricultural experiment,
and take advantage of a world struck blind. A small group of people try
to cope with the deadly vegetables. The chief protagonist is Bill
Masen, a horticulturist and triffid expert. He still has his sight,
because he was in a hospital and was blindfolded during a treatment.
With his newly acquired family, he tires to avoid being enslaved by the
blind. In the Isle of Wright, their haven, they hope to establish a new
society. According to an anecdote, Wyndham overheard in a pub two
gardeners discussing their weeds. One said: "There's one by my tool
shed &#8211; a great monster. In reckon it's a triffid!" After the
publication of the book, the word "triffid" has come to mean almost any
kind of imaginary hostile and dangerous plant. Wyndham's species refers
to the three roots, on which the plants move. </p>
<p>Steve Sekely's film version from 1963 was written by the blacklisted
scenarist Bernard Gordon, who did not get screen credit. Gordon ended
his script on a positive note of humanity. "For me," he said in an
interview, "the problem of the book... was that the story meandered
through many episodes and never came to a meaningful end." William
Faulkner's speech to the Nobel Committee gave Gordon a clue how finish
the picture with the saying, "since life on earth arose from the sea,
it would be that same broth of seawater that saves life on earth as we
know it. And with the help of a bit of seawater, man would eventually
triumph even over the triffids." <font size="2">(from </font><font size="2"><i>Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist</i></font><font size="2">by Patrick McGilligan and Paul Buhle, 1999) </font></p>
<p>Although Wyndham did not invent the English disaster novel, he
reestablished the genre and examined its themes and possibilities with
the fresness of a pioneer. Wyndham's down-to-earth attitude made his
stories so believable, that he was marketed in the UK as a mainstream
writer. Wyndham himself never loved the term 'science fiction.'
Starting from a fantastic premise, he logically developed situations,
in which the effects of his idea are set against a comfortable English
background. The tone of his stories is calm and practical. His style
led one reviewer to describe him as "the Trollope of science fiction.".
Brian Aldiss and David Wingrove have characterized him as the "master
of the cosy catastrophe." As a number of other Cold War writers,
Wyndham constantly contrasted individualism and collectivism and the
breakdown of established social order. Thus the end of the civilization
can come in the form colonies of telepathic children, who do not have
individual spirits, or spiders start to cooperate, hunt in packs, or
quasi-intelligent plants threaten the very existence of mankind. </p>
<p>Wyndham wrote his most memorable novels in the 1950s. <i>The Kraken Wakes</i> (1953) repeated the 
formula of <i>The Day of the Triffids</i>, but this time the civilization is threatened by invaders 
from space, who melt down the polar ice caps. The aliens live at the bottom of the oceans. Eventually 
its is discovered, that they can be killed with the help of ultrasound probes.  Wyndham's protagonist, 
who narraters the story with a kind of stoic humor<i></i>, is more an observer than participant of 
the events. The word "kraken" comes from Norwegian; in <i>Natural History of Norway</i> 
(1752-54) the Dane Erik Pontoppidan, Bishop of Bergen, said that the Kraken's back is a mile and a 
half wide and its tentacles are capable of encompassing the largest of ships. The title of Wyndham's 
book refers to a sonnet by Alfred Tennyson, which begins: "Below the thunders of the upper 
deep, / Far, far beneath the abysmal sea, / His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep / The Kraken 
sleepeth..." A new version of the theme was introduced in Frank Schätzing&#8217;s 
novel <i>Der Schwarm</i>
(2004, The Swarm), in which an unknown intelligent creature, living in
the ocean bed, defends itself against the destruction caused by
mankind. </p>
<p><i>The Chrysalids </i>(1955) was set in the future world, devastated by nuclear war. Survivors in puritanical communities<b> </b>kill all mutants, human and non-human<b>. </b>Through
the fate of novel's young protagonist, David Storm, Wyndham exemplifies
the conflict between official truths and personal, inner beliefs. David
has a limited form of telepathy, which he tries to hide, but at home he
is surrounded by a series of plagues: <font size="2">ONLY THE IMAGE OF
GOD IS MAN; KEEP PURE THE STOCK OF THE LORD; IN PURITY OUR SALVATION;
BLESSED IS THE NORM, and WATCH THOU FOR THE MUTANT! </font> </p>
<p><i>The Midwich Cuckoos</i> (1957) set the theme of disaster inside
families &#8211; world peace is not threatened by aliens but children. In a
small English village aliens mysterious impregnate the entire female
population. Their golden-eyed children, the "cuckoos" of the title, are
superior beings, and create a moral dilemma: on the other hand, the
authorities want to liquidate them because they will eventually
extinguish human culture, but on the other hand, "it is our culture
that gives us scruples about the ruthless liquidation of unarmed
minorities". This story was filmed in the 1960s twice. Wolf Rilla's <i>Village of the Damned</i> (1960) was faithful to Wyndham's work.  Anton Leader's re-make <i>Children of the Damned</i>
(1963) transported the children to London. In 1995 the American
director John Carpenter made his own version, starring Christopher
Reeve, Kirstie Alley, and Linda Kozlowski. The settings of the purely
Hollywood production were far from the sleepy English village of
Midwich. Ralph Thomas's film <i>Quest for Love</i> (1971), starring
Tom Bell, Joan Collins and Denholm Elliott, was based Wyndham's short
story 'Random Quest' (1961), one of his weakest. Bell played a
scientist, who is transported after a scientific experiment into a
parallel world, where he falls in love with Joan Collins, the wife of
his alter ego. When she dies, he tries to find her counterpart from our
own world, hoping to save her. The story has been adapted to a
television film in 1969 and 2006.</p>
<p><i>The Web</i> (1979) depicted the beginning of a world take-over by
spiders. In the characters of Walter Tirrie, "persistent setter-right
of the world" and Lord Foxfield, a millionaire idealist, Wynham also
mocked those who want to build an Utopian society, believing that
mankind is the mightiest species in the creation. "Most of the conflict
in the world reflects the conflict in our minds as we strive to move
forward while the brakes of false doctrines, superstitions, obsolete
standards, and misconceived ambitions are always at work on us. These
checks are build-in, we cannot free ourselves from them, but we can
loosen them for others. If we provide the right conditions, as free
from contaminations as possible, there is hope that in a generation, or
in two or more generations, they may cease to bind." Lord Foxfield's
Enlightened State Project on the South Pacific island of Tanakuatua is
stopped by spiders. And again, behind the disaster is human
foolishness, a nuclear test and a mutation caused by the radioactive
contamination. Wyndham's work owes much to H.G. Wells's <i>The Island of Doctor Moreau</i> (1896), but its conservative arguments reflected the political change in<b> </b>  the United Kingdom &#8211; <i>The Web</i>  appeared in the same year, when Margaret Thatcher was appointed prime minister. </p>
<p>Wyndham lived a quiet life in a country house near Petersfield. In
1963 he married Grace Wilson, a teacher and a member of the Penn Club,
whom he had met already in the 1930s. They had no children. Wyndham
disliked personal publicity, saying: "My life has been practically
devoid of interest to anyone but myself &#8211; though I have quite enjoyed
it, of course, in those moments when I did not seem to have been sent
to occupy a largely lunatic world." John Wyndham died on March 11,
1969, in Petersfield. Decades after his death, his books still appeared
regularly on school syllabuses in the UK. </p>
