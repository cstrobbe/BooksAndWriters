<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American novelist, essayist, and travel book writer, best known for his massive and detailed novels (<i>Hawaii</i>, <i>Centennial</i>, <i>Texas</i>,
etc) many of which were created in his workshop with assistants and
researchers. Michener wrote his first book at the age of thirty-nine
and immediately won a Pulitzer Prize. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am a humanist because I think humanity
can, with constant moral guidance, create reasonably decent societies.
I think that young people who want to understand the world can profit
from the works of Plato and Socrates, the behaviour of the three
Thomases, Aquinas, More and Jefferson - the austere analyses of
Immanuel Kant and the political leadership of Abraham Lincoln and
Franklin Roosevelt." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The World is My Home</font></i><font size="2">, 1992) </font></blockquote>
<p>According to his own words James A. Michener was a foundling without
knowledge of his birth-place or date; according to other sources he was
born in New York and taken as an orphan to Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He
was raised by Mabel Michener, a Quaker widow of a man named Edwin
Michener.&nbsp;Mabel supported her&nbsp;family&nbsp;with her meagre
income&nbsp;as a seamstress, doing&nbsp;the neighbours'
laundry&nbsp;and by taking in orphaned children. At one time, thirteen
children lived undet the same roof.&nbsp; The family constantly moved
from one low-rent house to another. </p><p>At the age of eleven or
twelve, Michener had his first salaried job&nbsp;&#8211; he cultivated
floering plants at the&nbsp;local&nbsp;Burpee Seed Company's meadows.
Michener started to write a sports column at the age of fifteen for the
local newspaper and edited the high school student paper. From his
early youth, Michener was a voracious reader and he listened to opera.
His Uncle Arthur gave the family a Victorola, a record player, and
three records, <em>Cohen on the Telephone</em>, <em>The Stars and Stripes Forever</em>, and the sextette from <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, backed by the quartet from <em>Rigoletto</em>.&nbsp;From
the moment he heard the quartet he began to collect operatic records.
Michener also started to collect reproductions of paintings. His
favorite artists&nbsp;included the Dutch painter Carel Fabritius
(1622-1654), the Italian Renaissance artist Benozzo Gozzoli,
(1420-1497), and Ando Horoshige (1797-1858), the Japanese woodblock
artist.&nbsp;</p><p>While at&nbsp;high school and college Michener
hitchhiked to all parts of America, and he continued to travel widely
throughout his life in different parts of the world. "I was in many
ways the poorest boy on the road, in others the richest," Michener has
recalled,&nbsp;"and I was always happy to be on the road meeting new
people, hearing new stories and seeing new landscapes."&nbsp;From 1950
through 1953, he reported on the Korean War, he operated in 1956 behind
Russian lines during the Hungarian Revolution, in 1963 he spoke for the
liberation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in Leningrad, in 1964 he
travelled in the Russian provinces adjoining Afghanistan, in 1972 he
accompanied President Nixon on his visit to Moscow, Iran, and Poland,
from 1972 through 1981, he visited Poland nearly a dozen times, and in
1972 he was with Nixon in China. </p>
<p>Michener majored in English at Swarthmore College, where he had
success as an athlete in basketball, baseball, and tennis. His B.A
degree Michener took in 1929. Upon receiving a Lipincott traveling
grant, he&nbsp;attended St. Andrew´s in Scotland, and studied Italian
art in Siena and at the British Museum in London. He also collected
folksongs in the Hebrides and visited Spain while a crew member on a
freighter. In 1935 Michener graduated from the University of Northern
Colorado with an M.A. </p>
<p>From 1929 to 1931 Michener was employed as a master at the Hill
School in Pottstown and from 1934 to 1936 at the George School in
Newtown, Pennsylvania. He was a professor at the University of Northern
Colorado (1936-40), and then visiting professor of history at Harvard's
School of Education (1940-41). His first publications were articles in
professional journals. When the United States entered World War II
Michener worked as a textbook editor in New York City. Although as a
Quaker he was exempt from actual military service, he decided to enlist
in the United States Navy. His wife Patti Koon served with Eisenhower's
army in Europe. </p><p>Michener received a&nbsp;commission in
the&nbsp;navy in 1943. He first performed clerical duties with the
Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C, and was then transferred to
the Aviation Supply Depot in Philadelphia. From 1944 to 1946&nbsp;he
served as a naval historian in the South Pacific and traveled widely in
the area. His early fiction is also based on his experiences in the
Pacific.&nbsp; Michener sailed on the <em>Cape Victory</em>, a transport ship, for a year and a half. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"From far away, from deep in the jungles
near Jap sentries, came a human voice. It was clear, quiet, somewhat
high-pitched. But it never rose to excitement. I was to hear that voice
often, almost every day for two months. Like hundreds of Americans who
went forth to fight aided by that voice, I can hear it now. It fills
the room about me as it filled that sweating hut. It was always the
same. Even on the last day it was free from nervousness. On this
morning it said: "Good morning, Americans! This is your Remittance Man.
I am speaking from the Upper Solomons. First the weather. There are
rain clouds over Bougainville, the Treasuries, Choiseul, and New
Georgia. I believe it will rain in this region from about 0900 to 1400.
The afternoon will be clear. It is now 94 degrees. There are no
indications of violent weather."</b></font><b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from 'The Cave' in </font><i><font size="2">Tales of the South Pacific</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>After the war, Michener worked as&nbsp;an&nbsp;associate editor at
the Macmillan Company in New York until 1949,&nbsp;and
then&nbsp;devoted himself entirely to writing. In 1948 he won the
Pulitzer Prize for the collection<i> Tales of the South Pacific</i>.
Alice Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt,
had recommended the book to the award committee. Critics classified the
work as a series of short fiction, although the author himself
considered it a novel because of the unified setting and the recurrence
of several characters throughout the book. </p><p>The stories depict
Navy officers and enlisted men, Marines, Seabees, and nurses as well as
the inhabitants of the islands during the war. The book received the
Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was the basis for the famous Richard
Rodgers-Oscar Hammerstein musical, with songs like 'I'm Gonna Wash That
Man Right Out of My Hair,' 'Younger Than Spring Time,' and 'Bali Ha'i.'
Joshua Logan, who had brought the show to the stage in 1949, directed
its film version, lasting two hours and 51 minutes, with a 15-minute
intermission. Although the public loved the movie, Time found it "about
as tastelessly impressive as a ten-ton marshmallow". Leon Shamroy, the
director of photography, used color gels to establish "mood" for each
use of song and defended the idea in an interview: "My interpretation
of the South Pacific was like Gauguin painted it. I also wanted to
create a change of pace... So I shot the musical parts as a fantasy by
sliding colored gelatin filters across the lens." </p>
<p>John Ford's film<i> Donovan's Reef</i> (1963) was loosely based on
Michener's 'The South Sea Story' although the writer was not credited.
It was lushly filmed in Technicolor on the Hawaiian island Kauai. John
Wayne was Michael Patrick "Guns" Donovan who has no intention of
returning home to America after World War II. With his sparring
partner, Thomas Aloysius "Boats" Gilhooney, he has found a happier
existence among the islanders of French Polynesia. James Edward Grant,
who wrote the screenplay with James Nugent, once said: "All you gotta
have in a John Wayne picture is a hoity-toity dame with big tits that
Duke can throw over his knee and spank, and a collection of jerks he
can smash in the face every five minutes." The arrival of Amelia
(Elizabeth Allen), and the romantic relationship between her and
Donovan, complicates for a short time the situation but she soon
becomes part of the island's free way of life. </p>
<p>The following novel, <em>The Fires of Spring</em> was a
semi-autobiographical&nbsp;story about a poor, creative artist trying
to establish himself as a writer in New York. Because Macmillan had
refused the book, Michener&nbsp;took&nbsp;the manuscript to Random
House, his major publisher since 1949. <em>Return to Paradise </em>(1950) brought together essays and fictional stories about the Pacific islands. It was followed by <em>The Bridges at Toko-Ri</em> (1953), a story set against the Korean War and depicting a self-sacrificing jet pilot. In <em>Sayonara</em>
(1954) Michener returned to the world of Madame Butterfly and depicted
the ill-fated romance of an American officer and a Japanese woman.
Shortly after the novel's publication Michener married his third wife,
Mari Yoriko Sabusawa, an American of Japanese extraction. </p><p>In the film adaptation of <em>Sayonara </em>Marlon
Brando (Major Gruver) falls in love with a beautiful dancer and faces
his own prejudices. Paul Osborn, who wrote the screenplay, was rewarded
with an Oscar. <em>Hawaii</em> (1959) was a blockbuster novel and also
its screen version, directed by George Roy Hill, became very popular.
Hawaiian location filming was principally made at Makua Beach on the
Island of Oahu. During the filming Julie Andrew's dress actually caught
fire and one Friday Hill was removed from the picture. When a number of
Hawaiian extras announced they would strike, Hill was reinstated the
next Monday. </p>
<p>In 1949 Michener had moved to Hawaii, and completed there his long
historical novel, which combined history and fiction. The story started
with the geological beginnings of the islands to the migrations of the
Polynesians and the arrival of the Europeans. Using the same formula
Michener produced several large novels, including <em>Caravans </em>(1963), <em>Source</em> (1965), inspired by the author's travel to Israel, <em>Centennial</em> (1974),&nbsp;<em>Poland</em> (1983),&nbsp;<em>Texas</em> (1985),&nbsp;<em>Alaska</em> (1988) and&nbsp;<em>Mexico</em> (1992). He also wrote non-fiction, and among other books <em>Kent State</em>
(1971), a study of the events in 1970 that led to the killing of four
students by the Ohio National Guard during a Vietnam War protest.&nbsp;<em>Legacy</em> (1987) was a short essay-like novel that criticized the United States' tendency to criticize the world, and&nbsp;<em>The Novel</em>&nbsp;(1991) was a story of the settlement of Pennsylvania by the Dutch. </p>
<p>Michener ran unsuccessfully in 1962 on the Democratic ticket for the
U.S. House of Representatives. He was a member of the advisory
committee on the arts for the U.S. Department of State in 1957, served
as a secretary of Pennsylvania's Constitutional Convention in 1967-68,
and was member of the Advisory Committee, United States Information
Agency (1970-76), Council of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (1980-83). From 1983 he was member of the Board of
International Broadcasting. Michener received more than 20 honorary
degrees, and was awarded both the Navy Gold Cross and National Medal of
Freedom. </p>
<p>During his career as a writer Michener wrote some 40 books, which
sold about 75 million copies. Many of his works have also been adapted
for film and television. Michener continued to publish prolifically,
though he had a severe heart attack in his fiftees, a hip replacement
in his seventies, and&nbsp;in his eighties he had to take kidney
dialysis treatments. While writing <em>Alaska </em>he lived in a log
cabin near to Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, Alaska. A very private
man, he guarded his personal life, but in 1992 at the age of
eighty-five, Michener published his autobiography, <em>The World&nbsp;Is My Home</em>.&nbsp;Michener
died after his decision to stop the treatment for renal
disease.&nbsp;He was married three times: first to Patti Koon in 1935
(divorced in 1948), the second time to Vange Nord in 1948 (divorced in
1955), and the third time&nbsp;to Mari Yoriko Sabusawa in 1955.
Michener's collection of twentieth-century American art has been
donated to the University of Texas at Austin. </p>

by Eduard Douwes Dekker, I was astounded by the freedom with which he
incorporated in his novel material of the most revolutionary character:
price lists, data on the cultivation of sugarcane, long disquisitions
on life in Indonesia and political analyses." (on </font><a href="flaubert.htm"><font size="2">Flaubert</font></a><font size="2">)
"Curiously, I never studied the way in which a gifted novelist like
Flaubert can gather together a group of characters within a limited
compass and give the entire novel a sense of the universal."</font><font size="2"> (on </font><a href="nmailer.htm"><font size="2">Norman Mailer</font></a><font size="2">) "I used to think that the Norman Mailer of </font><i><font size="2">The Naked and the Dead</font></i><font size="2">,
published when he was twenty-five, was merely a sensationally
successful one-book author, and his first books thereafter seemed to
prove that. But he revealed himself as a protean man with the widest
possible interest and the skill to tackle them all, from pertinent
comments on politics to a biography of Marilyn Monroe... He has been
invaluable to American life because he is an authentic American voice."</font><font size="2"> (on </font><a href="vidal.htm"><font size="2">Gore Vidal</font></a><font size="2">) "Gore Vidal, who wrote </font><i><font size="2">Williwaw</font></i><font size="2">

matter from the critical days of early Christianity to the dramatic
eras of American history to outrageous sexual games. I envy him two
novels on whose subjects I also did a great deal of work: </font><i><font size="2">Julian</font></i><font size="2">, which deals with the apostate who tried to turn back Christianity in ancient Antiochea, and </font><i><font size="2">1876</font></i><font size="2">,

the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes stole the presidential election from
the Democrat Samuel J.Tilden." </font><b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"></font></p>
