<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->English novelist, short story writer, and poet, who is best known for his book<span style="font-style: italic;"> Under the Volcano</span> (1947), a 20th century
classic. Like many of Lowry's publications, the novel is highly autobiographical. An alcoholic, Lowry spent his post-<i>Volcano</i>
years drinking and planning a cycle of novels built around his
masterwork. He lived from 1940 to 1954 in a primitive cabin in
Dollarton, British Columbia, and then in Italy and England until his
death. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>I wrote: in the dark cavern of our birth. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">The printer had it tavern, which seems better: </font><br>
<font size="2">But herein lies the subject of our mirth, </font><br>
<font size="2">Since on the next page death appears and dearth. </font><br>

<font size="2">('Strange Type', from </font><i><font size="2">Selected Poems of Malcolm Lowry</font></i><font size="2">, 1962)</font></blockquote>


<p>Malcolm Lowry was born in Birkenhead, Chesire, England, the son of
Arthur Lowry, a wealthy cotton broker, who owned plantations in Egypt,
Peru, and Texas. His grandfather from his mother's side was a Norwegian
sea captain. At the age of sevent, Lowry went almost blind from a
disorder of the corneas, but recovered his sight four years later after
an operation. </p>
<p>Like his three brothers, Lowry attended public boarding schools. He
was educated at Caldicote School, Hertfordshire, and at the Leys
school, Cambridge. At the age of fifteen, he won a championship in golf
in junior series. Rebelling against his bourgeois upbringing, Lowry
interrupted his academic studies, and run away to sea to work as a
deckhand on a freighter bound for China and on a ship sailing to Oslo.
One of Lowry's affairs in Norway was to meet the writer <a href="ngrieg.htm">Nordahl Grieg</a>.
Later he continued his studies at the University of Cambridge, where he
gained fame as a promising young writer. Lowry obtained a first-class
degree in English. </p>
<p>Lowry's first novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Ultramarine</span> (1933) drew material from  his voyage to Yokohama  
on the S.S. Pyrrhus.  It was accepted for publication in 1932, but after the original typescrift was stolen Lowry rewrote 
the work from the penultimate version. 

The story of a mess-boy on the freighter Oedipus Tyrannus bound for Bombay 
and Singapore received a mixed critics. <i>Ultramarine</i> was inspired by Grieg's novel <i>The Ship Sails On</i> (1924), and also showed  
debt to<i> Blue Voyage</i> by his friend <a href="caiken.htm">Conrad Aiken</a>, in whose autobiography <i>Ushant </i>(1952) he was 
to appear as Hambro.  </p>

<p>Lowry lived in London and then in Paris until 1935. He travelled to
Spain with Aiken and met there the American writer Jan Gabrial. They
married in 1934 and moved in 1935 to the United States. He spent some
time in the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital in New York City.
After writing the novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> Lunar Caustic</span>, publishded posthumously in 1958, he went  to Mexico,
which became the settings of <i>Under the Volcano</i>.
In Cuernavaca and the nearby volcanoes he found the perfect landscape
for his novel. The snowy peak of Popocatepetl was for him a symbol of
aspiration, and the deep woods in the surroundings formed the opposite,
lower depths. </p>
<p>In Oaxaca Lowry was thrown into a jail <font face="Symbol">- </font>he
was considered a Spanish spy. Once he forgot the first draft of his
manuscript in a bar. By the time Lowry left Mexico, his first marriage
was in ruins. Later, in her book <i>Inside the Volcano</i> (2000), Jan
Gabrial wrote that "He would drink anything. I had thrown out the
rubbing alcohol I'd used to massage his back, but he gulped the
contents of a bottle he thought contained hair tonic but which Josefina
had refilled with cooking oil..." His second wife, the novelist
Margerie Bonner, Lowry met in Los Angeles. He moved in 1939 to
Dollarton, British Columbia, where he built for himself and for his
wife a squatters shack to live. The hut burned down in 1944, but
Margerie Bonner managed to save his manuscript from the fire.</p>
<p>After a short visit to Mexico in 1945, the Lowrys returned to Canada, where they stayed until 1954, 
then moving to England. During his last years Lowry planned a modern, "drunken<i> Divine Comedy,</i>" a sequence of seven novels built around <i>Under the Volcano</i>, titled <i>The Voyage That 
Never Ends</i>. He had already written the "Purgatory" part, "Paradise" had been 
destroyed in the fire. Simultaneously Lowry worked on a number of manuscripts, unable to bring his 
plans to completion. <i>Under the Volcano </i>was for a short time on a best-seller list in the 
United States, but according to the author,  the book sold in Canada only two copies. 
In France is was a critical success and hailed immediately as a classic. Efforts 
to adapt the book into a film had failed in the United States, but when Lowry's 
German publisher began to negotiate about a movie version, perhaps Peter 
Lorre playing the role of the Consul, the author said that 
he "would rather have it produced in Germany than in any country in the world." 
He had a real regard for Lorre's art&#8211;"there couldn't be a better part for him than the Consul".  Lowry also 
offered his help in the script development. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Neurosis, of one kind and another, is
stamped on almost every word he writes, both neurosis and a kind of
fierce health. Perhaps his tragedy is that he is the only normal writer
left on earth and it is this that adds to his isolation and so to his
sense of guilt."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Hear Us O Lord heaven thy dwelling place</font></i><font size="2">, 1962) </font></blockquote>
<p>By 1940 Lowry had written an early, unpublishable edition of <i>Under the Volcano</i>.
He had sent it to his agent Harold Matson, but after twelve publishers
had rejected the manuscript Matson returned it. The next five years he
spent rewriting and deepening the magical and mythical elements,
especially after meeting a Cabbalist, Charles Stansfield-Jones,
spiritual son of <a href="crowley.htm">Alesteir Crowley</a>. The novel
went through innumerable revisions, many with Margerie Lowry's help,
and was eventually published by Jonathan Cape ten years after the
author started to work on it. </p>
<p>The story is set in Quauhnahuac, Mexico. It depicts the last twelve
hours on November 2, 1938, in the life of Geoffrey Firmin, an
ex-British Consul in a Mexican city situated under two volcanoes.
Firmin is an alcoholic. He has rejected the love of his wife and
friends, and taken to drink as an escape from the inhumanity of the
modern world and his own sense of failure. Other central characters are
Jacques Laruelle, a failed filmmaker and adulterous lover, who looks
back on the dramatic events of the Day of the Dead, and Hugh, the
consul's half-brother, an anti-Fascist journalist, much preoccupied by
the Spanish Civil War. The novel<font face="Symbol"> -</font> partly written in stream of consciousness<font face="Symbol"> - </font>shows influence of <a href="jconrad.htm">Joseph Conrad</a> and <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>. Despite the gloomy subject matter, the book is written in a lyrical style and is full of humour. </p>

<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid</font></i><font size="2">, 1968) </font></blockquote>

<p>Lowry's alcoholism and mental disorders shadowed much of his writing career and starting a new novel was for him very 
difficult. The last ten years of his life he spent in and out of hospitals. Accidents followed him everywhere, broken bones, 
dog bites, blood poisoning. Lowry died of an overdose of sleeping tablets in a boarding house in Ripe, Sussex, England, on June 
27, 1957. He was buried in the graveyard of the village church. A number of Lowry's works has been published posthumously. 
In the unfinished novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid </span>(1968) the protagonist, Sigbjørn Wilderness, 
is Lowry's alter ego <font face="Symbol">- </font>a
writer unable to write, but whose voyage of self-destruction ends
against all odds with a possible happy ending. Lowry finished the
"first of the first draft" of the novel in 1947, resumed the work in
Canada in 1951. He thought the novel as part of a trilogy. The
collected edition of Lowry's poetry was published in 1992. His poems
were highly autobiographical and record his personal problems, probing
such themes as desperation and guilt. </p>

<font size="2">Late of the Bowery </font><br>
<font size="2">His prose was flowery </font><br>
