<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->One of the greatest German lyric poets melding
classical and Christian themes in his works. Among Hölderlin's major works is the novel <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Hyperion oder Der Eremit in Griechenland</em> </span></span>(1797-99),
in which he expressed his longing for ancient Greece. His actual career
as a writer lasted only about a decade. Hölderlin's life was never
settled or happy: he lacked both money and recognition and his socially
suspect love affair with a married woman finally drove him insane. Once
he wrote: "I am mortal, born to love and to suffer."<font size="2"><b> </b></font>He rejected the commonly accepted ideal of happiness, for him pleasure was but "tepid water on the tongue". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Nur einen Sommer gönnt, ihr Gewaltigen! /
Und einen Herbst zu reifem Gesange mir, / Dass williger mein Herz, vom
süssen / Spiele gesättiget, dann mir sterbe. </b>(from 'An die Parzen') </font></blockquote>

<p>Friedrich Hölderin was born in Lauffen am Neckar, Württemberg. He
was the first son of Heinrich Friedrich Hölderlin and Johanna
Christiana Heyn. His father, who worked as an executive at the local
monastery, died of a brain stroke in 1772. A few years later his mother
married Johann Christian Gock. a wine merchant, who became the mayor of
Nürtingen.&nbsp; With his stepfather, Hölderlin formed&nbsp; a warm
relationship, referring to his as his "second father". He died in 1779,
after contracting pneumonia. <br>
</p>
      <p>At the age of 14 Hölderlin already had started to write poems,
which were read by his friends from school and teachers. In 1788 he
entered the university of Tübingen, where he studied theology and
obtained a master's degree. Financially he was still supported by his
mother, who never relinquished her control over his inheritance. During
this period he became friends with Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel (1770-1831)
and shared with him a great admiration of the French Revolution. Under
the oppressive regime in Württenberg, Hölderlin expressed his
opposition more or less in abstract tems but basically poetry served as
a vehicle of revolt: "And if the rabble, a thousand strong, droned
their warnings and tried / To throttle us with their thousand tongues
of priestly rage / Banning all that's new, we'd laugh them off the
stage / We sons of the dsaughter of god, Justice." After knocking the
hat off a schoolteacher's head because the teacher refused to greet him
properly in the street, Hölderlin is sentenced to six hours in the
university prison. <br>
 </p>

<p>Hölderlin was introduced in 1793 to <a href="schiller.htm">Friedrich 
von Schiller</a>,
who published some of his poems, such as 'The Oaks'. Later Hölderlin
copied the published version of this poem in a notebook and began to
rework its ending. "The poet has a clear view of nature, but he only
seems to have come to it through tradition," said Goethe of Hölderlin's
early pieces. In 1793 Hölderlin worked as a private tutor in
Waltershausen, but the turning point in his life was, when he took post
in a house of a wealthy Frankfurt banker Jakob Gontard on the estate
White Hart. Hölderlin had a painful but platonic love
affair with his employee's wife Susette Gontard, whom he called
'Diotima' in his poems. He had been working on <i>Hyperion</i>
before first meeting Susette. "Forgive me that Diotima dies," he said.
Their happiness was short-lived and ended by the husband. However, the
were in correspondence and met secretly; the last time they saw each
other was 1800. Susette's letters to the poet have survived.
Hölderlin's longing for the lost world of the Greeks, his second
fatherland (the "holy heart of the peoples") parallels with his love
for Susette; both are unattainable. Germany was for him a fragmented
homeland: "Craftsmen you see, but no humans, thinkers, but no humans,
priests, but no humans, lords and servants, boys and established people
but no humans &#8211; is this not like a battle field, where hands and arms
and all limbs lie chaotically in pieces, while the spilled blood if
life runs into the sand?" <font size="-1">(from <span style="font-style: italic;">Hyperion</span>)&nbsp;</font> <em></em> </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The greatest lyric poets, for instance
Hölderlin or Keats, are men in whom the mythic power of insight breaks
forth again in its full intensity and objectifying power..."</b> (Ernst Cassirer in <i>Language and Myth</i>, 1946)</font></blockquote>
<p>Hölderlin left Frankfurt in 1798; he was fired from his job at White
Hart. He settled at the nearby town of Bad Homburg, where his friend
Isaak von Sinclair, a politically engaged Jacobin resided. Separated
from Susette and having a lot of free time for his art, he went through
a period of intense creativity, producing his great elegies,philosophical texts, and the second volume of <span style="font-style: italic;"> Hyperion</span>. He also began to write a tragedy, <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Der Tod des Empedokles</em></span></span>, which was left unfinished. When he visited his friends in Stuttgart, they were struck by his evident ill health. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the conclusion to his great hymn 'Patmos,' the poet named
the "cultivation of the firm letter and the interpretation of what is"
as the proper office of poetry. Shortly before his departure for
France, Hölderlin said: " Now I can rejoice over a new truth, a better
view of what is above us and around us, though I fear that things may
eventually go with me as for ancient Tantalus, who received more from
the gods than he could digest." <br>
      </p>
      <p>After working for a short time as a tutor at Bordeaux,
Hölderin returned in 1802 to Germany, walking the disastrous journey in
an advanced stage of schizophrenia. Back in Stuttgart he received the
news that Susette had died. Disheveled and disoriented, Hölderlin
returned to his mother's house in Nürtingen, where he took many long
walks alone. Hölderlin returned with Sinclair to Bad Homburg in 1804.
The next year his mental health collapsed totally; Sinclair complained
that he was playing the piano "night an day." During the periods, when
regained sanity enough to write, he translated among others Sophocles's
tragedies. In the Autenrieth Clinic he was forced to wear a face mask
designed to keep patients silent. <br>
 </p>

<p>The last 36 years of his life Hölderin spent under the shadow of
insanity, living his last years in a carpenter's house in Tübingen. His
pricipal occupation was music though he continued to write verses.
Hölderlin died on June 7, 1843. Among Hölderlin's finest lyrics are
'Brod und Wein,' an elegy celebrating both Jesus and Dionysus, 'Der
Archipelagus', an ode in which it is hoped that modern Germany will
tend toward the character of ancient Greece, 'Heidelberg' and 'Der
Rhein,' odes on the city and the river, and the patriotic ode
'Germanien'. In 1861 Friedrich Nietzsche, who died insane, wrote an
enthusiastic essay on his "favorite poet," Hölderlin, mostly forgotten
at that time.&nbsp;A collection of Hölderlin's works,&nbsp;<em>Ausgewählte Werke</em>,
came out in 1874, but it was not until the early 20th century, when he
started to gain recognition as Germany's greatest poet after Goethe. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">MENSCHENBEIFALL </font><br>
<font size="2"><b>Ist nicht heilig mein Herz, schöneren Lebens voll, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">seit ich liebe? warum achtetet ihr mich mehr, </font><br>
<font size="2">da ich stolzer und wilder, </font><br>
<font size="2">wortereicher und leerer war? </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Ach! der Menge gefällt, was auf den Marktplatz taugt, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">und es ehret der Knecht nur den Gewaltsamen; </font><br>
<font size="2">an das Göttliche glauben </font><br>
<font size="2">die allein, die es selber sind. </font></b></blockquote>


<p>Hölderlin was not directly affiliated with either of the two major
literary movements of his time, Weimar Classicism or Romanticism, but
his thought has elements in common with both. A central image in his
poems is the night &#8211; it is the time when creation is done, the natural
elements of the gods, and the symbol of transformation: "But the night
comes! let us hurry to observe the autumn feast / Yet today! full is
the heart, but life is short." In his use of classical
verse forms and syntax, Hölderlin was follower of Friedrich Klopstock
(1724-1803), who attempted to develop for the German language a
classical perfection of its own that would place it on a par with Greek
and Latin. Hölderlin shared the classicists' love of "edlen Einfalt und
stillen Grösse" (noble simplicity and calm greatness), formulated by
Johann Winckelmann (1717-1768), and added to it his mystical sense of
nature with elements of pantheism and Christian images. Like <a href="wblake.htm">William Blake</a> and <a href="wbyeats.htm">W.B. Yeats</a>,
he explored cosmology and history to find a meaning in uncertain world.
Hölderlin also played an important role in the development of
philosophy from Kant to Hegel, and hence in the formation of German
Idealism. </p>
<p>The poetry of Hölderlin fascinated the German philosopher Martin
Heidegger (1889-1976) who wrote: "Poetry is the establishment of Being
by means of the word." Heidegger's essays on Hölderlin (1936) are
translated in <i>Existence and Being</i> by W. Brock (1949). Although
Nietzsche had been interested in Hölderlin, it was not until the
post-World War I decades in Germany, when his work received wide
attention, partly due to the enthusiasm of Norbert von Hellingrath. In
his lectures in the 1930s Heidegger regarded Hölderlin as a poet the
national awakening, a prophet of the future Being [<i>Seyn</i>] of a nation. Ironically, Hölderlin's hero in <i>Hyperion</i>
sees his ideals collapse and he is forced to leave his home country
because of its despotic rule. "Poets have mostly arisen at the
beginning or at the end of a world period," Hölderlin himself once
said.&nbsp;Though he was widely celebrated in the Third Reich in 1943
and his collected works were published in four volumes, new
translations of his poems were published also in London and in the
United States. </p>
