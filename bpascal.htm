<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Mathematician, physicist, and theologian,
inventor of the first digital calculator, who is often thought of as
the ideal of classic French prose. Pascal lived in the time when
Copernicus' discovery &#8211; that the earth moves round the sun &#8211; had made
fallen human beings insignificant factors in the new order of the
world. Facing the immensity of the universe, Pascal felt horror &#8211; "The
eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me." For him the
world seemed empty of ultimate meaning or significance without
Christianity, which he defended against the assaults of freethinkers.
While Montaigne lived at ease with skepticism, Pascal was tormented by
religious doubt, and took the question <i>Why are we here?</i> with the utmost seriousness, revealing his thoughts in his most famous book, the posthumous<span style="font-style: italic;"> Pensées</span>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Pascal's disillusioned analysis of human
bondage is sometimes interpreted to mean that Pascal was really and
finally an unbeliever, who, in his despair, was incapable of enduring
reality and enjoying the heroic satisfaction of the free man's worship
of nothing. His despair, his disillusion, are, however, no illustration
of personal weakness; they are perfectly objective, because they are
essential moments in the progress of the intellectual soul; and for the
type of Pascal they are the analogue of the drought, the dark night,
which is an essential stage in the progress of the Christian mystic." </b>(T.S. Eliot in </font><i><font size="2">Selected Essays</font></i><font size="2">, 1960) </font></blockquote>
<p>Blaise Pascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand, Auvergne (now
Clermont-Ferrand), a town on the slope of Puy de Dôme, an extinct
volcanic peak. A sickly, precocious child, he grew up without the
company of other children. His mother Pascal had lost at an early age.
He studied privately, tutored mostly by his father, Etienne, who was a
scientist and a government official. By age 12 he had worked out <a href="pythagor">Pythagoras</a>'
theorem by himself. At thirteen Pascal was introduced to a discussion
group, called the Académie Mersenne after the black-robed friar. This
scientific circle included the philosopher-mathematician <a href="descarte.htm">René Descartes</a>
and the amateur mathematic genius Pierre de Fermat. For a time Pascal's
father was disgraced for complicity in a bond-holders' protest, but he
was rehabilitated with the help of Richelieu's niece. In 1631 the
family moved to Paris and in 1640 then to Rouen. When his father died,
he was able to leave a sufficient patrimony to his son and his two
daughters. </p>
<p>From an early age Pascal showed an inclination toward mathematics. He wrote at the age of 16 a highly 
appreciated treatise <span style="font-style: italic;">Essay pour les Coniques</span>.
Together with Fermat, Pascal invented the calculus of probabilities and
laid the foundations for Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz's infinitesimal
calculus. Pascal also designed a calculating machine &#8211; becoming one of
the fathers of the Computer Age &#8211; and later the barometer, the
hydraulic press, and the syringe. In Clermont Pascal demostrated how
the weight of the Earth's atmosphere balanced the mercury in the
barometer. </p>
<p>Pascal suffered on an off with stomach pains, headaches, bouts of
sweating, and partial paralysis in his legs. His treatment included
bleedings, purgings, and the consumption of asses' milk. In 1646
Parcal's father dislocated his hip, and two Jansenist brothers, Adrien
and Jean Deschamps, came to his aid. By the end of the year the entire
Pascal family had converted to Jansenism, the Catholic sect rivaling
the Jesuits who had the support of the King, Louis XIV. Pascal's
sister, Jaqueline, entered the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal in
south-west Paris and became one of the most passionate advocates of the
sect. The Jansenists, who were never officially accepted by the
Catholic Church, were named after Cornelius Jansenius (1587-1638), a
Flemish theologian. The Jansenists argued that since the Fall in the
Garden of Eden, all humankind has been corrupted by sin. Their
objection to the Jesuits stemmed from what they saw as the
over-reliance of the Jesuits on human free will, to the detriment of
divine grace. Jansenius, in his book <i>Augustinus</i>, stated that
the salvation of the individual man must be achieved by a combination
of his own effort and the free-will to exercise his natural ability
together with supernatural grace. </p>
<p>On his father's second retirement, Pascal returned in 1647 to Paris,
where his physical condition improved. He was adviced by a doctor to
give up all continued mental labor, and seek as much as possible all
opportunities to divet himself. Until 1654 Pascal devoted himself to
mathematics and scientific studies, but he also spent time in the
company of young men of leisure. His sister Gilberte called his wordly
period "the time of his life that was worst employed." One of Pascal's
partying friends introduced him to chevalier de Méré, an expert
gambler, who brought him the so-called problem of points. Pascal solved
the puzzle with Fermat. At the heart of their computational method was
a triangle array called Pascal's triangle, actually discovered by a
Chinese mathematician, Jia Xian, around 1050, published by Zhu Shijie,
in 1303, and discussed in a work by the Italian Renaissance
mathematician Gerolamo Cardano. </p>

<font size="2">(Every number in the triangle is the sum of the two above it.</font><font size="2">)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>After a mystical experience on November 23-24, 1654, he had a second
conversion, and dropped most of his friends. He sold everything except
his Bible, began to wear an iron belt with points on the inside, and
denounced his studies of mathematics and science. Pascal defended
Jansenism against the Jesuits in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Lettres provinciales</span> (Provincial Letters). The work progresses from 
parody to provocative formulations. In France the dichotomy between Jesuits and Jansenists come to mean the moral 
divide between opportunism and blunt integrity. </p>

<p>After his horses plunged off a bridge to their deaths in 1654,
Pascal renewed his spiritual direction and made occasional retreats to
the Jansenist community at Port-Royal des Champs. In 1659 Pascal fell
gravely ill. His last years he devoted himself to charitable projects.
From 1660 to 1662 Pascal worked on a public transportation system for
Paris. It concisted of horse-drawn carriages, "Five-Penny Coaches",
scheduled to run along regular routes. Pascal died in Paris on August
19, 1662, as a result of what is believed to have been a painful
stomach ulcer. Pascal's autopsy revealed a severe lesion in his brain.
Memorial, his document of faith, was found sewn in his clothing on his
death. He had apparently carried the sheets with him for the last eight
years of his life. </p>
<p>Pascal examined the problems of human existence from both psychological and theological points of view. 
"The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of," he once wrote. Against the immensity of 
the universe he measured the fate of human beings &#8211; "Man is but a reed, the weakest thing in nature; but 
he is a thinking reed." For Jansenists his work came at the right time: they needed an outsider to defend their 
cause. The <i>Letters</i>,
written with freshness and spontaneity, was ideal for that purpose.
According to the famous "Pascal´s wager", sane and prudent persons must
bet their lives on Roman Catholicism. If they do, and it turns out to
be true, then they have won an eternity of bliss. And if it turns out
to be false, and death is after all annihilation, what has been lost?
Due to its greater expected value, religious belief is more rational.
But of course there is a weakness in this beautiful reasoning &#8211; Roman
Catholicism is not the only religion; there is an actual infinity of
other possible universal truths. </p>
<p>Experimenting with the vacuum, Pascal published in 1663 his study <span style="font-style: italic;">Traité de la pesanteur de la masse de l'air</span>,
where he argued that "experiments are the true teachers which one must
follow in physics." This principle of empiricism put Pascal into
conflict with Descartes, whose starting point was human reason. "Those
who are accustomed to judge by feeling," Pascal said, "do not
understand the process of reasoning, for they would understand at first
sight and are not used to seek for principles. And others, on the
contrary, who are accustomed to reason from principles, do not at all
understand matters of feeling, seeking principles and being unable to
see at a glance." But Pascal's belief in God was based on personal
religious experience &#8211; he saw that reason cannot decide the question of
God's existence, but he could appeal to it. In <i>Pensées</i> Pascal
wrote: "Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be
true. The cure for this is first to show that religion is not contrary
to reason, but worthy of reverence and respect. Next make it
attractive, make good men wish it were true, and then show that it is."
</p>
<p>Pascal´s studies deeply influenced the development of modern essay writing. The idea of intuition as presented in 
<i>Pensées</i> had an impact on the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), 
and Henri Bergson (1859-1941). Also the popularity of <i>Provincial Letters</i>
has remained undiminished. Pascal was among the first noteworthy
philosophers who seriously questioned the existence of God. When he
imagined himself arguing with somebody who was constitutionally unable
to believe, Pascal could find no arguments to convince him. He
concluded that belief in God could only be a matter of personal choice.
This basically revolutionary approach to the problem of God's existence
&#8211; it became a matter of betting &#8211; has never been officially accepted by
any church. Samuel Butler wrote later in his notebook: "What is faith
but a kind of betting or speculation after all? It should be: 'I bet my
Redeemer liveth.'" </p>
