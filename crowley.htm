<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English writer and occult
figure, popularly known as "the Great Beast" or by the media "The
Wickedest Man in the World", because of his fascination to sex magic
and degradation, drug-taking and hedonism. Crowley's famous motto was
"Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law". In 1934 Crowley took
objection to remarks about him and brought a suit for defamation of
character, which he lost. The presiding judge stated in his summation:
"I have learned in this case that we can always learn something more if
we live long enough I have never heard of such dreadful, horrible,
blasphemous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the
man who describes himself to you as the greatest living poet." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"... Worship me with fire and blood; worship me with swords and with spears..."</b> (from <i>The Book of the Law</i> by Aleister Crowley, 1938) </font></blockquote>
<p>Aleister Crowley was born Edward Alexander Crowley in Leamington,
Warwickshire. In his autobiography Crowley claimed he was "remarkable
from the moment of his birth. He bore on his body the three most
important distinguishing marks of a Buddha. He was tongue-tied, and on
the second day of his incarnation a surgeon cut the fraenum linguae. He
had also the characteristic membrane, which necessitated an operation
for phimosis three lustres later. Lastly, he had upon the centre of his
heart four hairs curling from left to right in the exact form of a
Swastika." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Confessions of Aleister Crowley</font></i><font size="2">, 1929-30) </font></p>
<p>Crowley's parents belonged to a strict Puritan sect known as the
'Plymouth' Brethren of 'Closed'. "Crowley's problem, of course, was
that he was born in the midst of the Victorian age, into a family of
Plymouth Brothers who regarded sex as horribly sinful," Colin Wilson
wrote later. "He spent the rest of his life violently reacting against
this view, and preaching &#8211; and practicing &#8211; the gospel of total sexual
freedom." The Protestant group had its origin in Ireland. They regarded
Christmas as a pagan rite, believed that the Pope is Anti-Christ, and
that the rituals of the Church of England are essentially hellish in
nature. After his father died Crowley abandoned all aspects of
Christianity and considered his mother a 'religious bigot'. On the
other hand, she called him 'The Beast' known from the <i>Apocalypse of St John</i>,
the last book of the New Testament. Crowley partially accepted the
identification and claimed that his advent had been prophesied in the <i>Apocalypse</i>. The avoid sharing the same first name with his father, Crowley changed Edward to Aleister. </p>
<p>His first cat Crowley killed at the age of 11, and much later
rumours linked him with infanticide and cannibalism. But above all,
Crowley discovered the pleasures of sex, which horrified his mother and
uncle. In 1892 he went to public school in Malvern, had homosexual
experiences, and transferred to Tonbridge, where he caught gonorrhea.
Inheriting his father's brewing fortune, Crowley studied at Trinity
College at Cambridge, devoting his time to poetry and occultism. </p><p>Crowley&nbsp;joined in 1898 The Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn, which had also poet <a href="wbyeats.htm">W.B. Yeats</a>
as its member. Other illustrious names included Algernon Blackwood, the
creator of the occult detective John Silence, and Arthur Machen. Its
ceremonies were strongly influenced by cabalism and spiritualism.
During the next few years Crowley became a member of the group's inner
conclave, but after quarrels of the control of the group, he was
expelled from it. He founded his own less prominent order, the A A or
Argentium Astrum. The Golden Dawn, which was a white magical order,
became divided and never regained its formed popularity. Crowley
accused later that Yeats had used black magic against him, but he
managed to defeat the spell. There was one side effect &#8211; Crowley lost
his mistress Althea Gyles to Leonard Smithers, a publisher, who was
specialized in pornography. </p>

<font size="2">(from 'G-R-R-R-R-R!', 1916) </font></blockquote>
<p>Crowley claimed to have experienced in 1904 a vision in Egypt,
prophesying a new era for humanity. Next year he joined a group trying
to climb Kangchenjunga (Himalaya), but the attempt ended disastrously.
Crowley also visited Canada and America. During these travels his
daughter died of typhus in Rangoon. Energetically he established 'black
magic temples' in Italy and England, and wrote numerous books.
Crowley's early works include many volumes of poetry and books with
mythological or mystical themes, among them <i>Songs of the Spirit</i> (1898), <i>Aceldama</i> (1989), <i>The Soul of Osiris</i> (1901), <i>Tannhäuser</i> (1902), <i>The God-Eater</i> (1903), <i>Oracles</i> (1905). </p><p>Crowley&nbsp;married
in 1903 Rose Kelly, his first wife, but had still a ring of mistresses.
After divorcing in 1909 from Rose, who suffered from alcoholism, he
started a relationship with the poet Victor Neuberg. In 1912 he joined
the Ordo Templi Orientis&nbsp;&#8211; the Order of Eastern Templars, usually
referred as O.T.O. First he had been contacted by its German leader,
who believed that he had revealed its secret sex rituals. Crowley
served as the head of its British section, and took the name Baphomet,
an anti-Christian deity. In 1913 he began his first serious experiments
in sexual magic, which arose his interest in the use of homosexual acts
as magical methods. The sexual magic of the Ordo Templi Orientis was
introduced into North America by Crowley's disciple C.S. Jones. A
number of the members of O.T.O. have been Crowleyan.</p>
<p>From 1915 to 1919 Crowley lived in the United States, where he
published anti-British propaganda. A new woman in Crowley's life, Leah
Hirsig, bore him a child, Poupée; her death was a deep blow to him. It
has been claimed, that during these years Crowley served as a British
spy, gathering information on the German intelligence network and on
Irish Republican activity. In the 1920s Crowley moved to a hillside
villa in Sicily.&nbsp;He hoped the Cefalu villa 'Abbaye de Theleme',
would be a world centre for the study of the occult and sexual magic.
From Leah Hirsig he found an ideal partner and called her vagina as
"the Hirsig patent vacuum-pump". Once a he-goat was induced to copulate
with her. By his followers, he was consecrated a god in 1921. </p><p>Crowley&nbsp;mixed
blood and sex in rituals to obtain energy and achieve mystical insight.
Rumors were spread that one of his disciples, a 23-year-old Oxford
undergraduate Raoul Loveday,&nbsp;died from drinking the blood of a cat
in a Thelemic ritual. The cause of his death was actually&nbsp;enteric
fewer, contracted by drinking water from a stream. Nevertheless,
Crowley was expelled from Sicily by Mussolini or the Italian
authorities. The dead man's wife, Betty May, informed on Crowley's
degraded activities, and the English papers were full of stories of his
scandalous activities, ritual sacrifices etc. </p>
<p>In 1929 Crowley married his second wife, Maria Ferrari de Miramar,
and earned his living mostly by publishing obscure writings. The
following years were shadowed by poor health, drug addiction, and
desperation for money. He had a talisman, called Segelah, which was
intended "for finding a great treasure." Segelah was smeared with dried
semen and menstrual blood. When British printers refused to&nbsp;touch
his works, he had them produced in Paris, like many other writers such
as James Joyce. Soon&nbsp;Crowley was also deported from France. He had
started very early to experiment with psychedelic drugs to find a
substance which would "unlock the girders of the soul". During WWII, <a href="ifleming.htm">Ian Fleming</a>
suggested&nbsp;employing Crowley as an interrogator of the Nazi leader
Rudolf Hess, who landed unexpectedly in 1941 in Scotland and was
fascinated by the occult. </p>
<p>After expelling Wilfred Smith in 1942 from the Agape Lodge of Ordo
Templi Orientis (OTO), Crowley appointed Jack Parsons, a rocket
propulsion researcher, as its new head. Parsons's wife Helen Northrup
left with Smith, but Helen's half-sister Sarah Elizabeth Northrup (aka
'Betty'), a beautiful young blond, began a relationship with Parsons.
In the middle of the so-called Babalon Working, intended to sire a
Moonchild described in Crowley's book from 1929, Parsons chose to carry
out this sexual ritual with the read head occult artist Marjorie
Cameron; her magick partner was also L. Ron Hubbard, the future founder
of Scientology. The ritals went on for several days. With Sarah and
Hubbard, Parsons later in 1946 founded a boat dealing company named
Allied Enterprises. However, Hubbard defrauded him of his money, stole
his boat, and ran off with Sarah. </p>
<p>Crowley himself eventually ended in a boarding house in Hastings,
addicted to heroin and alcohol. His final act was to curse the doctor
who refused to give him more heroin. He died on December 1, 1947, and
was cremated in Brighton. Parts of the Mass of the 'Gnostic Catholic
Church' were read aloud at his funeral. (According to some rumors the
doctor died within twenty-four hours after the magician.) Crowley's
ashes were sent to followers in the United States. </p>
<p>As a writer Crowley was prolific. His novels, <i>The Diary of a Drug Friend</i> (1922) and <i>Moonchild</i>, were partly based on his personal life and egomaniac hallucinations. <i>Moonchild</i> was a <i>r</i><i>oman à clef</i>,
in which two societies of rival magicians quarrel over an experiment to
incarnate a supernatural being. H. Spencer Lewis, the founder of the
Rosicrucian organization known as AMORC, was portrayed as 'Butcher',
who wants to make money with magic. W.B. Yeats was 'Gates', a minor
poet with dirty fingernails. Among his most famous occult writings are <i>The Book of Lies</i> (1913), <i>Magick in Theory and Practice</i> (1929), and <i>The Book of the Law</i> (1938). In <i>The Book of Lies</i>,
a collection of poetic aphorisms and paradoxes, he wrote: "To beget is
to die; tie die is to beget. / Cast the Seed into the Field of Night. /
Life and Death are two names of A. Kill thyself." </p>
<p>After his death several unpublished writings have been released, including <i>The Confessions of Aleister Crowley</i>,
his autobiography, a self-portrait of the man, who also gained
reputation as a mountaineer. Most of all, he tried to achieve the
supremacy in the occult world, not only based on the knowledge of magic
(or 'magick' as he preferred to call it), but also in personal
revelations. "Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur
in Conformity with Will," Crowley wrote. The final 'k' in his unusual
spelling had a dual significance: it distinguished his system from
other varieties of occult magic and referred to the Greek word<i> kteis</i>&nbsp;&#8211; it had come to mean in the ancient times the female organs in their entirety &#8211; labia, clitoris, vagina and uterus. </p>
<p>Crucial was his vision in Egypt in 1904, when according to Crowley's
own account, his spiritual alter ego Aiwass or Aiwaz dictated the what
became known as <i>The Book of the Law</i>, actually a poem in three
short chapters. Eventually he believed that this being was his "Holy
Guardian Angel" and should be identified with the Christian Devil,
Satan. "... To worship me take wine and strange drugs... and be drunk
thereof! They shall not harm ye at all... Be strong, O man! Lust, enjoy
all things of sense ands rapture; fear not that God shall deny thee for
this."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Book of the Law</font></i><font size="2">)</font>
Crowley claimed that mankind has lived through two great aeons: that of
Isis, the prehistoric age of the dominance of Woman, and that of
Osiris, the age of the dominance of the male principle and of the great
religions. The present aeon was the commencement of that of Horus and
self-will. The third age would be a New Age of Youth, based on union of
female and male energies. Thus sex was central to Crowley's magical
practice, both in heterosexual and homosexual forms. </p>
<p>Crowley claimed to be reincarnation of the French occultist known as
Eliphas Lévi. One of Crowley's most notorious projects &#8211; a conjuration
of Pan employing his Oscar Wilde -style 'Hymn to Pan' &#8211; was lifted from
Edgar Jepson's thriller <i>No. 19 </i>(1910). According to Kenneth Grant, his magical theories correspond very closely with the schema of <a href="lovecraf.htm">H.P. Lovecraft</a>'s
Cthulhu mythos. Crowley's present day admirers see him as a white
magician, but Crowley himself was not so sure about it. In the 1920s he
wrote in his diary: "I may be a black magician but I'm bloody great
one." The writer Dennis Wheatley once told how Crowley was closed in a
private asylum outside Paris, but this story was not true. </p>
<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Eliphas Lévi </b></font><font size="-1">(1810-75,
original name Alphonse-Louis Constant) a Paris shoemaker's son,
expelled from the church for heresy, who worked as a journalist. Lévi
was a key figure in the occult revival of the 19th-century. He wrote
widely on Qabalah and Tarot. Among his works are <i>Dogma and Ritual of High Magic</i></font><font size="-1"> (1856) and <i>The History of Magic</i></font><font size="-1">. <b>"...
the Magus should not eat with those who he does not esteem, and must
live in the most uniform and methodical manner. He should have the most
exalted self-respect an should consider himself a dethroned sovereign,
who consents to existence that he may recover his crown. Being amiable
and well-behaved towards anyone, he should never permit himself to be
absorbed in social relations and should withdraw from circles where he
does not possess some initiative." </b></font><font size="-1">(from <i>The Mysteries of Magic</i> by Alphonse Constant, 1886) <b>- S</b><b>ee also</b></font><font size="-1">: <a href="ueco.htm">Umberto Eco</a></font><font size="-1"> and Foucault's Pendulum, <a href="acdoyle.htm">Arthur Conan Doyle</a></font><font size="-1">, whose interest in magic was far from the rational thinking of his best-known fictional character, Sherlock Holmes. <a href="maugham.htm">W. Somerset Maugham</a></font><font size="-1">'s novel <i>The Magician </i></font><font size="-1">depicts the lightly disguised character of Crowley. The author can also be found from James Blish's <i>Black Easter</i>, Dennis Wheatley's <i>The Devil Rides Out</i>, Colin Wilson's <i>Man Without a Shadow</i>, H.R. Wakefield's <i>He Cometh And He Passeth By</i>, and Dion Fortune's <i>Winged Bull,</i> which portrayed Crowley as a villain. <b>Note 1</b>:
The American avant-garde filmmaker Kenneth Anger supported Aleister
Crowley's occult theories and in 1955 he went to Cefalù to make a
documentary on Crowley's Abbey. Anger's most famous film is <i>Scorpio Rising</i>
(1964). Much of Anger's works have been done in Europe, mainly in
France, but abandoned during production and never exhibited. Among his
other films are <i>Fireworks</i> (1947),<i> Invocation of my Demon Brother</i> (1969), <i>Rabbit's Moon</i> (1971), <i>Lucifer Rising</i> (1973, rev. edition 1980). Books: <i>Hollywood Babylon</i> (first published in France in 1958), <i>Hollywood Babylon II (</i>1984).<b> Note 2</b></font><font size="-1">: After the rock star Jimmy Page started to collect Crowley's writings they have became hard to obtain.</font><font size="-1">
</font> <font size="-1">Also other rock musicians starting from The
Rolling Stones and The Beatles to David Bowie have been interested in
Crowley. The Beatles included him on the sleeve of <i>Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>. <b>For further reading:</b> <i>Magic of My Youth</i></font><font size="-1"> by A.
