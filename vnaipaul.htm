<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>









<p>Generally considered the leading novelist of the English-speaking
Caribbean, winner of the Nobel Prize in literature 2001. Naipaul's
writings dealt with the cultural confusion of the Third World and the
problem of an outsider, a feature of his own experience as an Indian in
the West Indies, a West Indian in England, and a nomadic intellectual
in a postcolonial world. Naipaul has also arisen much controversy
because of his politically incorrect views of the "half-made
societies." He has constantly refused to avoid unwelcome topics,
characterizing his role as a writer "to look and to look again, to
re-look and rethink." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The facts about Columbus have always been known. In 
his own writings and in all his actions his egoism is like an exposed deformity; he 
condemns himself. But the heroic gloss, which is not even his own, has come down through 
the centuries." </b>(in 'Columbus and Crusoe', </font><i><font size="2">The Overcrowded Barracoon</font></i><font size="2">, 1972)</font> </blockquote>
<p>Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was born in a small town in Trinidad
into a family of Indian Brahmin origin. His father, Seepersad Naipaul,
was a correspondent for the Trinidad Guardian. He also published short
stories. When Naipaul was six the family moved to Port of Spain, the
capital. Seepersad Naipaul died of a heart attack in 1953 without
witnessing the success of his son as a writer. He had encouraged
Naipaul in his writing aspirations, telling him in a letter: "Don't be
scared of being an artist. D. H. Lawrence was an artist through and
through; and, for the time being at any rate, you should think as
Lawrence. Remember what he used to say, 'Art for my sake.'" At the age
of 18 he had written his first novel which was rejected by the
publisher. </p>
<p>Naipaul was educated at Queen's Royal College, Port of Spain, and in
1950 he won a scholarship to Oxford. In 1949, after having some
pictures of himself taken for his application to the university,
Naipaul wrote to his elder sister: "I never knew my face was fat. The
picture said so. I looked at the Asiatic on the paper and thought that
an Indian from India could look no more Indian than I did... I had
hoped to send up a striking intellectual pose to the University people,
but look what they have got." After a nervous breakdown he tried to
commit suicide, but luckily the gas meter ran out. While at Oxford he
met Patricia Hale; they married in 1955. She died in 1996 from cancer
and Naipaul married Nadira Khannum Alvi, a divorced Pakistani
journalist. </p>

<p>On graduation Naipaul started his 
career as a freelance writer. During this period Naipaul felt himself rootless, but found 
his voice as a writer in the mid-1950s, when he started to examine his own Trinidadian background. 
From 1954 to 1956, Naipaul was a broadcaster for the BBC's Caribbean Voices, 
and between the years 1957 and 1961 he was a regular fiction reviewer for the <i>New Statesman</i>. </p>
<p>Naipaul published his first books in the late 1950s, but they did
not make much money for him or his publisher, André Deutsch Limited.
However, he knew his value as a writer and refused to write a review
for <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> for their usual fee. Naipaul's novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mystic Masseur </span>(1957), about a bright young man, who dreams of becoming a famous writer, was adapted for the screen by Ismail Merchant. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Miguel Street</span> (1959) was a
farewell to Port of Spain, Trinidad. The colorful characters of the
sketches include Bogart, who got his name from the film Casablanca, B.
Wordsworth who sells his poetry for four cents, and Man-man who in a
real mystery to the people of Miguel Street. The narrator is a boy who
grows up, starts to earn his own money and finally goes abroad to
study. "I left them all and walked briskly towards the aeroplane, not
looking back, looking only at my shadow before me, a dancing dwarf on
the tarmac." In later works Naipaul gave up comedic tones but in 1960
Charles Poore could write in his review of the book: "A comparison with
"Porgy and Bess" has been suggested. The parallel has at least the
merit of reminding us that the whole world is one. In that hospitable
mood we might also remember Mark Twain's tales of life on the
Mississippi. But Miguel Street, in Trinidad, is not really very much
like Catfish Row, nor are reminders of nineteenth-century Missouri
prevalent. What is true and, if you will, significant about Mr.
Naipaul's book is that it presents a world of its own excellently."<font size="2"> (<i>The New 
York Times</i>, </font><font size="2">May 5, 1960) </font></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">A House for Mr Biswas</span> (1961) is often regarded as Naipaul's masterpiece. It tells 
the tragicomic story of the search for independence and identity of a Brahmin Indian living 
in Trinidad. The protagonist, Mohun Biswas, was partly modelled after the author's father. Naipaul 
has said about this character and his father: "My father was a profounder 
man in every way. And his wounds are deeper than the other man can say. It's based on him, 
but it couldn't be the real man." Biswas has been unlucky from his birth, but all he 
wants is a house of his own &#8211; it is the solid basis of his existence. The story, which 
fuses social comedy and pathos, follows his struggle in variety of jobs, from sign painter to journalist, 
to his final triumph. Later Naipaul returned to his father in 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Between Father and Son</span> (1999), a record of their correspondence in the early 1950s. 
</p>
<p>In 1961, Naipaul received a grant from the Trinidad government to travel in the 
Caribbean. His first non-fiction book was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Middle Passage</span>
(1962), in which he described his first revisiting of the West Indies.
Its examination of racial tensions made black West Indians call Naipaul
a 'racist.' From the wide period of travels in the 1960s and early
1970s in India, South-America, Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia and
the USA, Naipaul produced among others<span style="font-style: italic;"> India: A Wounded Civilization</span> (1977), and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Bend in the River</span>
(1979), a pessimistic novel about Africa, proclaiming the
corruptibility of mankind. The story is set in a country very like
Zaïre or Uganda. Salim, the narrator is a Muslim, whose family, Indian
traders, has lived in Africa hundreds of years. Salim sets up a shop in
a town on the bend of the river and gains success, which has no future
in a country ruled by the Big Man, president for life. Again Naipaul's
protagonist is an outsider, who realizes that his way of life is almost
at its end and eventually he must give up everything. "The bush runs
itself. But there is no place to go," says Selim's friend Ferdinand,
when he rescues Selim from a jail. "The bush" is Naipaul metaphor for
the country and the whole third world. "Africa has no culture," Naipaul
has said. <a href="walcott.htm">Derek Walcott</a>,
the West Indian poet who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1992,
noted: "If Naipaul's attitude toward Negroes, with its nasty little
sneers... was turned on Jews, for example, how many people would praise
him for his frankness?" </p>
<p>Since the 1950s, Naipaul has lived in Britain, but traveled extensively. His essays and 
travel writings are often negative, unsentimental explorations of West Indian society as in 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Middle Passage</span> (1962). "The steel band used to be regarded as a high manifestation of 
West Indian culture, but it was a sound I detested." <span style="font-style: italic;">Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey </span>(1981) was accused 
by Muslim readers of narrow and selective vision of Islam. Naipaul searches the sources 
of the new Islam &#8211; and the ideological rage. "Islam sanctified 
rage &#8211; rage about the faith, political rage: one could be like the other. And more than 
once on this journey I had met sensitive men who were ready to contemplate great convulsions." 
<font size="2">(in <i>Among the Believers</i>)</font> Naipaul's latest 
travel books include <span style="font-style: italic;">Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions among the Converted Peoples</span>
(1998), intimate portraits from his journeys to the non-Arab Islamic
countries of Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Naipaul tries to
understand the fundamentalist fervour that have marked the Western
image of the region. "There probably has been no imperialism like that
of Islam and the Arabs," he writes. In Iran he meets war veterans, who
express their disillusionment and their sense of being manipulated by
the mullahs, and in Indonesia he meets his former friend, who opposed
the Suharto regime, and later became an establishment figure, an
advocate of an Islamicist future. On his first visit to India since he
was awarded the Nobel Prize, Naipaul said: "We are not here to
celebrate the antiquity of literature in India, but to celebrate modern
writing." </p>
<p>In his semi-autobiographical novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Enigma of Arrival</span>
(1987) Naipaul depicts a writer of Caribbean origin, who finds joys of
homecoming in England after wandering years &#8211; during which world
stopped being a colony for him. Central themes in Naipaul's works are
damaging effects of colonialism upon the people of the Third World, but
he doesn't believe in the imported ideas of revolutionaries or the
ability of the former colonies to avoid mistakes made by the Western
consumer societies. As a writer he has been compared to <a href="jconrad.htm">Joseph Conrad</a>
because of similar pessimistic portrayal of human nature and the themes
of exile and alienation. "Barbarism in India is very powerful because
it has a religious side," he once stated. In the essay 'Conrad's
Darkness' (pub. in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Return of Eva Peron</span>, 1980) Naipaul sees his own background as "one of the Conradian 
dark places of the earth." </p>
<p>In the 1990s, Naipaul concentrated on non-fiction. His long-awaited novel, 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">A Way in the World</span> (1994), was an autobiography and a fictional history of colonialism, presenting 
stories from the times of Sir Walter Raleigh to the nineteenth-century revolutionary 
Franciso Miranda. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Half a Life </span>(2001)
the protagonist is Willie Somerset Chandran, born in India in the
1930s. His second name he has got from the English writer <a href="maugham.htm">Somerset Maugham</a>,
who has met his father. Willie moves to London, drifts in bohemian
circles, publishes a book, marries Ana, a woman of mixed African
descent, and moves with her to Africa, to her family estate. Willie has
problems to come in terms with himself, as the son of a Brahman, who
has married an "untouchable." His father is a rebel who ends at a
monastery. Willie rebels against his own background and the wishes of
his father, with whom he has more in common than he admits. In his
wife's home country, in which colonial system is breaking down, Willie
is also an outsider. After eighteen years he decides to leave her, and
find his true identity. He has lived half a life, a shadow life, but
Naipaul doesn't tell will happen to him. Willie's existential search
continues and the rest of his story is left open. </p>
<p>Willie's decision parallels with the history of the relationship between the American writer 
Paul Theroux and Naipaul. Theroux depicted his decades long 
friendship with Naipaul in <i>Sir Vidia's Shadow</i> (1998). In this angry and unforgiving 
book Theroux eventually is rejected by Naipaul and he realizes he has come out Naipaul's shadow, he 
is free. Theroux considered earlier the older writer as his mentor but the friendship 
ended in breakup, which Theroux sealed with his bitter accusations. <font size="2">
</font>"I had admired his talent. After a while I admired nothing else. Finally 
I began to wonder about his talent, seriously to wonder, and doubted it when I found myself 
skipping pages in his more recent books. In the past I would have said the fault was mine. 
Now I knew that he could be the monomaniac in print that he was in person." <font size="2">
(in</font><i><font size="2"> Sir Vidia's Shadow</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>

<p>Besides the Nobel Prize, Naipaul's 
several literary awards include the Booker Prize for<span style="font-style: italic;"> In a Free State </span>(1971). He was knighted 
in 1989 and in 1993 he won the first David Cohen British Literature Prize for "lifetime 
achievement by a living British writer". Naipaul's manuscripts and extensive archives 
have been deposited in the University of Tulsa. At a speech in October 2004 
Naipaul announced that <span style="font-style: italic;">Magic Seeds</span> (2004), the sequel to <i>Half a Life</i>, may be his last novel. 
"I have no faith in the survival of the novel," he said. 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Masque of Africa </span>(2010), a self-searching journey to 
"the beginning of things", was Naipaul's 16th volume of nonfiction.&nbsp; </p><p>Naipaul's
ability to stir up public debate&nbsp;is widely recognised. In 2011 he
said&nbsp; in an interview at the Royal Geographic Society:&nbsp; "I
read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it
is by a woman or not. I think [it is] unequal to me."&nbsp;Naipaul
criticized&nbsp;female writers for&nbsp;"sentimentality" and "narrow
view of the world". As a response, the&nbsp; New Zealand novelist <a href="hulme.htm">Keri Hulme</a> called Naipaul&nbsp; "a misogynist prick whose works are dying". </p>
