<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist, essayist and playwright,
who received the 1957 Nobel Prize for literature. Camus was closely linked
to his fellow existentialist <a href="sartre.htm">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> in the
1940s, but he broke with him over Sartre's support to Stalinist politics.
Camus died at the age of forty-six in a car accident near Sens, France. Among his best-known novels are <i>The Stranger </i>(1942) and <i>The Plague</i> (1947). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I
don't know. I had a telegram from the home: 'Mother passed away.
Funeral tomorrow. Yours sincerely.' That doesn't mean anything. It may
have happened yesterday." </b></font><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Stranger</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Albert Camus was born in Mondovi, Algeria, into a working-class
family. Camus's mother, Catherine Hélène Sintés, was an illiterate
cleaning woman. She came from a family of Spanish origin. Lucien
Auguste Camus, his father, was an itinerant agricultural laborer. He
died of his wounds in 1914 after the Battle of the Marne &#8211; Camus was
less than a year old at that time. His body was never sent to Algeria.
During the war, Catherine Hélène worked in a factory. She was partly
deaf, due to a stroke that permanently impaired her speech, but she was
able to read lips. In their home "things had no names", as Camus later
recalled. But he loved his mother intensely: "When my mother's eyes
were not resting on me, I have never been able to look at her without
tears springing into my eyes." </p>
<p>In 1923 Camus won a scholarship to the lycée in Algiers, where he
studied from 1924 to 1932. Incipient tuberculosis put an end to his
athletic activities. The disease was to trouble Camus for the rest of
his life. Between the years 1935 and 1939
Camus held various jobs in Algiers. He also joined the Communist Party,
but his interest in the works of Marx and Engels was rather
superficial. More important writers in his circle were André Malraux
and André Gide.</p>

<p>In 1936 Camus received his <i>diplôme d'étudies supérieures</i> from the University of Algiers in philosophy. To recover his health he made his first visit to Europe. Camus' first book, <em>L'Envers et l'endroit</em>
(1937), was a collection of essays, which he wrote at the age of
twenty-two. Camus dedicated it to his philosophy teacher, Jean Grenier.
The philosopher Brice Parain maintained that the little book contained
Camus' best work, although the author himself considered the form of
his writings clumsy. </p>

<p>By this time Camus' reputation in Algeria as a leading writer was
growing. He was also active in theater. In 1938 Camus moved to France.
Next year he divorced his first wife, Simone Hié, who was a morphine
addict. From 1938 to 1940 Camus worked for the <i>Alger-Républicain</i>, reviewing among others Sartre's books, and in 1940 for <i>Paris-Soir</i>.
In 1940 he married Francine Faure, a pianist and mathematician. When
the Allied landed in North Africa in 1942, Camus was&nbsp;convalescing
at Le Panier on a farm from a recurrence of his tuberculosis. Francine
had returned to her teaching post in Algeria. Camus, who wrote in his
journal of celibacy and&nbsp;deprivation,&nbsp;was cut him off from his
wife until the end of the war.</p>

<p>During WW II Camus was member of the French resistance. He made
biweekly trips for treatment in nearby Saint-Étienne, which was a
center of Resistace activity, too. From 1943 he worked as a reader and
editor of Espoir series at Gallimard publisher.&nbsp;Camus met Sartre
and Beauvoir in Paris at the opening performance of <em>Les Mouches</em> in 1943; they talked about books. Sartre had given his works good reviews in the <em>Alger Républicain</em>. With Sartre he founded the left-wing Resistance newspaper <i>Combat</i>, serving as its editor. However, it was Beauvoir who authored Sartre's first <span style="font-style: italic;">Combat</span> articles. She had hoped to have an affair with Camus, who fell&nbsp; in love with&nbsp; <a href="koestler.htm">Arthur Koestler</a>'s partner Mamaine and Koestler had a one-night stand with Beauvoir. <br>
</p>
      <p>Camu's second novel,&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>L'Étranger</em></span>
(The Stranger), which he had begun in Algeria before the war, appeared
in 1942. It has been considered one of the greatest of all hard-boiled
novels. Camus admired the American tough novel and wrote in <i>The Rebel</i> (1951) that <b><font size="2">"</font></b>it
does not choose feelings or passions to give a detailed description of,
such as we find in classic French novels. It rejects analysis and the
search for a fundamental psychological motive that could explain and
recapitulate the behavior of a character..." </p>


<p>The story of <i>The Stranger</i> is narrated by a doomed character,
Mersault, and is set between two deaths, his mother's and his own.
Mersault is a clerk, who seems to have no feelings and spends
afternoons in lovemaking and empty nights in the cinema. Like
Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov from <i>Crime and Punishment</i> (1866), he
reaches self-knowledge by committing a crime &#8211; he shoots an Arab on the
beach without explicit reason and motivation &#8211; it was hot, the Arab had
earlier terrorized him and his friend Raymond, and he had an headache.
Mersault is condemned to die as much for his refusal to accept the
standards of social behavior as for the crime itself. "The absurd man
will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of
his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions, and
without resignation either. He stares at death with passionate
attention and this fascination liberates him. He experiences the
"divine irresponsibility" of the condemned man." <font size="2">(Sartre's analysis of Mersault, in </font><i><font size="2">Literary and Philosophical Essays</font></i><font size="2">, 1943)</font> Camus himself argued that there were few points of contact between his notion of the Absurd and Sartrean existentialism. </p>
<p>In the cell Mersault faces the reality for the first time, and his
consciousness awakens. "It was as if that great rush of anger had
washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and gazing up at the dark sky
spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I
laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe." Luchino
Visconti's film version from 1967 meticulously reconstructed an Algiers
street so that it looked exactly as it had during 1938-39, when the
story takes place. But the 43-year-old Marcello Mastroianni, playing
30-year-old Mesault, was considered too old, although otherwise his
performance was praised. </p>
<p>Camus' philosophical essay <span class="st"><em>Le Mythe de Sisyphe</em> (1942) </span>starts
with the famous statement: "There is only one really serious
philosophical question, and that is suicide. Deciding whether or not
life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in
philosophy. All other questions follow from that."<b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"></font><i> </i>Camus
compares the absurdity of the existence of humanity to the labours of
the mythical character Sisyphus, who was condemned through all eternity
to push a boulder to the top of a hill and watch helplessly as it
rolled down again. Camus takes the nonexistence of God granted and
finds meaning in the struggle itself.</p>

<p>"A novel is never anything but a philosophy put into images," Camus
wrote. He admired Sartre's gift's as a novelist, but did not find his
two sides, philosophy and storytelling, both equally convincing. In an
essay written in 1952 he praises Melville's <i>Billy Budd</i>.
Melville, according to Camus, "never cut himself off from flesh or
nature, which are barely perceptible in Kafka's work." Camus also
admired <a href="faulkner.htm">William Faulkner</a> and made a dramatic adaptation of Faulkner's <i>Requiem for a Nun</i>.
In 1946 Camus spent some time in New York, and wrote: "I don't have a
precise idea about New York myself, even after so many days, but it
continues to irritate me and seduce me at the same time." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is not rebellion itself which is noble but the demands it makes upon us."</b> (<i>The Plague</i>, 1947) </font></blockquote>

<p>Camus did not take his succes well while Sartre enjoyed his celebrity in the postwar France. In 1947 Camus resigned from <i>Combat</i> and published in the same year 
his third novel, <em>La Peste</em>,
an allegory of the Nazi occupation of France. The Algerian city of
Oran&nbsp;is abruptly forced to live within narrow boundaries under a
terror&nbsp;&#8211; death is loose on the streets. In the besieged&nbsp;town
some people try to act morally, some are cowards, some lovers.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"None
the less, he knew that the tale he had to tell could be one of a final
victory. It could only be the record of what had had to be done, and
what assuredly would have to be done again in the never-ending fight
against terror and its relentless onslaughts, despite their personal
afflictions, by all who, while unable to be saints but refusing to bow
down to pestilences, strive their utmost to be healers." The Algerian
War had a huge impact on French society, enflaming and radicalizing
both the Left and the Right. Horrified by the bloodshed, Camus
condemned all violence, and found himself between hostile camps; he
both rejected Algerian independence and supported equal political
rights for Arab citizens, which made him an isolated figure.&nbsp; <br>
 </p>
<p>Before his break with Sartre, who had decided to side with Communism, Camus wrote <span class="st"><em>L'Homme Révolté</em> </span>(1951, Man in Revolt), which explores the theories and forms of humanity's 
revolt against authority. The book was criticized in Sartre's <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Temps modernes</span>
by a junior member of the journal, Francis Jeanson. Camus was offended
and wrote a seventeen-page reply to "M. Le Directeur" (To the Editor),
never once mentioning Jeanson. Sartre responded with a scornful letter:
"You do us the honor of contributing to this issue of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Les Temps modernes</span>, but you bring a portable pedestal with you." <br>
</p>
      <p>Following Sartre's attack Camus stayed away from places where
he used to see his former friend. Moreover, he saw the success of
Beauvor's novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mandarins</span> as directed against him. From 1955 to 1956 Camus worked as a journalist
for <i>L'Express</i>. Among his major works from the late-1950s&nbsp;is<em>&nbsp;La Chute</em>
&nbsp;(1956), an ironic novel in which the penitent judge Jean-Baptiste
Clamence confesses his own moral crimes to a strager in an Amsterdam
bar. Jean-Baptiste reveals his hypocrisy, but at the same time his
monologue becomes an attack on modern man. </p>

<p>When Camus heard, that he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature, he
stated publicly that he would have voted for Malraux. At the time of
his death, Camus was planning to direct a theater company of his own
and to write a major novel about growing up in Algeria. Several of the
short stories in&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>L'Exil et le Royaume</em>&nbsp;</span> (1957) were set in Algeria's coastal towns and inhospitale sands. The unfinished novel <em>La Mort heureuse</em>
(1970) was written in 1936-38. It presented the young Camus, or Patrice
Mersault, seeking his happiness from Prague to his hometown in Algiers,
announcing towards the end of the book "What matters &#8211; all that
matters, really &#8211; is the will to happiness, a kind of enormous,
ever-present consciousness. The rest &#8211; women, art, success &#8211; is nothing
but excuses." In <span class="st"><em>Le Premier Homme</em> </span>(1994),
the story of Jacques Cormery, Camus charted the history of his family
and his lycée years. The manuscript was found in the car, a Facel Vega,
in which he died on January 4, 1960.</p>
