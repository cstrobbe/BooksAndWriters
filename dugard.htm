<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist, dramatist and winner of 
the 1937 Nobel Prize for Literature. Martin du Gard was originally trained 
as an archivist and expert in old handwriting. His literary fame rests on his eight-part novel <i>The World of the Thibaults</i>,
which continued the tradition of Stendhal and Tolstoy in its wide
historical scope. Martin du Gard often juxtaposed two&nbsp;brothers,
one seeking evolution, the other revolution,&nbsp;and studied through
their conflict social, philosophical and religious problems. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"One can love the people and not be able
to stand their ongoing company. One can love the populace and not like
to live with the individuals who compose it. Their ways of being and of
thinking, their ways of being happy or unhappy, their desires, their
welfare, their joys, their emotions, their sensitivity, their reactions
are not my own; and I am a foreigner among them. My climate is not
theirs. Whenever circumstances have forced me into contact with them, I
have suffered from it." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort</font></i><font size="2">, 1941) </font></blockquote>
<p>Roger Martin du Gard was born in the Paris suburb of
Neuilly-sur-Seine. His father was a prosperous lawyer and his mother
came from a family of stockbrokers. At the age of seventeen Martin du
Gard read <a href="ltolstoi.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>'s <i>War and Peace</i>, which inspired him later in the<i> Thibault </i>saga.
He entered the École des Chartres in Paris and received his diploma as
a paleographer-archivist in 1905. Next year he married Hèléne Foucault,
and settled in Paris. Their marriage failed; the only child,
Christiane, became the battleground for the parents. She eventually
married Martin du Gard's closest friend, who was a quarter of a century
older than she. </p>
<p><em>Devenir!,</em> (1907), which Martin du Gard's published at his
own expense, was&nbsp;a story about a man who fails as an author.
Earlier Martin du Gard had abandoned his first novel, <i>Une vie de saint</i>, which gives the work self-confessional background. His breakthrough came with the novel<em> Jean Barois</em>, (1912), &nbsp;fictional portrait of the <a href="ezola.htm">Dreyfuss</a>
scandal, written partially under the influence of Marcel Hébert, a
modernist priest. Using then largely experimental technique of
juxtaposing dialogue and historical documentation, Martin du Gard
described the mental struggle of reason and Roman Catholic faith in the
person of his young hero, Jean Barois, a polemical journalist. From his
youthful rebellion against religious beliefs Barois moves toward
religion in his old age, and dies his spirit broken. Against his
development Martin du Gard sets Luce, who maintains his liberated
stance to the end. </p>
<p>The book was published on the recommendation of <a href="agide.htm">André 
Gide</a>,
who became his close friend, but whose attitude to the Catholic
religion and Church was more uncritical. Martin du Gard also shared
some of his sexual interest. In the dark and dramatic play<em> Un taciturne</em> (1931) he dealt with homosexual themes. The play was showed at the Louis Jouvet Theatre. While working on <em>Le Lieutenant-colonel de Maumort</em>,
Martin du Gard compiled a dossier in which he argued that homosexuality
is a natural condition. However, although the atmosphere of Paris was
relatively tolerant, he instructed Gide not to confess his sexual
orientation. Gide was subject in his essays&nbsp;<em>Notes&nbsp;sur André Gide</em>&nbsp;(1951), based on his journals. Martin du Gard's correspondence with André Gide was published in 1968. </p>
<p>Martin du Gard's peasant farce, <em>Le Testament du père Leleu</em>
(1914) was performed at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier. During World
War I Martin du Gard served in the French Army in a motor transport
division on the western front. After the war he worked briefly at a
theater. Tired of the literary life of Paris, Martin du Gard withdrew
to Le Tertre, a Norman country estate at Bellême. There he wrote his
masterpiece, <em>Les Thibault</em>,
published between 1922 and 1940.
Noteworthy, before the Nobel Prize, his work failed to generate any
significant debate. Martin du Gard himself declined to discuss his own
political or philosophical views and did not offer concrete solutions
on how peace and justice he advocated could be established in the
world. The ceremony at which he received the
Nobel prize, embarrassed him. </p><p>The novels follow two bourgeois
families, one Catholic and the other Protestant, and depict the
degeneration of society prior WW I. The principal characters are
Jacques Thibaut, a socialist revolutionary, and his brother Antoine, a
Cartesian doctor who seeks change through evolution. Jacques and
Antoine are opposing personalities &#8211; when one is restless the other is
calm &#8211; and the first two volumes of the series focus on their conflict.
Both fail to see the signs of the approaching war; their blindness is
the universal blindness of mankind. Jacques distributes pacifist
pamphlets by air, his plane crashes and he is accidentally shot as a
spy. The birth and growth of his son, Jean-Paul, symbolizes the
contonuation of his fight. Antoine is caught by a gas attack. His
health rapidly deteriorates
but he keeps a diary recording his thoughts. "I am condemned to die
without having much understanding of myself or the world," he says.  <br>
 </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">Martin du
Gard was not by his own account a very cheerful man; he even thought in
his bluer moments that as a maker of fiction -- and despite his
success, which included the 1937 Nobel Prize in Literature -- he had
come to the novel a generation too late. Fine writing wasn't his thing,
objectivity was: he thought that a novelist should give us the material
world -- the places, people, things that fill it to overflowing -- as
plainly and substantively as he knew how, with all the ample
transparency of a novel like </font><i><font size="2">War and Peace</font></i><font size="2">.</font><font size="2">"</font></b><font size="2"> (</font><font size="2">John Sturrock </font><font size="2">in <i>The New York Times</i>, </font><font size="2">January 23, 2000</font><font size="2">) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>An automobile accident in 1931, in which Martin du Gard and his wife
were injured, made the author reexamine his plans for the rest of <i>Les Thibault</i>.
He adopted a documentary technique and changed the story from a
primarily psychological study to a historical account of the events
that led to the outbreak of World War I. After the German invasion in
1940, Martin du Gard fled to Nice where he spent the war years. Writing
of the difficulties living in France he said, that "not only are we
going to starve, but we will freeze as well." </p>
<p>Disillusioned after the war, Martin du Gard said to his friend
Jacques Schiffrin, "Europe is finished. There are only ruins." Martin
du Gard's last large novel was <em>Le Lieutenant-colonel de Maumort</em>,
on which he worked for 17 years. He changed the plan of the book
several times, and eventually it was left unfinished. The narrator of
the story is a professional soldier, Bertrand de Maumort, whose life,
loves, and disappointments the author follows through decades from his
childhood to the years of World War II. </p>
<p>André Schiffrin described in his book of memoir,<i> A Political Education </i>(2007)
the author in his old age as "warm and friendly and very approachable,
known for his welcoming smile and total lack of hauteur." Martin du
Gard died in Bellême on August 23, 1958, at the age of seventy-seven.
His<em> </em><span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Correspondance générale</em> </span></span>(1980-)
reveals a passionate, independent artist, who set such high standards
for himself that he destroyed several completed manuscripts. Martin du
Gard was associated with the men of <i>La Nouvelle Revue Française</i>,
but introverted and socially restrained, he did not accept the
membership of the Académie Français. Jean Cocteau once said of his
works, that an "author's work so truly reveals his solitude, that one
wonders what strange urge of contact compels him to publish it." </p>
