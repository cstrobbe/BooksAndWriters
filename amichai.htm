<p>Israeli poet, who also published short stories, novels, and plays.
Amichai was among the first to compose poems in colloquial Israeli
Hebrew. His language is gently ironic, sometimes passionate or
straightforward, or even emotionally dry. Memories from childhood
appear in Amichai's work as nostalgic glimpses into a world of peace
and innocence: "Remember: even the departure to terrible battles /
Passes by gardens and windows / And children playing, a dog barking."
Many of his poems are addressed to Jerusalem. Amichai's own life was
closely linked to the birth and battle for existence of the State of
Israel. In 1982 he received the Israel Prize of Poetry, his country's
highest honor. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>If I forget thee, Jerusalem, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Then let my right be forgotten. </font><br>
<font size="2">Let my right be forgotten, and my left remember. </font><br>
<font size="2">Let my left remember, and your right close </font><br>
<font size="2">And your mouth open near the gate. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem') </font></blockquote>
<p>Yehuda Amichai was born in Würzburg, Germany, to a merchant family
of Orthodox Jews. His ancestors had lived there in southern Germany
since the Middle Ages. After the Nazis came to power, his family
emigrated to Palestine in 1935, and settled finally in Jerusalem. In an
early poem he confessed: "And my parents' migration has not yet calmed
in me. / My blood goes on shaking at its walls, / As the bowl after it
is set down." Amichai studied Hebrew from early childhood and received
a religious education. <br>
</p>
      <p>During World War II Amichai served in the Jewish
Brigade of the British Army. Later, during the War of Independence, he
fought as a commando with the Haganah underground. He was also in
active duty in the army in 1956 and 1973. These experiences mark many
of his poems. In 'Tel Gath' he returned to his own past: "I brought my
children to the mound / Where once I fought battles, / So they would
understand the things I did do / And forgive me for the things I didn't
do." In another poem, 'The U.N. Headquarters in the High Commissioner's
House in Jerusalem', Amichai viewed bitterly the role of the
international community in his country, which had become a playground
of peace negotiators: "And their secretaries are lipsticked and
laughing, / and their sturdy chauffeurs wait below, like horses in a
stable, / and the trees that shade them have their roots in no-man's
land / and the illusions are children who went out to find cyclamen in
the field / and do not come back."</p>

<p>Amichai studied at the Hebrew University, and then earned his living
by teaching the Bible and Hebrew literature in secondary schools.
Amichai had started to write poetry in 1949. His first collection, <span style="font-style: italic;">Akhshav uva-yamim ha-aherim</span>, came out in 1955. With his second collection,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Be-merhak shete tikvot</span>
(1958), Amichai established himself as one of the major poets of the
'Palmach generation', writers who emerged out of Israeli's war for
independence. It included such names as Nathan Zach (b. 1930), Dalia
Ravikovitch, T. Carmi, and Dan Pagis. </p>
<p>Much of Amichai's fiction is autobiographical. "My personal history
has coincided with a larger history," he has said. "For me it's always
been one and the same." His first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lo me-&#699;akhshav&#803; lo mi-kan</span> 
(1963, Not of This Time, Not of This Place) was about a young German
Jew living in Israel after World War II and trying to understand the
world which had created the Holocaust. His second novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mi yitneni malon</span>
(1971), was about an Israeli poet living in New York. It was published
while Amichai was a visiting poet at an American college. In 1971 and
1976 he was a visiting professor at the University of California,
Berkeley, and Dorot Visiting Fellowship (1983-84), and a visiting poet
at New York University (1987). </p>
<p>In the background of Amichai's work is the biblical Hebrew, in which
he incorporates colloquial expressions and language of the modern day
world. Sometimes it follows the rhythms of biblical language. In
'National thoughts' Amichai wrote: "To speak, now, in this tired
language, / Torn from its sleep in the Bible &#8211; / Blinded, it lurches
from mouth to mouth &#8211; / The language which described God and the
Miracles, / Says: / Motor car, bomb, God." Grief, unresolved. hidden
rage, and irony are elements of 'The Smell of gasoline Ascends in My
Nose', in which the army jet "makes peace in the heavens / upon us and
upon all lovers in autumn". </p>
<p>Amichai's poems have often been recited on public occasions. Yitzhak
Rabin read lines from his famous early work, 'God Has Pity on
Kindergarten Children,' as part of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance
speech. In the poem Amichai continues the title line with the words:
"He has less pity on school children / And on grownups he has no pity at
all". </p>
<p>According to a story by Chana Bloch, "some Israeli students were
called up in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. As soon as they were notified,
they went back to their rooms at the university, and each packed his
gear, a rifle, and a book of Yehuda Amichai's poems." <font size="2">(from the introduction to<i> The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai</i>, 1986) </font>However,
similar stories have been told about young Russian, French, German etc.
soldiers who take a book by their favorite poet to the front. In the
1970s the English poet <a href="thughes.htm">Ted Hughes</a> made
Amichai's work known to English and American readers. Amichai died in
Jerusalem on September 22, 2000. He was married twice: first to Tamar
Horn; they had one son, and then to Chang Sokolov; they had one son and
one daughter. Amichai's works have been translated into some thirty
languages and appeared in a number of anthologies. "He should have won
the Nobel Prize in any of the last 20 years," wrote Jonathan Wilson in <i>The New York Times </i><font size="2">(December 10, 2000)</font>,
"but he knew that as far as the Scandinavian judges were concerned, and
whatever his personal politics, which were indubitably on the dovish
side, he came from the wrong side of the stockade." </p>
