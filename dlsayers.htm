      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British novelist, essayist,
medieval scholar
and anthologist. Sayers is best-known for her stories about the amateur
aristocratic detective hero Lord
Peter Wimsey, who made his breakthrough in the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Whose Body?</span> (1923), wearing a top
hat like Fred Astaire. After the late 1930s, Sayers wrote no more
detective novels,
but concentrated on theological dramas, radio plays and verse. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Lord Peter's library was one of
the most delightful bachelor rooms in London. Its scheme was black and
primrose; its walls were lined with rare editions, and its chairs and
Chesterfield sofa suggested the embraces of the houris. In one corner
stood a black baby-grand, and wood fire leaped on a wide old-fashioned
hearth, and the Sevres vases on the chimney-piece were filled with
ruddy and gold chrysanthemums."</b> (from <i>Whose Body?</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Dorothy Leigh Sayers was born in Oxford, the daughter of the
Rev. Henry Sayers, the director of the Christchurch Cathedral Choir
School, and Helen Mary (Leigh) Sayers. From the early age Sayers was
very gifted in languages, learning Latin by the age of seven and French
from her governess. In 1912 she won a scholarship to the Oxford women's
college Somerville, and in Her first book, a verse collection titled OP
I, she published at the age of 23</p>
      <p> Sayers earned her M.A. in 1920, among one of the first group
of women to be granted degrees from Oxford University. She then worked
in Yorkshire and in France, where she was a secretary to a
shell-shocked veteran, and as a reader for an Oxford publishing house.
During these years Sayers went through a period she did not advertise
much later. She had an illegitimate son, Anthony, who was brought up by
her cousin, Ivy Shrimpton, in Westcott Barton. In the village she was
known as a very eccentric figure. The father was Bill White, a
motorcyclist and car salesman. Sayers rejected contraceptives, which
caused a problem with her lover, the Russian born-novelist John
Cournos, whom she met in 1921. Sayers wanted to marry him, but Cournos
told that he did not believe in marriage. Letters from this unhappy
affair are now housed at Harvad University. Although her cousin took
care of the child, Sayers followed closely his upbringing and supplied
funds for this purpose. Sayers kept the child secret even from her
parents. John Anthony Fleming was unofficially adopted by Sayers and
her husband when he went to boarding school. </p>
      <p> Sayers's seven-year long job at Benson's advertising agency
in London began in 1922. Soon after joining the agency she published
the novel, <i>Whose Body?</i> in which Wimsey is the major character.
In the story Lord Peter solves the puzzle of the body in the bath.
Wimsey's prime criteria is to find out how the murder was done.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"Once you've got the How, the Why drives it
home," says the detective in <span style="font-style: italic;">Busman's
Honeymoon</span> (1937). In 1926 Sayers married the journalist, Captain
Oswald Arthur Fleming, who was divorced and had two children. "Mac" as
he was called, was Scottish. He died in 1950. During the last years of
his life, he did little but drink at the local pub. <span style="font-style: italic;">Unnatural Death</span> (1927) was written
in the year of Sayers's marriage. Its most interesting character is
Miss Climpson, a spinster-sleuth, whom Lord Peter has employed, and who
had feared a future without marriage. However, she has found her proper
job. </p>
      <p>Wimsey was featured in 11 novels and 21 stories. In the
beginning of the series the young protagonist is a carefree war hero,
whose character still is defined by the intellectual style of the
Edwardian age and Wodehousian wit. Wimsey has money, free time and he
knows the important people. His political views are crystallized in the
contempt for "bosheviks". Wimsey's professional companion is Charler
Parker. When Lord Peter is impulsive, Parker has cautious and solid
character. Gradually Wimsey developed into a man of conscience and
moral responsibility, but humor prevailed throughout the novel series.
"The essential Peter," Sayers once wrote, "is seen to be the familiar
figure of the interpretative artists, the romantic soul at war with a
realistic brain." Lord Peter Wimsey appeared for the first time on the
screen in <i>The Silent Passenger</i> (1935). Peter Haddon portrayed
the amateur sleuth. </p>
      <p> In <i>Busman's Honeymoon</i> the monocled detective marries
Harriet Vane, a writer of mystery books, Sayers's own alter ego. Vane
was introduced in <span style="font-style: italic;">Strong Poison</span>
(1930), in which Lord Peter saves her. She is accused of poisoning the
novelist Philip Boyes, her lover with whom she had lived for almost a
year. Bournos, like John Cournos, claimed he did not believe in
marriage &#8211; obviously the novel's satire was a kind of payback. The love
interest between Harriet and Lord Peter began to build from <span style="font-style: italic;">Have His Carcase</span> (1932), in which
Harriet discovers a dead body on the beach and she is again suspected
of the murder. <span style="font-style: italic;">Murder Must Advertise</span>
(1933) was full of observations of manner and mocked the superficial
world of conspicuous consumption. The critic and awarded mystery writer
H.R.F. Keating included <span style="font-style: italic;">The Nine
Tailors</span> (1934) in 1987 among the 100 best crime and mystery
books ever published. The story is famous for its detailed account of
the art of bell-ringing. </p>
      <p>With such writers as G.K. Chesterton, Christie, and Fr. Ronald
Knox, Sayers founded the Detection Club in 1929. She purchased a home
at Witham in Essex, and from 1931 Sayers devoted herself entirely to
writing and preparing radio plays for the BBC. In 1932 Sayers began to
write memoirs of her childhood. She abandoned the project after
thirty-six pages but used them later in the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Cat O'Mary</span>, which
was never published. </p>
      <p>After the appearance of <i>Busman's Honeymoon </i>Sayers
turned from mystery fiction to other genres. Her only detective novel
without Wimsey was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Documents in
the Case</span> (1930), co-written with Robert Eustace. She published
also 11 short stories in which the commercial traveller Montague Egg
solved crimes, and wrote with members of The Detection Club such
composite novels as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Floating
Admiral</span> (1931), <span style="font-style: italic;">Ask a
Policeman</span> (1933), and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Double
Death: a Murder Story</span> (1939). </p>
      <p>A devout Anglo-Catholic, Sayers was for many years a friend of
the Oxford writers known as the <a href="tolkien.htm">Inklings</a>. In<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Mind of the Maker</span> Sayers tried
to explain the Trinitarian nature of God, the Divine Creator, by
analogy with the three-fold activity of the creative artist&#8212;involving
idea, energy, and power. With few exceptions her plays were religious
dramas, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">The Zeal of Thy
House</span> (1937), set in the twelfth century and based on an
incident that had occurred during the burning and rebuilding of the
choir at Canterbury, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Devil
to Pay</span> (1939). The play-cycle <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Man Born to be King</span> (1942) was about the life of Christ. As a
religious writer Sayers aimed for high literary quality, but she
occasionally suffered hair loss when she got under stress. </p>
      <p>In 1950 Sayers was awarded a Litt.D. by the University of
Durham. Her last major accomplishment was translation of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Sayers came to know Dante rather late in life, but she lectured on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Commedia</span> at Cambridge University in 1947 and 1948. Sayers's Penguin
Classics version, which received mostly favourable reviews at the time
of its publication, has been widely used and is still well-known.Her fast-paced text, in Victorian style verse, took
many liberties with the original. The "Paradiso" was finished by Barbara
Reynolds after Sayers's death on December 17, 1957 from a heart
failure. In Clive James' recent translation of Dante's  <span style="font-style: italic;">Divine Comedy</span> the work was dismissed as being loaded with cliché and pumped full of wind. <br>
 </p>
      <p>Sayers put aside her 13th full-length Lord Peter novel in
1938. The book, which was finished by Jill Paton Walsh, appeared in
1998 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Thrones,
Dominations</span>. Set in 1936, the story revolves around the murder
of two beautiful young women. There's also a subplot involving the new
King, Edward VIII, succeeded to the throne on the death of his father,
King George V. </p>
      <p>Sayers's mystery novels have received serious attention from
academic critics, partly because of her other works. Q.D. Leavis
attacked as early as in the 1930s this attitude in her article 'The
Case of Miss Dorothy Sayers: <i>Gaudy Night</i> and <i>Busman's
Honeymoon</i>' in <i>Scrutiny</i>, Vol. VI (1937): "Literature gets
heavily drawn upon in Miss Sayers's writings, and her attitude to it is
revealing. She displays knowingness about literature without any
sensitiveness to it or any feeling for quality&#8212;i.e. she has an academic
literary taste over and above having no general taste at all." </p>
