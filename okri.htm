<p>Nigerian novelist, short story writer, and poet, one of the leading
African writers. In his work Okri has experimented with new literary
forms, different styles, genres, and traditions. Okri started as a
realist, with postcolonial themes. After exploring with stream of
consciousness Okri published novels which mixed realism, modernism, and
oral forms, especially those of Yoruba culture. This style has been
characterized as an example of magic realism with African flavor,
although the author himself has emphasized the realistic dimensions of
his work &#8211; myths and local beliefs are part of the real world, urban
life-world, not that they exist next to the real world. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"We are the miracles that God made </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">To taste the bitter fruit of Time. </font><br>
<font size="2">We are precious. </font><br>
<font size="2">And one day our suffering </font><br>
<font size="2">Will turn into the wonders of earth." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'An African Elegy',<font size="2"> 1992</font>) </font></blockquote>
<p>Ben Okri, a member of the Urhobo people, was born in Minna to Grace
and Silver Okri. After his birth his father, Silver Oghenegueke Loloje
Okri, a railway clerk, moved to England to study law on a scholarship.
Okri spent his earliest years in Peckham, south London. He attended a
primary school there but returned with his family to Nigeria aged
seven. His father practiced in Lagos among those who could not afford
normal legal fees &#8211; this later gave material for the author's fiction.
Okri's childhood was shadowed by the Nigerian civil war (the Biafran
War). As a child he read widely, and his mother told him many African
stories. He attended Urhobo College, Warri, for a few years. Because
the war constantly interrupted his schooling, he was largely educated
at home in Lagos.</p>
<p>After finishing his high school Okri worked as a clerk at a paint store. He failed to get a place 
at the university and started to write articles on social and political issues. Most of them were not 
published, but when he wrote short stories based on these articles, they found readers in women's 
journals and evening papers. At the age of nineteen he completed his first novel, <i>Flowers and 
Shadows</i> (1980), about a successful businessman whose jealous relatives make his life difficult. 
The story was written in the broad tradition of Realism. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1978 Okri moved to England where he 
studied comparative literature at Essex University. This period was difficult in Okri's life. 
He slept on the floor of his friend, wrote a play, <em>Waiting for a Room</em>, 
which premiered in the university theatre and was produced by Jan Szafranski. 
In 1981/82 he moved to live with his girl friend. 
Because of lack of funds, he was forced to leave the university without taking a degree. 
Okri was a poetry editor of <i>West Africa </i>and worked also for the BBC. 
In 1984 one of his stories was selected by Peter Ackroyd in the PEN New Fiction contest. </p>

<p>Okri' second novel, <i>The Landscapes Within</i> (1981), traced the
adventures of a young and poor painter in Lagos. "Ghetto-dwellers are
the great fantasists," Okri said in an interview. "There was an
extraordinary vibrancy there, an imaginative life. When you are that
poor, all you've got left is your belief in the imagination." Omovo
happily accepts his surroundings but becomes a painter. The novel was
followed by two collections of short stories, <i>Incidents at the Shrine</i> (1986) and <i>Stars of the New Curfew</i>
(1988), in which Okri started to experiment with new narrative
techniques. Several of the stories dealt with the Biafran War, seen
from a child's point of view. </p>

<p><i>The Famished Road</i> (1991), decicated to Grace Okri, the
author's mother, and to Rosemary Clunie, was Okri's literary tour de
force. This Booker Prize winner has been called the classic magical
realist novel of West Africa. The story, a blend of Yoruba myth and
postcolonial postmodernity, is set on the eve of independence of
Nigeria. Its narrator is Azaro, a "spirit-child,'' an <i>abiku</i>, a
famished baby of ambiguous existence, who is destined to die in infancy
and be reborn to the same mother over and over again. Okri describes
Azaro's struggle to resist his fate and to survive with his family
hunger, disease, and violence. He is determined to make his smile. <br>
</p>
      <p>The story is simultaneously situated in
the world of dream, of those waiting to be born, of dead. "&#8220;I grew up
with kids seeing spirits," Okri himself has once said in an interview.
Arazo's spirit-companions are constantly trying to pull him back into
their world. Azaro's father undergoes a series of mythic battles and
his mother keeps the family together with her courage and hard work.
The sinister shaman Madame Koto, whose bar Azaro visits, degenerates
with her corrupt deals. Finally Azaro must choose between pains of
mortality and the land of spirits. The title was taken from a poem by
Wole Soyinka &#8211; "May you never walk / When the road waits, famished."
Although Okri has disagreed with the label of magic realism, parallels
have been drawn between his narrative technique and that of Gabriel
García Márquez's <span style="font-style: italic;">One Hundred Years of Solitude</span>.<br>
      </p>

<p>The narrative structure of <i>Songs of Enchantment </i>(1993), Okri's next novel, was simpler than 
in <i>The Famished Road</i>, but it continued to develop the author's mythical and poetical view of the 
world. <i>An African Elegy </i>(1992) was a collection of poems with the classical themes of love, 
solitude, and death. In response to reports of the Sudanese famine, Okri published in 1993 in 
the <i>Guardian</i> the short story 'A Prayer for the Living' in order to generate funds to donate 
to relief charities. "The hungrier I became, the more I saw them &#8211; my old friends who had died 
before me, clutching on to flies. Now, they feed on the light of the air. And they look at us &#8211; 
the living &#8211; with so much pity and compassion in their eyes."<font size="2"><b> 
</b></font><font size="2"></font></p>
<p><i>Dangerous Love</i> (1996) was about artistic crisis of Omovo, 
familiar from <i>The Landscapes Within. </i>He
has a doomed affair with Ifeyiwa, a married woman. Ifeyiwa's husband is
violent and she dreams of cutting his throat with a knife. Government
officials seize Omovo's painting from an exhibition, he is haunted by
an image of a murdered girl, and he feels afraid of painting. "In
ugliness," Omovo says, "we see ourselves as we never want to." Omovo
resigns from his poorly paid work at an office &#8211; he feels free and
decides never to work in an organization again. Ifeyiwa dies on her way
back to her village. Okri's tenth work of fiction, <i>In Arcadia</i> (2002), was a disappointment to 
Helen Brown from <i>The Independent.</i>. "... <i>In Arcadia</i> reads like the ramblings of a stoned sixth former", she wrote in her review on 20 October, 2002. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Let 
everything you're suffering now give you every reason in the world to master your life and your art. 
Live deeply, fully. Be fearless."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Dangerous 
Love</font></i><font size="2">, 1996</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Okri has become the leading figure of his generation of Nigerian writers, who have largely 
abandoned the social and historical themes of <a href="achebe.htm">Chinua Achebe</a>, and brought 
together modernist narrative strategies and Nigerian oral and literary tradition. He has been the 
recipient of many awards, including the Booker Prize (1991), the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for 
Africa (1987), the<i> Paris Review </i>Aga
Khan prize for fiction, the Chianti Rufino-Antico Fattore International
Literary Prize, and the Premio Grinzane Cavour. He is a former board
member of the Royal Society of Literature, and he has served as a
vice-president of the writers' association English PEN. In 2001 he was
awarded an OBE. Okri lives, works, and writes in London, close to the
Canal in Little Venice. His long-term partner, Rosemary Clunie, is a
painter, and video artist. Okri has been Fellow Commoner in Creative
Arts at Trinity College, Cambridge, 1991-93. He is also schooled in
martial arts. </p>
<p>In January 2003 Okri argued in <i>The Guardian</i>, that the decline
of nations begins with the decline of its writers. "Because writers
represent the unconscious vigour and fighting spirit of a land. Writers
are the very sign of the psychic health of a people: they are the
barometer of the vitality of the spirit of the nation." With his poem,
'Prophecy', Okri joined the world-wide debate on the so-called
"preventive war" against Iraq: "A vision of the broken rose / In an
inferno of oil and blood / Earth in dying clothes / Unleash the hidden
will of God." In addition to such novelists as R.N. Morris, Neil
Gaiman, and Melvin Burgess, Okri has experimented with Twitterfiction,
posting in April 2009 a poem via Twitter.</p>
