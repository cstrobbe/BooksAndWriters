<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->One of the greatest poets of the English
language, best-known for his epic poem <span style="font-style: italic;">Paradise Lost </span>(1667). Milton's powerful, rhetoric prose and the eloquence of his poetry had an immense influence
especially on the 18th-century verse. Besides poems, Milton
published pamphlets defending civil and religious rights.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste </font><br>
<font size="2">Brought death into the world, and all our woe, </font><br>
<font size="2">With loss of Eden." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from <i>Paradise Lost</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>John Milton was born in London. His mother, Sarah Jeffrey, a very religious person, was the daughter of a merchant 
sailor. Milton's father, named John, too, had risen to prosperity as a scrivener or law 
writer <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he also composed madrigasl and psalm settings. The family was wealthy
enough to afford a second house in the country. Milton's first teachers
were his father, from whom he inherited love for art and music, and the
writer Thomas Young, a graduate of St Andrews University. Milton took
part in small domestic consorts, he played often a small organ and he
had "delicate, tuneable voice". At the age of twelve Milton was
admitted to St Paul's School near his home. Five years later he entered
Christ's College, Cambridge. While considering himself destined for the
ministry, he began to write poetry in Latin, Italian, and English. One
of Milton'e earliest works, 'On the Death of a Fair Infant' (1626), was
written after his sister Anne Phillips had suffered from a miscarriage.
'In inventorem bombardae' (On the inventor of gunpowder), a piece in a
series on the occasion of the Gunpowder Plot, contains Milton's first
portrayal of Satan. </p>
<p>Milton did not adjust to university life.  He was called, 
half in scorn, "The Lady of Christ's", and after starting a fist fight with his 
tutor, he was expelled for a term. On leaving Cambridge Milton had given up his original plan to become 
a priest. He adopted no profession but spent six years at leisure in his father's home, writing during 
that time <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Allegro</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Il Penseroso</span> (1632), <span style="font-style: italic;">Comus</span> (1634), and Lycidas (1637), about the meaning of death, 
which was composed after the death of his friend Edward King. Milton wrote in Latin as was usual for the 
time. His first published poem was the sonnet 'An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatic Poet, W. Shakespeare', 
which was printed anonymously in the Second Folio of Shakespeare's works (1632). </p>
<p>In 1635 the Miltons moved to Horton, Buckinghamshire, where John
pursued his studies in Greek, Latin, and Italian. He traveled in France
and Italy in the late 1630s, meeting in Paris the jurist and theologian
Hugo Grotius and the astronomer Galileo Galilei in Florence <font face="Symbol">-</font> there are references to Galileo's telescope in <i>Paradise Lost</i>. His conversation with the famous scientist Milton recorded in his celebrated plea for a free speech and free discussion, <span style="font-style: italic;">Areopagitica</span>
(1644), in which he stated that books "preserve as in a vial the purest
efficacy and extraction of that living intellect bred in them." Milton
returned to London in 1639, and set up a school with his nephews and a
few others as pupils. He had planned to write an epic based on the
Arthurian legends, but then gave up his literary pursuits, partly due
to the Civil War, which divided the country as Oliver Cromwell fought
against the king, Charles I. </p>
<p>Concerned with the Puritan cause, Milton published a series of
pamphlets against episcopacy (1642), on divorce (1643), in defense of
the liberty of the press (1644), and in support of the regicides
(1649). He also served as the secretary for foreign languages in
Cromwell's government. After the death of Charles I, Milton expressed
in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates</span> (1649) the view that the people have the right to depose and punish tyrants. </p>
<p>In 1651 Milton became blind, but like <a href="jlborges.htm">Jorge Luis Borges</a>
centuries later, blindness helped him to stimulate his verbal richness.
"He sacrificed his sight, and then he remembered his first desire, that
of being a poet," Borges wrote in one of his lectures. One of his
assistants was the poet and satirist Andew Marvell (1621-78), who spoke
for him in Parliament, when his political opinions stirred much
controversy. After the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Milton was
arrested as a noted defender of the Commonwealth, but was soon
released. However, for his opposition Milton was forced to pay a
massive fine. Besides public burning of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Eikonoklastes</span> (1649) and the first <span style="font-style: italic;">Defensio</span> (1651) in Paris and Toulouse, Milton escaped from more punishment, but he became a relatively poor man. The manuscript of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
he sold for £5 to Samuel Simmons, and was promised another £5 if the
first edition of 1,300 copies sold out. This was done in 18 months. </p>

<p>Milton was married three times. His first marriage started
unhappily; this experience promted the poet to write his famous essays
on divorce. He had married in 1642 Mary Powell, seventeen at that time.
She grew soon bored with her busy husbandand went back home where she
stayed for three years. Their first child, Anne, was born in 1646. Mary
died in 1652 and four years later Milton married Katherine Woodcock;
she died in 1658. For her memory Milton devoted the sonnet 'To His Late
Wife'. In the 1660s Milton moved with his third wife, Elizabeth
Minshull, again a much younger woman, to what is now Bunhill Row. The
marriage was happy, in spite of the great difference of their ages.
Milton spent in Bunhill Row the remaining years of his life, apart from
a brief visit to Chalfont St Giles in 1665 during a period of plague.
His late poems Milton dictated to his daughter, nephews, friends,
disciples, and paid amanuenses. </p>
<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span>
(1643), composed after Mary had deserter him, Milton argued that a true
marriage was of mind as well as of body, and that the chaste and modest
were more likely to find themselves "chained unnaturally together" in
unsuitable unions than those who had in youth lived loosely and enjoyed
more varied experience. Though Milton morally austere and
conscientious, some of his religious beliefs were very unconventional,
and came in conflict with the official Puritan stand. Milton who did
not believe in the divine birth, "believed perhaps nothing," as Ford
Madox Ford says in <i>The March of Literature</i>
(1938). Milton's depiction of God changes from one work to the next,
but basically he rejected the doctrine, that God the Father, God the
Son and God the Holy Ghost are coessential and coeternal. <br>
 </p>

<p>Milton died on November 8, 1674. He was buried beside his father in
the church of St Giles, Cripplegate. It has been claimed that Milton's
grave was desecrated when the church was undergoing repairs. All the
teeth and "a large quantity of the hair" were taken as souvenirs by
grave robbers. </p>
<p>Milton's achievement in the field of poetry was recognized after the appearance of <i>Paradise Lost</i>.
Before it the writer himself had showed some doubt of the worth of his
work: "By labor and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this
life), joined with the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps
leave something so written to after-times, as they should not willingly
let it die."<font size="2"><b> </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Reason of Church Government</font></i><font size="2">, 1641)</font>
Milton's cosmic vision has occasionally provoked critical discussion.
Even T.S. Eliot has attacked the author and described him as one whose
sensuousness had been "withered by book-learning." Eliot claimed that
Milton's poetry '"could <i>only</i> be an influence for the worse." 
</p>
<p>The theme of Fall and expulsion from Eden had been in Milton's mind
from the 1640s. His ambition was to compose an epic poem to rival the
ancient poets, such as Homer and <a href="virgil.htm">Virgil</a>, whose grand vision in <i>Aeneid </i>left
traces in his work. Originally it was issued in 10 books in 1667, and
in 12 books in the second edition of 1674. Milton, who wanted to be a
great poet, had also cope with the towering figure of Shakespeare, who
had died in 1616 <font face="Symbol">-</font> Milton was seven at that time. In his own hierarchy, Milton placed highest in the scale the epic, below it was the drama. </p>
<p><i>Paradise Lost</i> is not easy to read with its odd syntax,
difficult vocabulary, and complex, but noble style. Moreover, its
cosmic vision is not actually based on the Copernican system,<b> </b>but
more in the traditional Christian cosmology of its day, where the Earth
(and man) is the center of the universe, not the sun. The poem tells a
biblical story of Adam and Eve, with God, and Lucifer (Satan), who is
thrown out of Heaven to corrupt humankind. Satan, the most beautiful of
the angels, is at his most impressive: he wakes up, on a burning lake
in Hell, to find himself surrounded by his stunned followers. He has
been defeated in the War of Heaven. "All is not lost; th' unconquerable
Will, / And study of revenge, immortal hate, / And courage never to
submit or yield... /" Milton created a powerful and sympathetic
portrait of Lucifer. His character bears similarities with
Shakespeare's hero-villains Iago and Macbeth, whose personal ambition
is transformed into metaphysical nihilism. </p>
<p>Milton's view influenced deeply such Romantic poets as <a href="wblake.htm">William Blake</a> and <a href="pshelley.htm">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, who regarded Satan as the real hero of the poem <font face="Symbol">-</font>
a rebel against the tyranny of Heaven. The troubled times, in which
Milton lived, is also seen on his theme of religious conflict. <font size="2"> </font>In <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>
Blake stated that Milton is "a true Poet, and of the Devil's party
without knowing it." Many other works of art have been inspired by <i>Paradise Lost</i>, among them
Joseph Haydn's oratorio <i>The Creation</i>, <a href="apope.htm">Alexander Pope</a>'s <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> and <i>The Dunciad</i>, <a href="jkeats.htm">John Keat</a>'s poem <i>Endymion</i>, <a href="byron.htm">Lord Byron</a>'s <i>The Vision of Judgment</i>, the satanic Sauron in <a href="tolkien.htm">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>'s saga <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
Noteworthy, Nietzsche's Zarathustra has more superficial than real
connections with Milton's Lucifer, although Nietzsche knew Milton's
work. </p>
