<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American mystery writer, whose series character Dr. Basil Willing debuted in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dance of Death</span>
(1938). Willing, the first American psychiatrist detective, believes
that "every criminal leaves psychic fingerprints, and he can't wear
gloves to hide them." He appeared in 12 of McCloys' novels and in
several of her short stories. McCloy often used the theme of
doppelgänger, but offered a psychological or realistic explanation for
the seemingly supernatural events. </p>


<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You enter a room, a street, a country
road. You see a figure ahead of you, solid, three-dimensional, brightly
coloured. Moving and obeying all the laws of optics. Its clothing and
posture is vaguely familiar. You hurry toward the figure for a closer
view. It turns its head and - you are looking at yourself. Or rather a
perfect mirror-image of yourself only - there is no mirror. So, you
know it is your double. And that frightens you, for tradition tells you
that he who sees his own double is about to die..."</b> (from <i>Through a Glass, Darkly</i>, 1950) </font>
</blockquote>

<p>Helen McCloy was born in New York City. Her mother was the writer
Helen Worrell McCloy and father, William McCloy, was the longtime
managing editor of the <i>New York Evening Sun</i>. She was educated
at the Friend's School, run by Brooklyn's Quaker community. In 1923,
she went to France, where she attended in 1923-24 the Sorbonne, Paris.
She then worked for <i>Hearst's Universal News Service</i> (1927-32),  as an art critic for <i>International Studio</i> and other magazines, and free-lance contributor to London <i>Morning Post </i>and <i>Parnassus</i>. McCloy returned to the United States in 1932. </p>
<p>Having read Sherlock Holmes as a young girl, McCloy retained an
interest in mysteries and began to write them in the 1930s. Her her
first novel, <i>Dance of Death</i>, was published in 1933. It was followed by several other crime publications in the 1940s. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cue for Murder&nbsp; </span>(1942)
was a story of murder onstage during a Broadway revival of Sardou's
Fédora. McCloy did not hesitate to touch political issues, as in <span style="font-style: italic;">The One That Got Away</span> (1945), that explored the psychology of Fascism, which she felt was rooted in the hatred of women.  A non-Willing mystery, <span style="font-style: italic;">Panic</span> (1944), was set in a remote cottage in the Catskills and was notable for its use of cryptoanalysis. </p>
<p>McCloy's hero, Dr. Basil Willing, is tall and elegant, comes from
Baltimore, but he had a Russian mother. Willing became interested in
psychiatry when he saw 'shell-shocked' soldiers during his World War I
service. He studied psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, then in Paris and
Vienna, acquiring a thorough knowledge of Freudian psychoanalysis.
Willing's wife was an Austrian refugee, Gisela von Hohenems, who first
appeared in <i>The Man in the Moonlight</i> (1940). Later he is
widowed. Willing lectures at Harvard, acts as an adviser to the New
York district attorney's office, and lives with his daughter, named
Gisela after her mother. Interested in perception and thinking, Willing
is determined to find out how the villiain's perceptions are different
from other people's. </p>
<p>Willing appeared mostly in novels but also first time in the short
story 'Through a Glass, Darkly' which was a retelling of the legend of
the Doppelgänger and was expanded into a novel of the same name in
1950. In 'The Singing Diamonds' Willing investigated reports of flying
saucers; it became the title story of a 1965 collection of works by
Helen McCloy.In  <span style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Splitfoot</span>
(1968), Dr. Willing and his wife to take shelter at a remote house in
New England, where they must lodge in a haunted room. The title refers
to the Devil, but Mr Splitfoot is also a symbol for the two sides of
our nature, as Willing points out. The critic and mystery writer H.R.F.
Keating included the work in 1987 among the 100 best crime and mystery
books ever published.</p>
      <p>Although McCloy was known primarily as a mystery novelist, she
published under the pseudonym Helen Clarkson also a science fiction
story,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Last Day </span>(1959),
regarded as the first really technically well-informed novel on the
subject. It tells about a middle-aged woman, Lois, who witnesses a
nuclear fallout on an isolated island, which in the end gives no
refuge."Is it communism to want peace in a nuclear age?" she asks.
Determined to get the scientific details right, McCloy consulted with
the editors of the <i>Bulletin of Atomic Scientists</i>. 
      </p>

<p>Another masterpiece is the eight Basil Willing novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Through a Glass, Darkly</span>
(1950), a supernatural puzzle in the tradition of Dickson Carr. "If you
want to scare yourself still in bed, it's just the thing for you," the
English writer Pamela Hansford Johnson said of the book. In the story
art teacher Faustina Crayle is dismissed by Mrs Lightfoot from Brereton
School for Girls in mid-term "for the good of the school", but she is
not given a clear explanation. Willing is brought into the case by his
fiancée Gisela, whom Faustina tells about the strange decision. Willing
is told that students have seen Faustina frequently appear in places
where she couldn't possibly be. Mrs Lightfoot has her own theory: "I
was born without faith in religion and I have lost my faith in science.
I don't understand the theories of Messrs Planck and Einstein. But I
grasp enough to realize that the world of matter may be a world of
appearances &#8211; not a world of reality. Everything we see and hear and
touch may be as tricky an illusion as the reflection in a mirror or the
mirage in a desert." Alice Aitchison, the dramatic coach, falls down
the steps, breaks her neck, and Faustina is suspected of causing the
accident. Later Gisela finds Faustina dead in her cottage. The puzzle
is solved without supernatural elements &#8211; behind the mysterious events
is Faustina's distant relative, Vining, a man, who wants her jewels and
has impersonated her. </p>
<p>The double theme was handled also in <span style="font-style: italic;">A Change of Heart</span> (1973). In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Impostor</span>
(1977) a woman, Marina, recovers consciousness after a car crash to
find herself in a psychiatric clinic. She recalls the accident clearly
but she's told that all is her delusion. A man arrives, not her
husband, but the get away she accepts the impostor. McCloy used in the
story a cryptological double bluff. She had read about it in 1944 when
she was writing <i>Panic</i>, but because she was unable to trace the source, she improvised her own version of it.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'We live in a curious culture today.
Everyone wants money and notoriety, but everyone hates the few who
actually get the money and notoriety. They immediately become the
targets of envy and malice. People watch them for the first sign of
weakness the way vultures watch a dying animal. Do you want that?'"</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Impostor</font></i><font size="2">, 1977) </font></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"> The Slayer and the Slain</span>
(1957) dealt with amnesia. The first part is narrated by a young man,
Harry Vaughan, who falls down, and loses part of his memory, about half
an hour. He feels himself ten years older, suffers from headaches,
meets people who know him but he doesn't remember them. He returns to
his native city where he meets Celia, his old sweetheat whom he loves
but who is married to Simon Thrall, and Lex MacLean, his cousin.
Somebody is following his life, a shadow. The narrator receives
anonymous letters. Simon, the husband of Celia, is killed. In the
second part Harry's hidden personality, Henry, reveals himself through
automatic writing. Henry explains that when Celia refused to marry him,
Harry suffered a shock and lived in a haze for ten years. In this life
he was in war and became an university lecturer. Harry suspect that
Henry killed Simon, and also Lex, who started to doubt Harry's sanity.
The books ends in a locked-room mystery: Harry is shot dead in a room,
where all the doors and windows are locked. Two voices was head from
the room before a gun was fired, but only Harry is found. </p>

<p>In 1946, McCloy married Davis Dresser; they had one daughter. Dresser had gained fame with his Mike Shayne novels, 
written under the pseudonym <a href="bhallida.htm">Brett Halliday</a>. With Dresser, she founded  the Torquil Publishing Company 
and a literary agency (Halliday and McCloy). Their marriage ended in 1961. 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Two-Thirds of a Ghost</span> (1956), in which Willing solves the murder of an  
alcoholic bestseller novelist, McCloy deals with the publishing industry &#8211; the suspects include Cottle's agent and 
publisher. The name of the writer, Amos Cottle, was taken from a satirical poem by Lord Byron: 
"And AMOS COTTLE strikes the Lyre in vain. / In him an author's luckless lot behold! 
/ Condemn'd to make the books which once he sold. / Oh, AMOS COTTLE! ..." (<i>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</i>, 1809) </p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, McCloy was a co-author of review column for Connecticut newspapers 
and in 1950 she became the first woman to serve as president of Mystery Writers of America. She 
received in 1953 an Edgar from the same organization for her criticism. McCloy also helped to 
found in 1971 a New England chapter of the Mystery Writers of America in Boston.  
The Helen McCloy/MWA Scholarship for Mystery Writing was founded to nurture talent 
in mystery writing &#8211; in fiction, nonfiction, playwriting, and screenwriting. 
Helen McCloy died in 1994. </p>
