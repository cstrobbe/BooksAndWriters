<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Novelist and short-story writer, one of the
leading intellectuals of the 'Generation of 1870'. Eça de Queirós
introduced naturalism and realism to Portuguese literature. He is
considered the major novelist of his generation. The French writer
Emile Zola admired him greatly and said that Eça was "greater than
Flaubert". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Happiness would arrive one day and to
hasten its arrival I did everything that a good Portuguese and a
constitutionalist could do: I prayed every night to Our Lady of Sorrows
and bought lottery tickets, the cheapest available."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Mandarin</font></i><font size="2">, 1880) </font></blockquote>


<p>José Maria Eça de Queirós was born in Póvoa de Varzim, a small
fishing town. He was the illegitimate son of a prominent Brazilian
judge, Maria de Almeida Teixeira de Queiroz. His mother and grandmother
had moved to Póvoa de Varzim in order to keep the her pregnancy a
secret. Formally Eça de Queirós was not acknowledged by his parents
until he was in his forties. With his father's support he was able to
study at the University of Coimbra. Originally Eça's name was spelled
Queiroz, but after the spelling of Portuguese was standardized with an
agreement with Brazil, the name is now Queiros. </p>
<p>Eça de Queirós was raised by his paternal grandparents, even after
his father had married Carolina Augusta Pereira d'Eca, who was most
likely his mother. At the age of five he was sent to a boarding school
in Oporto. He studied law at the University of Coimbra and after
graduation his father helped him make a start in legal profession. Eça
de Queirós spent most of his life in the consular service. He worked in
the 1870s and 1880s in diplomatic missions in Havana and in Victorian
London. At the age of forty-one, he married Emília de Resende, the
sister of his friend Count Luís Resende. In the late 1880s, Eça de
Queirós founded with others <i>Revista de Portugal</i> which appeared in 1889-92. In 1888, he was appointed consul in Paris, where he served until his death. </p>
<p>In 1871 Eça de Queirós started to publish with Ramalho Origão (1837-1915) a monthly journal, <i>As Farpas</i>,
which satirized Portuguese life. During these years Eça de Queirós
became closely associated with the "Generation of Coimbra". The group
was committed to social and artistic reforms. After the civil war of
1828-1834, Portugal was politically and economically dependent on Great
Britain and culturally dominated by France. Eça and other members of
the group wanted to replace the conventional literary traditions with
literature dealing with the contemporary issues."Over the railroads
that had opened the peninsula," he wrote, "whole waves of new things
descended upon us every day from France, and Germany by way of France:
ideas, aesthetic systems, forms, sentiments, humanitarian concerns." </p>

<p>Eça de Queirós's  work is characterized by ironic tone and social criticism. His best known novel, <i>O Crime do Padre Amaro</i>
(1875), was based on his experiences as a municipal official in the
province of Leiria. The protagonist is a priest, Father Amaro. Eça
follows his life from his youth to middle age, satirizing in his
character clerical corruption and the destructive effects of celibacy.
The story is set in a provincial town, which is described in a harsh
light: "In the row of poor dwellings at the side of the Archway, the
old women sat at their doors, spinning; the dirty, ill-nourished
children played on the ground, showing their nude, swollen bellies; and
the hens went round voraciously picking among the dirt and filth. Round
the fountain all was noise; vessels were dragged over the stones,
servants abused one another, soldiers in dirty uniforms and enormous
laced down-at-heel boots waved their malacca canes and made love; girls
with fat-paunched pitchers on their heads walked in pairs swinging
their hips; two lazy officers, with their uniforms unbuttoned and
hanging loose over their stomachs, chatted together as they waited to
see who might arrive." </p>
<p><i>O Primo Basilio</i> (1878) was a <a href="flaubert.htm">Flaubertian</a> 
study of a middle-class Lisbon family and focused on adultery. The novel has 
been praised for its female characters <font face="Symbol">-</font> the romantic 
and sensual Luiza, who falls in love with her cousin Bazilio; and Luiza's servant, 
Juliana, embittered and virginal, who scorns her. Eça doesn't condemn the 
cheating wife or the blackmailing servant <font face="Symbol">-</font> he shows 
much understanding to human weaknesses as in the character of Father Amaro. 
<i>Os Maias</i> (1880) depicted upper-class life and the degeneration of an old 
Beira family, the Maias, through the love affair between Carlos, the 
grandson of Alfonso de Maia, and Maria Eduarda, who  turns out to be not 
the wife of a wealthy Brazilian, Castro Gomes, but his mistress. The ironic or tragic 
destines of the characters reflect ideological, cultural and political development 
in Portugal from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the mid-1880's. </p>

<p>In 1889-1890 the <i>Revista de Portugal</i> published Eça de Queirós's 
free translation 
of Henry Rider Haggard's imperial romance <i>King Solomon's Mines</i> 
under the title <i>As Minas de Salomão</i>. The translation 
appeared in book form in 1891. Perhaps for political reasons, Eça de Queiró 
toned down in his version  Haggard's critical remarks on the Portuguese presence in 
Africa. </p>

<p>Eça de Queirós's naturalism and attacks on religious hypocrisy and
defects of the elite arose much controversy, and he was called the
"Portuguese <a href="ezola.htm">Zola</a>."  Eça himself loved Balzac and Flaubet, and the France they portrayed, well aware of its fictional nature. In <i>O Mandarim</i>
(1880) Eça de Queirós moved from naturalism toward a new aesthetic form
and gave more space to the interaction between the reality and the free
flight of imagination. "... rest a while from the harsh study of human
reality. Let us depart instead for the fields of Dreams and wander
those blue, romantic hills where stands the abandoned tower of the
Supernatural, where cool mosses clothe the ruins of Idealism. Let us,
in short, indulge in a little fantasy."<b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"></font>  </p>
<p><i>A Relíquia</i> (1887) was a provicative story of religious
hypocrisy and truth. Its writing coincided with his marriage and drew
on the travels with his wife's brother to Egypt and the Near East. The
young Teodorico Raposo is a Christian Bachelor of Law, an opportunist
and an obsessed hunter of women. His wealthy Aunt Titi, whom he tries
to please, is a fetish-loving Catholic. Teodorico hangs on the walls
pictures of saints, "as a gallery of spiritual ancestors from whom I
received a constant example in the difficult path of virtue." He is
sent Jerusalem to acquire a healing relic for his aunt, but lands first
on Alexandria, where he meets the German scholar Topsius, and Mary, an
English whore. Aboard the <i>Shark</i>, bound from Aleksandria to
Jaffa, he has a vision of the Ascension, the Christ, the Devil, and the
furious Auntie with her prayer-book. Teodorico comforts Lucifer: "Never
mind, there will be plenty of pride and dissolution and blood and fury
in the world. Do not regret the holocaust of Moloch. You shall have
holocaust of Jews." In the Holy Land he is transported back in time as
Theodoricus, a Lusitanian, with his companion, Dr. Topsius. He sees
Jesus the Nazareth before the Praetor, and witnesses the crucifixion.
The still-living Jesus is smuggled from the cross into a grave, and
after adventures Teodorico returns back to his own century. Jerusalem,
"the shining citadel of a god", on the eve of the Passover, has become
"sombre, packed with monasteries and crouched behind its crumbling
walls, like a poor, flea ridden woman who crawls into a corner to die,
wrapped in the ragged remnants of her cloak." Instead of the Crown of
Thorns, Teodorico gives accidentally Auntie another souvenier from his
voyage, Mary's night-dress. "One hails Eça de Queiroz, to give him his
true name, as a master who in <i>The Relic</i>
has done the improbable," wrote the American literature critic Harold
Bloom. "He has united Voltaire and Robert Louis Stevenson in a single
body, and given us a general romance that is also a superb satire, a
unique literary triumph." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Genius</font></i><font size="2">, 2002) </font></p>

<p>Eça de Queirós died of tuberculosis in Paris on August 16, 1900. Posthumously appeared<i> A ilustre Casa de Ramires</i>
(1900), a story of a decacent aristocrat, Goncalo Mendes Ramires, the
most genuine and ancient nobleman in Portugal, who writes a historical
novel about his ancestors. <i> A correspondência de Fradique Mendes </i>(1900) was a study of Portugal's past and the simple life in the countryside. In  <i>A Cidade e as Serras </i>(1901)
a rich young man enjoys in Paris from all the pleasures that a modern
society can offer. Eventually his moral crisis leads him back to his
rural surroundings. "Persistently I considered her as a flower of
'Civilisation' <font face="Symbol">-</font> and I thought of the
centuries of toil, refinement and culture that were required to produce
the soil from which such a flower could bud, and then bloom fully..."
Eça de Queirós's romantic early writings, collected under the title <i>Prosas Bárbaras</i> (1903), showed his lyrical and ironic prose style at its best. </p>
