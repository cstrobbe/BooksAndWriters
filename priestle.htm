      <p>British journalist, novelist, playwright, and essayist.
Priestley's output was vast and varied&nbsp;&#8211; he wrote over one hundred
novels, plays, and essays, and is best known as the author of the novel
      <em>The Good Companions</em> (1929). A man of versatility, he was
a patriot, cosmopolitan Yorkshireman, professional amateur, cultured
Philistine, reactionary radical, and a common-sense spokesman for the
ordinary man-in-the-street. Priestley refused both knighthood and
peerage, but accepted in 1977 the prestigious Order of Merit. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I can't help feeling wary when I
hear anything said about the masses. First you take their faces from
'em by calling 'em the masses and then you accuse 'em of not having any
faces."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Saturn Over the Water</font></i><font size="2">, 1961) </font></blockquote>
      <p>J.B. Priestley was born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in the
north of England. His father, Jonathan Priestley, was a prosperous
schoolmaster; his mother died when he was an infant. Priestley attended
Bradford Grammar School, but left his studies at the age of sixteen and
worked as a junior clerk in a firm (1910-1914). In Bradford Priestley
began to write poetry for his own pleasure and contribute articles to
local and London papers.</p>
      <p>During WW I Priestley served with the Duke of Wellington's and
Devon regiments, and survived the front lines in Flanders. He was
wounded several times. In 1917, when he took an officer's commission
and returned to France, he was severely gassed. "I was lucky in that
war," Priestley later said, "and have never ceased to be aware of the
fact." </p>
      <p>From 1919 Priestley studied literature, history and political
science at Bradford and at Cambridge, receiving his B.A. in 1921. From
1922 he worked as a journalist in London, starting his career as an
essayist and critic at various newspapers and periodicals, including
the <i>New Statesman</i>. His first collection of essays, <em>Brief&nbsp;
Diversions</em>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1922.</p>
      <p>Priestley gained international popularity with his novel<i>
The Good Companions</i>, a tale about the adventures of a troop of
traveling players. "To say that these men paid their shillings to watch
twenty-two hirelings kick a ball is merely to say that a violin is wood
and catgut, that Hamlet is so much paper and ink. For a shilling the
Bruddersford United AFC offered you Conflict and Art."<font size="2">
(in </font><i><font size="2">The Good Companions</font></i><font size="2">) </font>It was followed by <em>Angel Pavement</em> (1930),
depicting the people of London and what happens to them when an
adventure comes to them in the person of the mysterious Mr Goldspie. In
the early 1930s, Priestley was Heinemann's most popular novelist. </p>
      <p>As a playwright Priestley started in the 1930s with such
popular comedies as <em>Dangerous Corner</em> (1932), based on the
idea that telling the whole truth is like rounding a corner on two
wheels. It was the first of his 'Time' plays. In <em>Time and the
Conways</em> (1937) Priestley drew his ideas of time from J.W. Dunne's <i>An
Experiment with Time</i> (1927). The third play in the series was<em> I
Have Been Here Before</em>&nbsp; (1937), inspired by theories of P. D.
Ouspensky, and the fourth, <em>An Ispector Calls</em> (1946), was a
detective thriller about the suicide of a young woman and a mysterious
Inspector, who seems to be all-knowing. The play was first produced in
1945 in Moscow, simultaneously in two theatres, and then at the New
Theatre in London during the following year. <em>Laburnum Grove</em>
(1933), produced by J.P. Mitchelhill, owner of the Duchess Theatre, was
an unmasking of hypocrisy behind a façade of respectability. Priestley
also founded his own production company, English Plays, Ltd., and in
1938-39 he was director of the Mask Theatre in London. His financing of
the theatre was interrupted by the war, then Mitchelhill became the
chair of the company. Priestley earned well as a producer, and he
actively reinvested money in the theatre, proving that G.B. Shaw, who
declared that management would ruin him, was quite wrong. Altogether
Priestley wrote about 50 plays. </p>
      <p>Among Priestleys's other books were <em>English Journey</em>
(1934), a seminal work in arousing social conscience in the 1930s; it
also inspired George Orwell's <i>The Road To Wigan Pier</i> (1937),<em>
Literature and Western</em> (1960), a survey of Western literature over
the past 500 years, and his a book of memoirs,<em> Margin Released</em>
(1962). Priestley's novel <em>The Magicians</em> (1954) showed the
influence of the Swiss analytical psychologist <a href="cjung.htm">Carl
Jung</a>. The last of his novels was <em>Found, Lost, Found</em>
(1976), an old-fashioned fairy tale and love story in a modern setting.
      </p>
      <p>After the outbreak of World War II Priestley gained fame as
'the voice of the common people'. He was a patriotic radio broadcaster,
second only to Churchill. Priestley's broadcasts, following the nine
o'clock Home Service news on Sunday nights in 1940, and his 1941 series
'Make it Monday', spread the ideology of the 'people's war': "... we're
fighting not merely to keep the German jack-boot off our necks but also
to put an end once and for all to that world, and to bring into
existence an order of society in which nobody will have far too many
rooms in a house and nobody have far too few." Evelyn Waugh, who made
fun of Priestley, later quoted against him a passage from the thriller <em>Blackout
in Gretley</em> (1942), in which one of the characters suggested, that
the country should take "a firm grip on about fifty thousand important,
influential gentlemanny persons" and tell them firmly "to shut up and
do nothing if they don't want to be put to doing some most unpleasant
work". At the early stage of the Cold War, Priestley became known for
his support for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In 1946-47 he was
a U.K. delegate to UNESCO conferences. </p>
      <p>Priestley married three times, for the first time in 1919 with
Emily &#8220;Pat&#8221; Tempest, who died from cancer in 1925, then with Mary
('Jane') Wyndham Lewis, the former wife of the biographer and satirist
D.B. Wyndham Lewis. In 1953 he married the archaeologist and writer
Jacquetta Hawkes, whom he had met at the UNESCO conference in Mexico
City in 1947. They lived in Warwickshire in Kissing Tree House,
situated near Stratford-upon-Avon. Priestley wrote with her the travel
book <em>Down a Rainbow</em> ( 1955), which was based on a journey in
New Mexico. </p>
      <p>During his career Priestley published over 120 books, usually
light and optimistic in their tone. Priestley wrote &#8211; with his ears
blocked &#8211; every morning, after lunch he took a break, and then
continued after tea for another two to three hours. A number of his
works have been adapted into feature films and TV productions,
Priestley also wrote directly for the screen. <i>The Good Companions</i>
was adapted in 1974 into a London musical, the music and lyrics by
André Previn and Johnny Mercer, starring Judi Dench, John Mills and
Christopher Gable. For the Alfred Hitchcock film <em>Jamaica Inn</em>
(1939) he wrote additional dialogue to beef up Charles Laughton's part
as smuggler Sir Humphrey Pengellan. Laughton had earlier cooperated
with Priestley in the horror&nbsp;comedy <em>The Old Dark House</em>
(1932), based on<em> Benighted</em> (1927). &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Priestley's prolific production continued nearly sixty years.
From the age of 70 to 84 he produced 21 books. Priestley died on August
14, 1984, at his home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Quin Savory, a popular
novelist ruined by his own success in Graham Greene's novel <i>Stamboul
Train</i> (1932), was modelled on Priestley; the author recognized
himself in the character and threatened legal action. Savory has won
his fame for his epic <em>The Great Gay Round</em>, which is half a
million words long and has lots of Cockney dialogue. The affair was
settled when Greene made the changes demanded. Moreover, it was not in
Priestley interest to destroy financially a young author. His portrayal
in the book was less flattering: Greene had suggested that Priestley
was a potential sex-offender. </p>
      <p>As an essayist Priestley wrote for the 'middle brow' audience.
The topics and themes are numerous. In his pamphlet <em>Letter to a
Returning Serviceman</em> (1945) Priestley shared the common sentiment
that Britain was obliged to rebuild after the war along socialist
lines.&nbsp; Concerned by the decision to test a hydrogen bomb at
Christmas Island in 1957 he argued in 'Britain and the Nuclear Bomb'
(1957) for the moral superiority that unilateral nuclear disarmament
would bring. 'Disturbing' (1967) criticized contemporary playwrights
for creating works that sought to 'disturb' a reading public already
disturbed by their own problems, and in <em>Particular Pleasures</em>
(1975) he stated that works of art should meet some need, and not be
evaluated on programmatic grounds. Priestley's highly enjoyable essay
'The Toy Farm' (1929) tried to answer why toys enchant even adults:
"These toys transform you at a stroke into a god, and a happier god
than any who looks down upon our sad muddle. It is, of course, the more
poetical of our activities that are chosen as subjects for these bright
miniatures of the nursery, yet there is so much poetry in the toys
themselves that even if they mirrored in little even the most prosaic
things, they would still be satisfying."</p>
