<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English novelist, story writer,
critic, poet and painter, one of the greatest figures in 20th-century
English literature. Lawrence saw sex and intuition as ways to
undistorted perception of reality and means to respond to the
inhumanity of the industrial culture. From Lawrence's doctrines of
sexual freedom arose obscenity trials, which had a deep effect on the
relationship between literature and society. In 1912 he wrote: "What
the blood feels, and believes, and says, is always true." Lawrence's
life after World War I was marked with continuous and restless
wandering. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The novel is the book of life. In
this sense, the Bible is a great confused novel. You may say, it is
about God. But it is really about man alive. Adam, Eve, Sarai, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Samuel, David, Bath-sheba, Ruth, Esther, Solomon, Job,
Isaiah, Jesus, mark, Judas, Paul, Peter: what is it but man alive, from
start to finish? Man alive, not mere bits. Even the Lord is another man
alive, in a burning bush, throwing the tablets of stone at Moses's
head." </b></font><font size="2">(from 'Why the Novel Matters' in</font><i><font size="2"> D.H. Lawrence: Selected Criticism</font></i><font size="2">,
1956) </font></blockquote>
      <p>David Herbert Lawrence was born in the mining town of
Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, in central England. He was the fourth child
of Arthur John Lawrence, a struggling coal miner who was a heavy
drinker. His mother, Lydia, née Beardsall, was a former schoolteacher,
whose family had fallen in hard times. However, she was greatly
superior in education to her husband. </p>
      <p>Lawrence's childhood was dominated by poverty and friction
between his parents. In a letter from 1910 to the poet Rachel Annand
Taylor he later wrote: "Their marriage life has been one carnal, bloody
fight. I was born hating my father: as early as ever I can remember, I
shivered with horror when he touched me. He was very bad before I was
born." </p>
      <p>Encouraged
by his mother, with whom he had a deep emotional bond and who figures
as Mrs Morel in his first masterpiece,
Lawrence became interested in arts. He was educated at Nottingham High
School, to which he had won a scholarship. He worked as a clerk in a
surgical appliance factory and then four years as a pupil-teacher.
After studies at Nottingham University, Lawrence received his teaching
certificate at 22 and briefly pursued a teaching career at Davidson
Road School in Croydon in South London (1908-1911). Lawrence's mother
died in 1910 <font face="Symbol">-</font> he helped her die by giving
her an overdose of sleeping medicine. This scene was re-created in his
novel <em>Sons and Lovers</em>&nbsp;(1912). </p>
      <p>In 1909 a number of Lawrence's poems were submitted by Jessie
Chambers, his childhood sweetheart, to Ford Madox Ford, who published
them in <i>English Review</i>. While in Nottingham, Lawrence had
regularly vivited the Chambers family at Haggs Farm, and started his
friendship with Jessie. In 1910 Lawrence got engaged to Louie Burrows,
his old friend. The next year, Lawrence started an affair with Alice
Dax, the wife of a chemist. Falling seriously ill with pneumonia,
Lawrence gave up schoolteaching. </p>
      <p>The appearance of his first novel, <em>The White Peacock</em>&nbsp;(1911),
launched Lawrence as a writer at the age of 25. In 1912 he met Frieda
von Richthofen, the professor Ernest Weekly's wife and fell in love
with her. Frieda left her husband and three children, and they eloped
to Bavaria and then continued to Austria, Germany and Italy. In 1913
Lawrence's novel <i>Sons and Lovers</i> appeared. It was based on his
childhood and contains a portrayal of Jessie Chambers, the Miriam in
the novel and called 'Muriel' in early stories. When the book was
rejected by Heinemann, Lawrence wrote to his friend: "Curse the
blasted, jelly-boned swines, the slimy, the belly-wriggling
invertebrates, the miserable sodding rutters, the flaming sods, the
sniveling, dribbling, dithering, palsied, pulse-less lot that make up
England today." </p>
      <p>In 1914 Lawrence married Frieda von Richthofen, and traveled
with her in several countries in the final two decades of his life.
Violent fights become a part of their marriage and sexual bond.
Katherine Mansfield wrote: "I don't know which disgusts one worse <font face="Symbol">-</font> when they are loving and playing with each
other, or when they are roaring at each other and he is pulling out
Frieda's hair and saying 'I'll cut your bloody throat, you bitch.'" </p>
      <p>Lawrence's fourth novel, <em>The Rainbow</em>&nbsp;(1915),
was about two sisters growing up in the north of England. The character
of Ursula Brangwem was partly based on Lawrence's teacher associate in
Nottingham, Loui Burrows. She was Lawrence's first love. The novel was
banned for its alleged obscenity <font face="Symbol">-</font> it used
swear words and talked openly about sex. Lawrence's frankness in
describing sexual relations between men and women upset a great many
people and over 1000 copies of the novel were burned by the examining
magistrate's order. The banning created further difficulties for him in
getting anything published. Also his paintings were confiscated from an
art gallery. John Middleton Mutty and Catherine Mansfield offered
Lawrence their various 'little magazines' for his texts. An important
patron was Lady Ottoline Morrell, wife of a Liberal Member of
Parliament. Through her, Lawrence formed relationships with several
cultural figures, among them Aldous Huxley, E.M. Forster, and Bertrand
Russell, with whom he was later to quarrel bitterly. "Lawrence dislikes
any will except his own, &amp; he doesn't realise the place of will in
the world," Russell said to in a letter to Ottoline. "He seems to think
instinct alone sufficient. I think his meditations on Satan will cure
him on this view." </p>
      <p>During the First World War Lawrence and his wife were unable
to obtain passports and were target of constant harassment from the
authorities. Frieda, a cousin of the legendary "Red Baron" von
Richthofen, was viewed with great suspicion. They were accused of
spying for the Germans and officially expelled from Cornwall in 1917.
The Lawrences were not permitted to emigrate until 1919, when their
years of wandering began. </p>
      <p>Lawrence started to write <em>The Lost Girl</em>&nbsp;(1920)
in Italy. He had settled with Frieda in Gargano. In those days they
were so poor that they could not afford even a newspaper. The novel
dealt with one of Lawrence's favorite subjects <font face="Symbol">-</font>
a girl marries a man of a much lower social status, against the advice
of friends, and finds compensation in his superior warmth and
understanding. "But it needs a certain natural gift to become a loose
woman or a prostitute. If you haven't got the qualities which attract
loose men, what are you to do? Supposing it isn't in your nature to
attract loose and promiscuous men! Why, then you can't be a prostitute,
if you try your head off: nor even a loose woman. Since <i>willing </i>won't
do it. It requires a second party to come to an agreement." <font size="2">(from <i>The Lost Girl</i><i>, </i>1920<i> </i>) </font>Lawrence
dropped the novel for some years and rewrote the story in an old
Sicilian farm-house near Taormina in 1920. </p>
      <p>In the 1920s <a href="ahuxley.htm">Aldous Huxley</a> traveled
with Lawrence in Italy and France. Between 1922 and 1926 he and Frieda
left Italy to live intermittently
in Ceylon, Australia, New Mexico, and Mexico. These years provided
settings for several of Lawrence's novels and stories. In 1924 the New
York socialite Mabel Dodge Luhan gave Lawrence and Frieda the Kiowa
Ranch in Taos, receiving is return the original manuscript of <i>Sons
and Lovers</i>. In an essay called 'New Mexico' (1928) Lawrence wrote
that "New Mexico was the greatest experience from the outside world
that I have ever had." He felt that it liberated him from the present
era of civilization <font face="Symbol">-</font> "a new part of the
soul woke up suddenly, and the old world gave way to a new." After
severe illness in Mexico <font face="Symbol">-</font> Lawrence
contracted malaria <font face="Symbol">-</font> it was discovered that
he was suffering from life-threatening tuberculosis. From 1925 the
Lawrences confined their travels to Europe. 
      </p>
      <p>Lawrence's best known work is <em>Lady Chatterley's Lover</em>,
first published privately in Florence in 1928. It tells of the love
affair between a wealthy, married woman, Constance Chatterley, and a
man who works on her husband's estate. A war wound has left her
husband, Sir Clifford, a mine owner in Derbyshire, impotent and
paralyzed. Constance has a brief affair with a young playwright and
then enters into a passionate relationship with Sir Clifford's
gamekeeper, Oliver Melloers. Connie becomes pregnant. Sir Clifford
refuses to give a divorce and the lovers wait for better time when they
could be united. "Necessary, forever necessary, to burn out false
shames and smelt the heaviest ore of the body into purity." <font face="Symbol">-</font> One of the models for the cuckolder-gamekeeper
was Angelino Ravagli, who received half the Lawrence estate after
Frieda's death. </p>
      <p><i>Lady Chatterley's Lover </i>was banned for a time in both
the UK and the US as pornographic. In the UK it was published in
unexpurgated form in 1960 after an obscenity trial, where defense
witnesses included E.M. Forster, Helen Gardner, and Richard Hoggart. </p>
      <p>Among Lawrence's other famous novels is <em>Women in&nbsp;Love</em>&nbsp;(1920),
a sequel to <i>Rainbow. </i>The characters are probably partially
based on Lawrence and his wife, and John Middleton Murray and his wife
Katherine Mansfield. The friends shared a house in England in 1914-15.
Lawrence used the English composer and songwriter Philip Heseltine as
the basis for Julius Halliday, who never forgave it. When a manuscript
of philosophical essays by Lawrence fell into Heseltine's hands <font face="Symbol">-</font> no other copies of the text existed <font face="Symbol">-</font> he used it as toilet tissue. According to an
anecdote, Lawrence never trusted the opinions of Murray and when Murray
told that he believed that there was no God, Lawrence replied, "Now I
know there is." </p>
      <p>Lawrence argued that instincts and intuitions are more
important than the reason. "Instinct makes me run from little
over-earnest ladies; instinct makes me sniff the lime blossom and reach
for the darkest cherry. But it is intuition which makes me feel the
uncanny glassiness of the lake this afternoon, the sulkiness of the
mountains, the vividness of near green in thunder-sun, the young man in
bright blue trousers lightly tossing the grass from the scythe, the
elderly man in a boater stiffly shoving his scythe strokes, both of
them sweating in the silence of the intense light."<font size="2"><b> </b>(from
'Insouciance', 1928) </font>Lawrence's belief in the importance of
instincts reflected the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche, whom Lawrence
had read already in the 1910s.<em> Aaron's Road</em>&nbsp; (1922) shows
directly the influence of the German philosopher, and in <em>Kangaroo</em>
(1923) Lawrence expressed his own idea of a 'superman'. </p>
      <p><em>The Plumed Serpent</em>&nbsp;(1926) was a vivid evocation
of Mexico and its ancient Aztec religion. Lawrence's last major work of
fiction,<em> The Man Who Died</em>&nbsp;(1929), originally entitled <i>The
Escaped Cock</i>, was published in two parts, the first in 1928 and the
second in 1929. The bold story of Christ's life following his
resurrection, was written in a New Testament pastiche language. Instead
of going to heaven, Christ initiates himself into the fully human
world, and becomes seduced by the perfume of the priestess of Isis.
Lawrence's non-fiction works include <span class="st"><em>Movements in
European History</em><strong> </strong></span>
(1921), <span class="st"><em>Psychoanalysis And The Unconscious</em><strong>
      </strong></span>(1922),&nbsp;<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Studies
in Classic American Literature</em></span></span> (1923) and <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Apocalypse and the Writings on
Revelation</em></span></span> (1931). </p>
      <p>D.H. Lawrence died at Villa Robermond, in Vence, France on
March 2, 1930, in the company of Frieda, her youngest daughter Barby,
and Maria Huxley. Before his death, he had read a biography of
Columbus. "Then we buried him, very simply, like a bird we put him
away, a few of us who loved him. We put flowers into his grave and all
I said was: "Good-bye, Lorenzo,"" Frieda later recalled. She&nbsp;
moved to the Kiowa Ranch and built a small memorial chapel to Lawrence;
his ashes lie there. In 1950 she married Angelino Ravagli, a former
Italian infantry officer, with whom she had started an affair in 1925.
Jake Zeitlin, a Los Angeles bookseller, who first took care of
Lawrence's literary estate, summarized his feeling when he first saw
the author's manuscripts: "That night when I first opened the trunk
containing the manuscripts of Lawrence and as I looked through them,
watched unfold the immense pattern of his vision and the tremendous
product of his energy, there stirred in me an emotion similar to that I
felt when first viewing the heavens with a telescope." Lawrence also
gained posthumous renown for his expressionistic paintings completed in
the 1920s. </p>
