<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French dramatist, master of short
story,
and historian, who had an office as a state archeologist. Mérimée's
most famous work is the novella <em>Carmen</em> (1845), a story about
jealousy and unfaithfulness. It inspired Georges Bizet's world famous
Opéra-Comique version from 1875. Some 50 movie adaptations have been
made from the story, several of which are filmings of the opera. Along
with Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Vigny, Musset, Gautier, and George Sand,
Mérimée was one of the greatest names of the romantic movement in
France. Passionate, destructive love was Mérimée's subject in many of
his short stories, among them the symbolic 'The Pearl of Toledo'.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Who can say whether the sun is
most beautiful at dawn or at dusk? Who can tell whether the olive tree
or the almond is the more beautiful? Who can tell whether Andalusia or
Valencia breeds the bravest knight? What man can say who is the fairest
of women? But I will tell you who is the fairest. She is Aurora de
Vega, the Pearl of Toledo." </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>In the story the Moorish and Christian world fight about a
woman. Swarthy Suzani challenges Don Guttiera to meet him in single
combat about the Pearl of Toledo. "As mine I will bear her away, or by
Allah, Cordova shall see me no more." Don Guttiera stops his game of
chess and goes for the game of lances. She rides after him and finds
Suzani laying badly wounded near the fountain of Almami. She is willing
to help him when he begs her to take the lance from his chest. She
trustingly approaches Suzani, but he kills her with his saber. </p>
      <p>Prosper Mérimée was born in Paris, the son of Léonor Mérimée,
an artist, and Anne Mérimée. He received law degree from the University
of Paris in 1823, but he also studied Greek, Spanish, English, and
Russian languages and their literature. Between 1826 and 1868 Mérimée
made eighteen trips to England. Due to his interest in the Slavs,
Mérimée also traveled widely in eastern Europe and Russia, and was the
first interpreter of Russian literature in France. Because travelling
was very difficult and costly at that time, he decided to describe the
journey first in his book and then spent his royalties in verifying the
accuracy of his observations. The work,<em>&nbsp;<span class="st">La
Guzla, ou choix de poésies illyriques, recueillies dans la Dalmatie, la
Bosnie, la Croatie et l'Herzégovine</span></em> (1827), was a great
success. In 1830 he visited Spain, which became one of his principal
literary sources. After a career under the ministries of navy,
commerce, and the interior, he was appointed in 1833 inspector-general
of historical remains in France. </p>
      <p>Mérimée made his début as a dramatist at the age of 19 with<em>
Cromwell</em> (1822). <em>Théâtre de Clara Gazul</em><strong> </strong>(1825,
1830) were plays which he passed off as having been written by a
Spanish actress, Clara Gazul. <i>La Guzla</i> was another literary
practical joke, alleged to be translations of "Illyrian" national
songs. Goethe, who eceived a signed copy in his own name, grew
suspicious of its authenticity, and revealed the identity of the
author. Alexandr Pushkin translated the book into Russian and published
a substantial part of it for his <i>Songs of the Western Slavs </i>(1834).
Through a mutual friend, Mérimée sought to make amends with Pushkin,
saying "I am proud and ashamed at the same time to have taken him in."
This incident was a prelude to Mérimée's serious interest Pushkin.
"Comme il insiste peu!" said Mérimée of his light touch. On the other
hand, it is possible that Pushkin, who had a wide knowledge of French
literature, may have read Mérimée's tales. </p>
      <p>Mérimée's historical play,<em><strong> </strong>La Jacquerie</em><strong>
      </strong>(1828, Peasant Revolt), and the&nbsp;novel <span class="st"><em>Chronique du règne de Charles IX</em></span> (1929, A
Chronicle of the Reign of Charles IX), were born in the vogue of
historical fiction established by <a href="wscott.htm">Sir
Walter Scott</a>. In 1831 Mérimée began a long correspondence with a
young girl Jenny Dacquin, which was published as&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Lettres
à une inconnue</em>&nbsp;</span>(1873). With the writer <a href="gsand.htm">George Sand</a> he had a brief
affair,&nbsp;giving&nbsp;a fictionalized account of&nbsp;their
thyst&nbsp; in<em> La Double Méprise</em> (1833, The Double Mistake).
The affair lasted but a week. "I had&nbsp;Mérimée last night, and it
wasn't much," Sand said according to&nbsp; Alexandre <em></em>Dumas.
Henry James wrote that "I have been told that very&nbsp;early one cold
Winter morning he perceived&nbsp;her, with a handkerchief on her head,
lightning the fire to resume her literary tasks. He also, it appears,
had nerves; the&nbsp;spectacle disturbed them&nbsp;&#8211; he himself was not
thinking of getting about his labors yet awhile&nbsp;&#8211; and from that
moment the intimacy ceased." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Mérimée's friends included Stendhal and Turgenev. Goncourt
brothers disliked him, Thomas Carlyle descibed him as "smooth but
utterly barren man", and Victor Hugo criticized his political
loyalties. "As soon as you saw him, you sensed in him a chilliness,"
wrote Hippolyte Taine of Mérimée. "Especially on ceremonial occasions
his features were quite impassive. Even in private, when he was telling
some ridiculous story, his voice remained monotonous, utterly calm,
without brilliance or vivacity..." On the other hand, the Russian
writer Turgenev saw, that "behind the external show of indifference and
coldness, he concealed the most affectionate of hearts..." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"'Ha! ha! you're jealous!' she
retorted, 'so much the worse for you. How can you be such a fool as
that? Don't you see I must love you, because I have never asked you for
money?'</b></font><b><font size="2">"</font></b><font size="2"> (in <i>Carmen</i>)
        </font></blockquote>
      <p><i>Carmen</i>, a novella about Spanish Gypsy life, was first
published serially in <i>La Revue des Deux Mondes</i> in 1845, purpoting to be non-fiction, and two
years lated in an expanded book form. The work was not an immediate success, but
considered in its time immoral. <i>Carmen</i>, inspired by <i>Manon
Lescaut</i> (1731), Abbé Prévost's tale about <i>amor fou</i>, is a
story within a story. Much of its Gypsy lore was derived from the work
of the author, translator, linguist and traveler George Borrow
(1803-1881), but in <i>A Chronicle of the Reign of Charles IX</i>
Mérimée had also a Gypsy character, named Mila. The narrator tells how
he befriended the bandit Don José.<b> "</b>I had no doubt that the man
I was dealing with was a smuggler, or perhaps a robber. But what odds
was it to me? I knew the Spanish character well enough to be quite
certain that I had nothing to fear from a man who had shared food and
tobacco with me. His very presence was a guarantee of protection,
should we run into any troubles." </p>
      <p>When the narrator has met the dangerous gypsy of the title,
Don José rescues him. Months later Don José is arrested and sentenced
to death. He tells that as a corporal in the Spanish cavalry, he was
ordered to arrest Carmen, a flirtatious Gypsy woman, for assaulting a
coworker. José, who fells in love with Carmen, allows her to escape. He
deserts the army, and takes up a life as a robber in the mountains of
Andalusia. The smuggling band also includes Carmen's husband, Garcia le
Borgne, whom José kills. Unfaithful Carmen becomes interested in Lucas,
a picador and makes José insanely jealous. When she refuses to change,
he kills her with a knife &#8211; she doesn't attempt to flee. The murder has
no witnesses, José buries the body, and surrenders himself to the
authorities. The last chapter deals with bohemian customs and language
and was added in 1847 to the novella. </p>
      
      <p>Georges Bizet's (1838-75) opera based on the story is
considered the composer's greatest achievement. Its famous tunes include 'Toreador's Song,' the 'Habanera,' the 'Seguidilla,'
the 'Card Song,' the 'Urchins' Chorus,' and the 'Flower Song'. The
opera premiered at the (second) Salle Favart, the home of Paris'
Opéra-Comique, on 3 March, 1875. As it is well know, the
work had a
disastrous reception: "To keep the public peace and ensure the safety
of the impressionable dragoons and toreadors who surround this woman,"
said Oscar Comettant in <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Siécle</span>,
"she would need to be gagged, her unbridled hip-swaying brought to an
end by tying her into a straitjacket after she had had a pan of water
poured over her head." <span style="font-style: italic;">Carmen</span>'s failure hastened Bizet's early death. He died of a heart attack three months after the premiere, believing his work <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> to be just one more failure. <br>
 </p>

      <p>When the daughter of Mérimée's friend, Countess of Montijo,
became empress Eugénie of France, Merimée was admitted to the royal
circle and made a senator in 1853. Mérimée's disreputable friends
included Count Libri, Guglielmo Bruto Icilio Timoleone, one of the most
accomplished book thieves of all time. Libri was forced to escape with
his wife to England, but a host of politicians, artists, and writers
defended him against accusations. In 1848 Mérimée wrote that "for me,
who has always said that the love of collecting leads people to crime,
Libri is the most honest of collectors, and I know of no man except
Libri who would return to the libraries the books that others have
stolen." Two years after Libri had been found guilty, Mérimée published
in <i>La Revue des Deux Mondes</i> such a loud defence of his friend
that the court ordered him to appear before it, accused of contempt. </p>
      <p>Mérimée also wrote novels and short fiction, archaeological
and historical dissertations, and travel books. <em>Colomba</em>
(1840) was a story of revenge,&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>La Vénus d'Ille</em></span>
(1837) and <em>Lokis</em>, written in 1869, had fantastic elements.
Mérimée died in Cannes on September 23, 1870. Three years later Bizet
finished his opera based on the story. Its rehearsals were constantly
delayed, partly because the theatre's management were nervous of an
opera in which the heroine dies. Members of the chorus decided that
their part was physically impossible &#8211; they had to move and act as well
as sing. <i>Carmen </i>opened on March 3, 1875. The first performance
was a catastrophe &#8211; the audience expected to see a comic opera. Bizet's
adversities did not stop on the second night when the audience was
enthusiastic; the reviews were bad. Though the play staggered on for 48
performances, it never had a full house. However, in Vienna and
elsewhere it was well received. </p>
