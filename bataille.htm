<p>French essayist, philosophical theorist and novelist, often
called the "metaphysician of evil." Bataille was interested in sex,
death, degradation, and the power and potential of the obscene. He
rejected traditional literature and considered that the ultimate aim of
all intellectual, artistic, or religious activity should be the
annihilation of the rational individual in a violent, transcendental
act of communion. <a href="rbarthes.htm">Roland Barthes</a>, Julia
Kristeva, and Philippe Sollers have all written enthusiastically about
his work. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Blameless, shameless. The more
desperate the eroticism, the more hopelessly women show off their heavy
breasts, opening their mouths and screaming out, the greater the
attraction. In contrast, a promise of light awaits at the limits of the
mystical outlook. I find this unbearable and soon returned to insolence
and erotic vomit - which doesn't respect anybody or anything. How sweet
to enter filthy night and proudly wrap myself in it. The whore I went
with was as uncomplicated as a child and she hardly talked. There was
another one, who came crashing down from a tabletop - sweet, shy,
heartbreakingly tender, as I watched her with drunken, unfeeling eyes."</b>
</font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Guilty</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>Georges Bataille was born in Billon, Puy-de-Dôme, in central
France. "I belong to a turbulent generation, born to literary life in
the tumult of surrealism," Bataille once defined his background. His
childhood was a nightmare, or at least we can conclude that with some
certainty from his autobiographical piece in the novel <i> Story of
the Eye</i> (1928).
Bataille's mother, Marie-Antoinette, attempted suicide several times,
but none of her desperate acts succeeded. Bataille loved his father,
Joseph-Aristide, who suffered from general paralysis due to syphilis.
In 1913 he went mad and died three years later. "What upset me more was
seeing my father shit a great number of times . . . ", Bataille later
wrote. At the age of fifteen Bataille left school for a period; until
then he had not been a good student, but after taking up studies at a
boy's school in Épernay on the Marne, he completed the first part of
his <i>baccalauréat</i>. On the eve of World War I, Bataille converted
to Catholicism. In 1916-17 he served in the army, but was discharged
because of tuberculosis. Ill health and bouts of depression troubled
Bataille all his life. </p>
<p>In 1917 Bataille joined the seminary at Saint-Fleur with the
intention of becoming a priest. He spent a period with the Benedictine
congregation at Quarr, on the Isle of Wright. A few years later
Bataille experienced a loss of faith. From 1918 to 1922 he studied at
the École des Chartres in Paris. His thesis dealt with thirteenth
century verse. In 1922 he received a fellowship at the School of
Advanced Hispanic Studies in Madrid. </p>
<p>In the 1920 Bataille was involved with the Surrealist
movement, but he called himself the "enemy from within." He was
officially excommunicated from its inner circles by André Breton, who
accused him of splintering the group. In the same decade, after a
liberating period of psychoanalysis, Bataille started to write. He
founded and edited many journals and was the first to publish such
thinkers as Barthes, Foucault and Derrida. Between 1929 and 1931
Bataille edited the journal<i> Documents</i> (1929-31), which was
devoted to cultural phenomena. With Pierre Klossowski, the brother of
the painter Balthus, Bataille befriended in 1934; they shared a similar
interest in psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and Marquis de Sade. In 1935
Bataille co-founded with <a href="abreton.htm">André Breton</a> the
anti-Fascist group Contre-Attaque. To explore the manifestation of the
sacred in society he, in 1939, co-founded with Michel Leiris and Roger
Caillois the short-lived Collège de Sociologie. It was closely
associated with a secret society which published the<i> Acéphale</i>
review. </p>
<p>Between the years 1922 and 1944, Bataille was a librarian and
a deputy keeper at Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. In the evenings
Bataille changed his role and became known as a regular visitor of
bordellos. This habit caused him troubles at work. He resigned in 1944
because of tuberculosis, two years earlier he had moved to Vézelay,
where he was eventually to be buried. During the Occupation Bataille
traveled restlessly between Paris and provincial France, and produced
some of his major essays, including<i> L'Éxpérience intérieure</i>
(1943), <i>Le Coupable</i> (1944), and <i>Sur Nietzsche</i> (1945).
In 1946 he founded one of the most respected scholarly journals in
France, <i>Critique</i>. </p>
<p>After the war Bataille was unemployed for a long time and his
financial situation was rapaidly going downhill. In 1947 he lectured at
the Collegè Philosophique and edited a series of books for the
publishers Minuit. From 1949 to 1951 he worked as a librarian in
Carpentras in Provence, and from 1951 in Orléans. In 1961 Pablo
Picasso, Max Ernst and Juan Miro arranged an auction of paintings to
help him in his difficulties. Bataille died in Paris on July 8, 1962.
At that time he was ready to return back to the Bibliothèque Nationale.
</p>
<p><i>The Tears of Eros</i> (1961) was Bataille's final book, an
excursion in the history of eroticism and violence from the Aurignacian
era to modern times. Bataille started to write it in 1959, but his
declining physical strength, lapses in memory, and the arrest of his
eldest daughter for her political activities for Algeria slowed down
the work. In its foreword Bataille confessed: "In the violence of
overcoming, in the disorder of my laughter and my sobbing, in the
excess of raptures that shatter me, I seize on the similarity between a
horror and a voluptuousness that goes beyond me, between an ultimate
pain and an unbearable joy!" In the last chapter he wrote about the
Chinese torture and presented photographs of an ecstatic man who is cut
to hundred pieces. The strange, exalted facial expression of the man
fascinated Bataille: "I have never stopped being obsessed by the image
of this pain," he said. <a href="malraux.htm">André Malraux</a>, who
was Minister of State for Cultural Affairs, condemned the book. </p>
<p>Bataille was twice married, first with the actress Silvia
Maklès; they divorced in 1934. Among Silvia's credits were roles in
films by Renoir and Carné. She also played in Renoir's <i>Une partie
de compagne</i> (1936), in which Bataille appeared as a country priest.
Later Silvia married the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Bataille
also had a liaison with "Laurie" (Colette Peignot, who died in 1938).
In 1946 Bataille married Diane de Beauharnais; they had one daughter. </p>
<p><i>Histoire de l'oeil</i> (1928, Story of the Eye), <i>Le
Bleu du ciel </i>(1945, Blue of Noon), and <i>L'abbé C</i> (1950, The
Abbot C.) are among Bataille's best-known glorifications of eroticism.
He felt that sexual union causes a momentary indistinguishability
between otherwise distinct objects. The secret of eroticism opened
visions into unknowable continuity of being, the death. Poetry has
similar dimensions when it dissolves the reader "into the strange."
Pornography was for Bataille the vehicle for his own surrealist
experiments and memory &#8211; this also partly explains complex associations
of eggs and eyes. </p>
<p><i>Story of the Eye</i>, a classic of erotic literature, was
written in 1928 under the pseudonym Lord Auch. It told a tale of a
young couple, Simone and the narrator, who explore the boundaries of
sexual taboos. They play with eggs, milk and all bodily fluids. During
a champagne orgy, their friend Marcelle is left in a wardrobe. She
becomes traumatized and is taken to a sanatorium. After she is brought
back she hangs herself in the same wardrobe. Simone and 'the Cardinal',
the narrator, escape to Spain, where their sexual fantasies become more
blasphemous. "I was not even satisfied with the usual debauchery,
because the only thing it dirties is debauchery itself, while, in some
way or other, anything sublime and perfectly pure is left intact by it.
My kind of debauchery soils not only my body and my thoughts, but also
anything I may conceive in its course, that is to say, the vast starry
universe, which merely serves as a backdrop." In one scene of the book
the heroine strangles her partner to force sexual arousal on him. Later
the Japanese director Nagisa Oshima used similar climax in his
ritualistic film <i>In the Realm of the Senses</i> (1976), which was
based on an actual criminal case in the 1930s Japan. <i>Story of the
Eye</i> has enjoyed a cult status. Most recently it was rediscovered by
the Icelandic pop singer Björk Guðdmundsdóttir.</p>
<p><i>Blue of Noon</i> was set against the backdrop of General
Strike in Spain and nascent German Nazism. The protagonist, Troppmann,
sways between two women, Lazare, a young Communist, and Dorothea or
'Dirty.' Troppmann is almost always drunk, he is a manic, nihilist
dreamer. Eventually he leaves Germany with Dorothea, they copulate in a
graveyard and watch a band of Hitler Youth playing marching songs. Eyes
appear again in the text: "My eyes were no longer lost among the stars
that were shining above me actually, but in the blue of the noon sky. I
shut them so as to lose myself in that bright blueness." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The actions of religious sacrifice
and of erotic fusion, in which the subject seeks to be 'loosed from its
relatedness to the I' and to make room for re-established 'continuity
of Being', are exemplary for him. Bataille, too, pursues the traces of
a primordial force that could heal the discontinuity or rift between
the rationally disciplined world of work and the outlawed other of
reason. He imagines this overpowering return to a lost continuity as
the eruption of elements opposed to reason, as a breathtaking act of
self-de-limiting. In this process of dissolution, the monadically
closed-off subjectivity of self-assertive and mutually objectifying
individuals is dispossessed and cast down into the abyss."</b></font><font size="2"> (Jürgen Habermas in </font><i><font size="2">Philosophical
Discourse of Modernity</font></i><font size="2">,
1987) </font></blockquote>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche's work influenced Bataille deeply, and
such figures as Sade and Gilles de Rais. The latter was a 15th-century
serial killer whose victims were young children. Bataille's views about
social organization were influenced by anthropologist Marcel Mauss' <i>The
Gift</i>. In <i>La part maudite</i> (1949) he dealt with the
phenomenon of waste in nature and society. Although Bataille could
write clearly he was many times content to present his ideas in a
puzzling way. As in the novels of Henry Miller, obscenity functioned as
a techique to break away from language and culture of the bourgeois
society. </p>
