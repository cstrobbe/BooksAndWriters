<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Rabbi and author whose novels depict the
life and culture of Orthodox Jews. Besides novels, Chaim Potok wrote
scholarly and popular articles and reviews throughout his publishing
career. Central theme in his work was the tensions between Judaism and
the values and culture of modern society. Potok's best known works
include <i>The Chosen</i> (1967), <i>The Promise </i>(1969) &#8211; both
became bestsellers &#8211; and <i>My Name Is Asher Lev</i> (1972), which is
considered his finest novel. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"Reuven, as you grow older you
will
discover that the most important things that will happen to you will
often come as a result of silly things, as you call them &#8211; 'ordinary
things' is a better expression. That is the way the world is."' </b>(from
<i>The Chosen</i>, 1967) </font></blockquote>
<p>Herman Harold Potok was born in New York City in Bronx, the
eldest son of Jewish immigrants from Poland. Following traditions,
Potok's parents also gave him a Hebrew name, Chaim Tvzi (Chaim means
"life" or "alive"). His father, Benjamin Max Potok, was a jeweler and
watchmaker. As a child, Potok received primary education in Jewish
schools, where he studied required secular subjects but also the
Talmud, the center of the curriculum. His father wanted him to be a
rabbi. However, by 1950 Potok had come to the conclusion, that he did
not want to live in a Hasidic community. "It wrenched my world
entirely. I lost all of my friends, I lost most of my teachers, I had
to literally reconstruct my existence," he later said in an interview.
"My mother was sympathetic; my father, I don't think he could get over
it till the day he died." (<i><font size="2">Conversations With Chaim
Potok,</font></i><font size="2"> ed. by Daniel Walden, 2001)</font>
Potok's upbringing, Orthodox if not quite Hasidic, were inspiration for
several of his novels, set in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn
and the Bronx. </p>
<p>Because drawing and painting was considered in the Orthodox
community a violation of the Second Commandment and a waste of time,
Potok focused on writing. He read works by James Joyce, Ernest
Hemingway, William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, and other major writers.
Especially Evelyn Waugh's novel <i>Brideshead Revisited </i>(1945)
impressed him deeply. However, Potok also paited for a period during
his school years, but then switched to literature. When he settled with
his family in Philadelphia in an old Victorian home in Merion, he
resumed painting and drawing. </p>
<p>Potok received his M.A. in Hebrew literature, after education
at the
Talmudic Academy High School of Yeshiva University in Washington
Heights, Manhattan, and the Jewish Theological Seminary. At the age of
25, he was ordained a Conservative rabbi. While at Camp Ramah in the
Poconos in 1952, he met Adena Sara Mosevitzsky; they were both
councellors there. After their marriage in 1958, the couple settled in
Los Angeles, where Potok headed the local Camp Ramah organzation and
taught at the University of Judaism. Two years later they moved to
Philadelphia. Between the years 1955 and 1957, Potok served a chaplain
with the US Army, more than fifteen months of his service being in
Korea with a front-line medical battalion and an engineering combat
battalion. This experience provided material for Potok's novels <span style="font-style: italic;">The Book of Lights</span> (1981) and <span style="font-style: italic;">I Am the Clay</span> (1992). </p>
<p> After the birth of his first child, Rosa in 1962, Potok took
his family to Israel for a year. In 1964, he was appointed the managing
editor of the magazine <i>Conservative Judaism</i>, and then
editor-in-chief of the Jewish Publication Society in Philadelphia.
Potok was also chairman of its publication committee. From 1974, he
worked as a special projects editor. Potok received his Ph.D. from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1965. His philosophical dissertation
entitled 'The Rationalism and Skepticism of Solomon Maimon'. With the
exception of the first pages, it dealt with epistemology. In <i>The
Chosen</i>,
Potok took up again this eighteenth century thinker in a scene: "All
right, my father said I see you want me to continue my story. I am
going to tell you another story, also a true story, about a Jewish boy
who lived in Poland. ... He had a great mind but it never left him
peace. He wandered from city to city, never finding roots anywhere,
never satisfied, and finally died at forty-seven on the estate of a
kind-hearted Christian who had befriended him. ..." </p>
<p>In 1983, Potok was visiting Professor of Philosophy at the
University of Pennsylvania, and in 1985 Bryn Mawr College,
Pennsylvania. Potok died of brain cancer on July 23, in his home in
Merion, Pennsylvania. He had been ill with cancer for some time. Adena
Potok, who worked as a psychiatric social worker and teacher, was also
Potok's first reader on a daily basis. When <i>The Chosen</i> was
adapted for the stage at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia, she acted
as the artistic and cultural consultant. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"How the world drinks our blood,"
Reb Saunders said. "How the world makes us suffer. It is the will of
God. We must accept the will of God." He was silent for a long moment.
Then he raised his eyes and said softly, "Master of the Universe, how
do you permit such a thing to happen?"'</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Chosen</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Potok made his debut as a novelist with <i>The Chosen</i>, a
story
about rivalry and friendship between a progressive Orthodox Jewish
scholar and a young Hasid &#8211; Reuven Malther, the secular Jew, and Danny
Saunders, from a Hasidic family. Danny's father Reb is a tzaddik
(Hebrew
for "righteous one"), a spiritual leader of a Hasidic community. He
expects that Danny, who is the elder son, succeeds him. Although the
book was not a critical success, and it was peppered with Yiddish
terms, it became a best-seller, which was a surprise for the author. "I
thought 500 people might be interested in reading this story about two
Jewish kids," Potok said. The success of film version of the book,
directed by Jeremy Kagan and starring Rod Steiger as Reb Saunders,
brought increasing critical interest in Potok's fiction. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Chosen</span> stayed on the<i>
New York Times</i> best-seller list for more than six months and was
nominated for a National Book Award. Two years later published <i>The
Promise</i> follows the same characters. Danny's secular studies and
faith with Freudian psychology has lured him away from the faith of his
father. The book was a Literary Guild Choise in America and achieved a
first printing of 100 000 copies. <i>The Chosen</i> also had a brief
run as an off-Broadway musical in 1988; it was a failure which was
closed after a week. Theodore Bikel played the role of Reb Saunders in
Aaron Posner's stage adaptation from 1999. "The adaptation . . . is
proof that when it comes theater, smaller is often better," said Neil
Genzlinger in the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span>.
<br>
</p>
<p>With <i>My Name Is Asher Lev</i> Potok returned to the
subject of Hasidic religious experience. The novel told of a young
artist, whose choice of career is not approved by his family. However,
he produces two great crucifixions, ultimate symbols of suffering, but
depicting his own mother on the cross. "My name is Asher Lev, <i>the </i>Asher
Lev, about whom you have read in newspapers and magazines, about whom
you talk so much at your dinner affairs and cocktail parties, the
notorious and legendary Lev of the <i>Brooklyn Crucifixion</i>." This
blasphemy leads to his being sent into exile in Paris by his father's
sect. Asher's father is a fundamentalist Jew, and describing the roots
of his art, Asher says: "I call that ambiguity. Riddles, puzzles,
double meanings, lost possibilities, the dark side to the light, the
light side to darkness, different perspectives on the same things.
Nothing in this whole world has only one side to it. Everything is like
a kaleidoscope. That's what I'm trying to capture in my art. That's
what I mean by ambiguity." His father answers: "No one is a
kaleidoscope, Asher. God is not a kaleidoscope. God is not ambiguous.
Our faith in Him is not ambiguous. From ambiguity I would not derive
the strength to do all the things I must do. Ambiguity is darkness.
Certainty is light. Darkness is the world of the Other Side." </p>
<p>The sequel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gift of
Asher Lev</span>, came out in 1990. Lev is now a world-renowned author
living in Paris. He is called back to Brooklyn, and once again forced
to make a choice between the worldly and the sacred. Potok's eighth
novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> I Am the Clay</span>, was set
in Korea. The hero is a wounded orphaned boy who struggles with an old
peasant couple to survive in the war-torn land. Potok took the title of
the book from a Christian hymn, which the peasant woman's mother had
learned from missionaries: "Have thine own way Lord, have thine own
way. Thou art the potter, I am the clay." <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gates of November</span> (1996) is a
family chronicle, but depicting the real-life family of Russian Jews.
The story of Solomon and Volodya Slepak, a father and son, is
simultaneously the story of Soviet Jewry and the rise and fall of the
Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">In the
Beginning</span> (1975), about modern criticism of the Bible and
tradition, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Book of Lights</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Davita's Harp</span> (1985)
explored the conflict between religious and secular interest. "And for
as long as I am able to remember, a door harp hung on our floor.... We
mounted the harp on the back of the front door and when we opened or
closed the door the balls struck the wires and we would hear <i>ting
tang tong tung ting tang</i> &#8211; the gentlest and sweetest of tones." The
narrator is Ilana Davita Chandal, who grows up in New York in the 1930s
and 1940s, and finds the Jewish faith and her independence. Both of her
parents, Anne and Michael, are committed communists; Judaism is not a
central theme, but its opposite in the form of devotion to dialectical
materialism. Michael is killed in the Spanish Civil War, Anne leaves
the Party after the Stalin-Hitler Pact. <br>
</p>
<p>Potok's non-fiction works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Wanderings: Chaim Potok's History of the
Jews</span> (1978), in which the author combines scholarship with
dramatic narrative. <span style="font-style: italic;">Zebra and Other
Stories</span> (1998), a collection of short stories, was written for
young adults. One of the characters notes, "I think losing your soul is
when you can't tell a story about something that has happened to you."
Potok has written what he has experienced in life, but also studied
philosophical questions about suffering, the meaning of the universe,
and the existence of evil. <font size="2"> </font>"I would prefer to
say that the universe is meaningful, with pockets of apparent
meaninglessness, than to say it is meaningless with pockets of apparent
meaningfulness. In other words I have questions either way."<font size="2"> (Potok in<i> Christianity Today</i>, September 8, 1978)</font></p>
