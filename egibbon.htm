<p>English historian and scholar, the supreme historian of the Enlightenment, who is best-known as the author 
of the monumental <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>  (1776-1788). 
This register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind is often considered the 
greatest historical work written in English. His first works Gibbon wrote in French. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was at Rome, on the 15th of October,
1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the
barefoot friars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that the
idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my
mind."</b> (</font><font size="2">in</font><i><font size="2"> Memoirs of My Life</font></i><font size="2">, 1796) </font></blockquote>
<p>Edward Gibbon was born in Putney, South London, into a prosperous 
family. His father was a wealthy Tory member of Parliament, who went into 
seclusion and left his son to the care of an aunt. Gibbon was a sickly 
child and his education at Westminster and at Magdalen College, Oxford, 
was irregular. According to Gibbon's own explanation he was too bashful 
to spend his time in taverns, but his studies ended anyway after one year: 
he was expelled for turning to Roman Catholicism &#8211; a decision which was 
directed against one of his intellectually lazy Anglican 
college tutors. In 1753 Gibbon was sent by his father to Lausanne, 
Switzerland. During this period of his life, he  met  <a href="/voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a>,
who had settled in 1755 near Geneva. At Fernay, Gibbon saw Voltaire
acting in the role of Tartar Conqueror, "with a hollow broken voice,
and making love to a very ugly niece of about fifty", as he said in a
letter. </p>
<p>Gibbon boarded with a Calvinist pastor and scholar, who was 

very demanding in his teaching, and had rejoined the Anglican fold. While in 
Lausanne Gibbon fell in love with Suzanne Curchod, who eventually 
married 
Jacques Necker, a banker. Their relationship was ended by his 
father, and Gibbon 
remained unmarried for the rest of his life. Suzanne became the 
mother of 
the famous writer  and early champion of women's rights, 
<a href="/stael.htm">Madame de Staël</a>.</p>
<p>From 1759 to 1762 Gibbon hold a commission in the Hampshire militia,
reaching the rank of colonel. Before 1763 Gibbon had considered various
subjects as worthy of the type of philosophical analysis that he wished
to apply to history, including the life of Sir Walter Raleigh, the
history of Switzerland. Eventually he abandoned these ideas because
thought that he had nothing original to say about Elizabethan politics
and he could not read German. After reading the first chapters of <span style="font-style: italic;">The History and the Liberty of the Swiss</span>,
written in French, to a literary society in London, Gibbon was so
depressed of the criticism he received, that he threw the sheets to the
flame. </p>
<p>In 1764 he visited Rome and was inspired to write the history of the city from times of Marcus 
Aurelius to the year 1453. After his father died Gibbon found himself in some difficulties, but he 
was able to settle in London to proceed with his great plan. The first volume appeared in 1776, 
with a certain amount of public reaction to Gibbon's ironical treatment of the rise of Christianity 
and the actions of early church fathers.  David Hume wrote admiringly, "You have the courage to despise the clamour of bigots." <br>
</p>
      <p>Gibbon examined religion as a social phenomenon &#8211; without
giving it a special sanctity. However, Gibbon saw that in one aspect
Christianity had a central role in the whole drama, namely in the fall
of the empire: "... the church and even the state were distracted by
religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always
implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to
synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny, and
the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country." </p>

<p>Between 1774 and 1783 Gibbon sat in the House of Commons, and became
a lord commissioner of trade and plantations, partly because he was
considered a nuisance as a politician. In 1774 he was elected to Dr
Johnson's Club. From 1783 Gibbon spent much of his time in Lausanne and
in England with Lord Sheffield (John Baker Holroy) in his Sussex and
London houses. Hating physical exercise, he seldom went outside even
when the weather was nice. When Gibbon had finished the second volume
of <i> The Decline and Fall</i>, he presented it to the Duke of
Gloucester, brother of King George III, who said to him: "Another
damn'd thick, square book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble! Eh! Mr.
Gibbon?" </p>
<p>After his magnum opus Gibbon wrote a memoir. It went through many
drafts and was not published during his lifetime. Lord Sheffield later
prepared Gibbon's <i>Memoirs of my Life and Writings</i> (1796) and <i>The Miscellaneous Works</i><i> </i>(1796)
for publication. Gibbon died on on January 16, 1794, in London. A
swelling in his left testicle, which Gibbon described as "almost as big
as a small child," had afflicted him for many years, and eventually
caused his death. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the second century of the Christian
era, the Empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and
the most civilized portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive
monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour. The
gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually
cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed
and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free
constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate
appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the
emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period
(A.D. 98-180) of more than fourscore years, the public administration
was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian,
and the two Antonines. It is the design of this, and of the two
succeeding chapters, to describe the prosperous condition of their
empire; and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce
the most important circumstances of its decline and fall; a revolution
which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by the nations of the
earth." </b></font></blockquote>
<p>The last three volumes of <i>The Decline and Fall </i>were published
in 1788. The book was a bestseller, and offered the reading public a
vivid narrative of the past instead of an antiquarian picture. "If he
had been more vulnerable to the glittering abstractions of his age he
might have become an English Montesquieu, writing for scholars of
political thought. If he had sought historical laws or cycles or found
some single cause, he might have been bedside reading no more than Vico
or Marx." (Daniel J. Boorstin in <i>The Creators</i>, 1992) Gibbon,
who did not much value contemporary historians, developed his own
approach and adopted influences from such diverse sources as the
"Protestant Enlightenment," Parisian philosophers, and the Scottish
Enlightenment. <br>
</p>
<p>Like Voltaire, Gibbon has been characterized as a Deist and he had
little appreciation of the metaphysical side of religion. (Later Gibbon
wrote on Voltaire: "In his way, Voltaire was a bigot, an intolerant
bigot.") Although Gibbon's conclusions have been modified, his
masterful historical perspective and literary style have secured his
place as the forerunner of English historiographers. On the other hand,
his personal habits were peculiar &#8211; according to some contemporary
comment Gibbon was so filthy that one could not stand close to him.
Gibbon's devotion to routine was also a source of jokes &#8211; this harmless
personal trait he shared with, amongst others, the German philosopher
Kant and the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard. When Benjamin Franklin was
visiting England he wanted to see Gibbon, who refused to meet him. It
did not diminish Franklin's admiration of him and he promised to help
Gibbon when he came to write the history of the decline and fall of the
British Empire. </p>
<p>In <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>
(1776-1788) Gibbon himself acknowledged his debt to Jean Mabillon
(1632-1707), Bernard Montfasucon (1655-1741), and Ludovico Muratori
(1672-1741) for their collections of facts and documents. The work
covers more than 13 centuries from the 2nd century AD to the fall of
Constantinople in 1453. The first volume begins with a survey of the
Roman empire in the age of the Antonines (AD 138-80), concluding with
the notorious chapters on Christianity, which provoked the clergy. In
the following volumes Gibbon examined the encroachment of the Teutonic
tribes who eventually held the Western Empire in fee, the rise of
Islam, and the Crusades. Christianity is dealt with in detail. The
Roman Empire is viewed as a single entity in undeviating decline from
the ideals of political and intellectual freedom that had characterized
the classical literature Gibbon had read. His conclusion was, the
material decay of Rome was the effect and symbol of moral decadence.
"Many a sober Christian would rather admit that a wafer is God than
that God is a cruel and capricious tyrant." With powerful narrative,
fluid prose, and persuasive arguments the work has a remained a classic
in historical literature. </p>
