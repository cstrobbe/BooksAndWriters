      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Irish novelist and
playwright, one
of the great names of Absurd Theatre with <a href="ionesco.htm">Eugéne
Ionesco</a>, although recent study regards Beckett as postmodernist.
His plays are concerned with human suffering and survival, and his
characters are struggling with meaninglessness and the world of the
Nothing. Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. In
his writings for the theater Beckett showed influence of burlesque,
vaudeville, the music hall, commedia dell'arte, and the silent-film
style of such figures as Keaton and Chaplin. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"We all are born mad. Some remain
so."</b> (from <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, 1952) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin into a prosperous Protestant
family. His father, William Beckett Jr., was a surveyor. Beckett's
mother, Mary Roe, had worked as a nurse before marriage. He was
educated at the Portora Royal School and Trinity College, Dublin, where
he took a B.A. degree in 1927, having specialized in French and
Italian. Beckett worked as a teacher in Belfast and lecturer in English
at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. The position included meals and living quarters. During this time he
became a friend of <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>, taking
dictation and copying down parts of what would eventually become <i>Finnegans
Wake</i> (1939). He also translated a fragment of the book into French
under Joyce's supervision. The translation was published in <span style="font-style: italic;">La Nouvelle Revue Française</span> on 1 May 1931. Joyce's daughter Lucia fell madly in love with Beckett, who was not romantically interested in her. <br>
 </p>
      <p>In 1931 Beckett returned to Dublin and received his M.A. in
1931. He taught French at Trinity College until 1932, when he resigned
to devote
his time entirely to writing. After his father died, Beckett received
an annuity that enabled him to settle in London, where he underwent
psychoanalysis (1935-36). </p>
      <p>As a poet Beckett made his debut in 1930 with <span style="font-style: italic;">Whoroscope</span>, a ninety-eight-line
poem accompanied by seventeen footnotes. In this dramatic monologue,
the protagonist, Rene Descartes, waits for his morning omelet of
well-aged eggs, while meditating on the obscurity of theological
mysteries, the passage of time, and the approach of death. It was
followed with a collection of essays, <span style="font-style: italic;">Proust&nbsp;</span>
(1931), and novel <span style="font-style: italic;">More Pricks Than
Kicks</span> (1934). From 1933 to 1936 he lived in London. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1938 Beckett
was hospitalized from a stab would he had received from a pimp to whom
he had refused to give money. Around this time he met Suzanne
Dechevaux-Dumesnil, a piano student, whom he married in 1961. When
Beckett won the Nobel Prize, Suzanne commented: "This is a
catastrophe." Beckett refused to attend the Nobel ceremony. </p>

      <p>Beckett's career as a novelist really began&nbsp; with <span style="font-style: italic;">Murphy</span> (1938), which depicted the
protagonist's inner struggle between his desires for his
prostitute-mistress and for total escape into the darkness of mind. The
conflict is resolved when he is atomized by a gas explosion. </p>
      <p>When World War II broke out, Beckett was in Ireland, but he
hastened
to Paris and joined a Resistance network. Sought by the Nazis, he fled
with
Dechevaux-Dumesnil to Southern France, where they remained in hiding in
the village of Roussillon two and half years. Beckett worked as country
laborer and wrote<span style="font-style: italic;"> Watt</span>, his second novel, which was published in 1953
and was the last of his novels written originally in English. It
portrayed the futile search of Watt (What) for understanding in the
household Mr. Knott (Not), who continually changes shapes. </p>
      <p>After the war Beckett worked briefly with the Irish Red Cross
in St. Lo in Normandy. Between 1946 and 1949 he produced the major
prose narrative trilogy, <span style="font-style: italic;">Molloy</span>,
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Malone Meurt</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;">
L'innommable</span>, which came out in the early 1950s. The novels were
written in French and subsequently translated into English with
substantial changes. Beckett said that when he wrote in French it was
easier to write "without style" &#8211; he did not try to be elegant. With
the change of language Beckett escaped from everything with which he
was familiar. These books reflected Beckett's bitter realization that
there is no escape from illusions and from the Cartesian compulsion to
think, to try to solve insoluble mysteries. Beckett was obsessed by a
desire to create what he called "a literature of the unword." He waged
a lifelong war on words, trying to yield the silence that underlines
them. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>WINNIE: Win! (Pause.) Oh this </b></font><b><i><font size="2">is</font></i><font size="2"> a happy day, this will have been
another happy day! (Pause.) After all. (Pause.) So far. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Happy Days</font></i><font size="2">, 1961)</font></blockquote>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">En attendant Godot </span>(Waiting
for Godot), written in 1949 and published in English in 1954, brought
Beckett international fame and established him as one of the leading
names of the theater of the absurd. Beckett more or less admitted in a<i>
New York Post</i> interview by Jerry Tallmer that the dialogue was
based on conversations between Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil and himself
in Roussillon. The tragi-comedy in
two acts, opened at the Théâtre de Babylone on January 5, 1953, and
made history. Two tramps, Vladimir and Estragon, who call each other
Gogo and
Didi, meet near a bare tree on a country road. They wait for the
promised
arrival of Godot, whose name could refer to 'God' or also the French
name for Charlie Chaplin, 'Charlot'. To fill the boredom they try to
recall their past, tell
jokes, eat, and speculate about Godot. Pozzo, a bourgeois tyrant, and
Lucky, his servant, appear briefly. Pozzo about Lucky: "He can't think
without his hat." Godot sends word that he will not come that day but
will surely come the next. In Act II Vladimir and and Estragon still
wait, and Godot sends a promising message. The two men try to hang
themselves and then declare their intention of leaving, but they have
no energy to move. In Beckett's philosophical show, there is no meaning
without being. The very existence of Vladimir and Estragon is in doubt.
Without
Godot, their world do not have purpose, but suicide is not the solution
to their existential dilemma. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>VLADIMIR: We have to come back
tomorrow. </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">ESTRAGO; What for? </font><br>
        <font size="2">VLADIMIR: To wait for Godot. </font><br>
        <font size="2">ESTRAGON: Ah! (Silence.) He didn't come? </font><br>
        <font size="2">VLADIMIR: No. </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>After <i>Waiting for Godot </i>Beckett wrote<span style="font-style: italic;"> Fin de partie</span> (1957, Endgame) and
a series of stage plays and brief pieces for the radio. <i>Endgame </i>developed
further one of Beckett's central themes, men in mutual dependence (Hamm
and Clov occupy a room with Nagg and Nell who are in dustbins). "One
day you'll be blind, like me", says Hamm. "You'll be sitting there, a
speck in the void, in the dark, for ever, like me." In <span style="font-style: italic;">Krapp's Last Tape </span>(1959) Beckett
returned to his native language. The play depicted an old man sitting
alone in his room. At night he listens to tape recordings from various
periods of his past. </p>
      <p>In several works Beckett used dark humor to establish distance
to his grim subjects. In his last full-length novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Comment c'est</span> (1961, How It Is) the
protagonist crawls across the mud dragging a sack of canned food behind
him. He overtakes another crawler who he tortures into speech and is
left alone waiting to be overtaken himself by another crawler who will
torture him in turn.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s Beckett wrote for radio, theater, and television.
During this decade, Billie Whitelaw became one of the most noted
interpreter of Beckett's works. Her performances include <i>Play</i>, <i>Not
I,</i> and <i>Footfalls</i>. She also acted in such films as <i>Frency</i>
(written by Anthony Shaffer, dir. by Alfred Hitchcock, 1972), <i>The
Omen (1976)</i>, <i>The Water Babies (1979)</i>, <i>Maurice </i>
(based on <a href="forster.htm">E. M. Forster</a>'s<i> </i>posthumously
published novel, dir. by James Ivory, 1987), and <i>The Krays</i>
(1990). Alan Schneider staged most of the American premiers of
Beckett's plays. Schneider also directed the short Beckett movie <i>Film</i>,
starring Buster Keaton. </p>
      <p>In the
1970s appeared <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirlitonnades </span>(1978),
a collection of short poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">Company</span> (1979) and <span style="font-style: italic;">All Strange
Away</span> (1979), which was performed in 1984 in New York. <span style="font-style: italic;">Catastrophe</span> (1984) was written for <a href="vhavel.htm">Vaclav Havel</a> and was about the interrogation of
a dissident. In 1988, <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, was produced at
Lincoln Center. Steve Martin, Robin Williams, and Bill Irwin played in
the central roles. </p>
      <p>Beckett lived on the rue St. Jacques. At the neighborhood cafe
he met his friends, drank espresso, and smoke thin cigarettes. He also
had a country house outside Paris. Beckett maintained his usual silence
even when his eightienth birthday was celebrated in Paris and New York.
At the age of seventy-six he said:<font size="2"> </font>"With
diminished concentration, loss of memory, obscured intelligence... the
more chance there is for saying something closest to what one really
is. Even though everything seems inexpressible, there remains the need
to express. A child need to make a sand castle even though it makes no
sense. In old age, with only a few grains of sand, one has the greatest
possibility."<font size="2"> (from <i>Playwrights at Work</i>, ed. by
George Plimpton, 2000) </font></p>
      <p>Beckett's wife died in 1989. The author had moved just
previously to a small nursing home, after falling in his apartment.
Beckett lived in a barely furnished room, receiving visitors, writing
until the end. From his television he watched tennis and soccer. His
last book printed in his lifetime was <span style="font-style: italic;">Stirring
Still</span> (1989). Beckett died, following respiratory problems, in a
hospital on December 22, 1989. It it rumored that Beckett gave much of
the Nobel prize money to needy artists. </p>
