<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Swedish poet and prose writer, who
was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1916. Heidenstam
represented literary reaction to naturalism, scientific world view,
bourgeois culture, and technology. He often chose patriotic themes for
his novels; his great neoromantic rival was <a href="lagerlof.htm">Selma
Lagerlöf</a>, the winner of the Nobel Prize in 1909. Much of his life
Heidenstam spent restlessly traveling. However, his works do not show
that he was especially interested in new literary currents. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Jag vet ej, varför jag vaken sitter,</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">
fast dagen ingen glädje skänkt,</font><br>
<font size="2">
men allt i mitt liv, som likt solar blänkt,</font><br>
<font size="2">
och allt, som i mörker och kval blev sänkt,</font><br>
<font size="2">
det darrari natt i en flod av glitter.</font></b><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Månljuset') </font></blockquote>
<p>Carl Gustaf Verner von Heidenstam was born at Ölshammar, his
grandmother's estate on the shores of Lake Vättern, into an
aristocratic and wealthy family. In his childhood Heidenstam got used
to being center of attention and self-assertion became part of his
perrsonality. When he dressed as a king, his grandmother told household
servants to play his underlings. At school Heidenstam was lazy,
and his educations was superficial &#8211; he had troubles in grammatical
correctness, he was mostly alone or spent time with female relatives or
friends who let him dominate the scene. At the age of sixteen his
parents sent him on a journey to Middle East, Greece, and Italy with
his cousin Ernst von Heidenstam. On the second journey his companion
was Carlo Landberg, a linguistic<b>.</b> The travels in the
Mediterranean influenced Heidenstam's first poems, which formed a
colorful contrast to the prevailing gloomy mood in literature. </p>
<p>Colonel Gustaf von Heidenstam had tried in vain to change his
son's aimless life style, and eventually sent him to Paris to study art
under Jean Léon Gérôme at the École des Beaux Arts. There Heidenstam
boasted with his great plans, emphasized his aristocratic background,
but actually did not show any ambitions to become an artists. After
returning to Sweden in 1880, he married against his father's wishes
Emilia Uggla, a Swiss woman. During the following years Heidenstam
lived with his wife in Italy, France, and Norway. </p>
<p>Heidenstam sent his early poems to the Finnish writer Zachris
Topelius, who encouraged him to continue. In 1886 the Heidenstams
leased a medieval castle in northern Switzerland. The regular visitors
there included the writer <a href="strindbe.htm">August Strindberg</a>,
with whom Heidenstam later disputed. Strindberg, who joined him on a tour
of the Tyrol and Italy, was horrified by Rome &#8211; he dismissed the
splendours of the city as bloodstained monuments of an oppressive
society. While spending some time in the Scandinavian artists' colony
at Grez-sur-Loing, Strindberg tried to lure Heidenstam there with the
promise of orgies (however, without naked women). <br>
</p>
<p>Heidenstam returned to Sweden in 1887 and settled on the family
estate. His relationship with his father had improved, but facing an
incurable illness Gustaf von Heidenstam committed suicide. He never
witnessed the appearance of his son's first collection of poems, <i>Pilgrimage
and Wander Years, </i>(1888), which was an immediate success, but
nowadays its <i>Arabian Nights</i> vision of the Middle East<b> </b>as
a place of exotic pleasures is considered outdated. Strindberg was provoked Heidenstam's manifesto&nbsp; <em>Renässans</em>
(1889), in which he rejected social realism in favour of imagination.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>During the next decade Heidenstam's output was prolific.<em>&nbsp;Endymion</em>
(1889), a novel set in Damascus, expressed the author's fear of the
decline of Orient culture due to European influences and materialism.
It was followed by a&nbsp; prose-and-verse novel&nbsp;<em>Hans Alienus</em>&nbsp;
(1892), in which the protagonist, a wanderer, depicts his problematic
relationship with his father, and<em> Dikter</em> (1895), in which the
declamatory and recitative tone do not hide Heidenstam's hopes to gain
the status of a national poet. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Oh Sweden, Sweden, native land, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Our earthly home, the haven of our longing!" </font></b></blockquote>
<p>The 1890s saw an upsurge in neoromantic historical fiction in
response to a growing nationalism. Heidenstam, a self-appointed leader
of the new movement, called for renewed national pride, arguing that
the Swedish temperament is "Scandinavia's richest and most
interesting&nbsp;&#8211; although undervalued by our neighboring nations and
denied by its own tongue." In the summer of 1907, he made speeches at
the great youth rallies held at Mösseberg and Ransäter,
prophesying&nbsp;a glorious future for Sweden which will take her&nbsp;
natural and predetermined place&nbsp;in the North.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heidenstam's closest associate was the critic and
author&nbsp;Oscar Leverting, who combined in his work passionate
Swedish patriotism with humane cosmopolitanism. When Heidenstam's&nbsp;
definition&nbsp;of the Swede's national traits&nbsp;reflected his own
aristocratic values, his friend Ellen Key, argued that "the true
Swedish character is presently found less among the upper classes than
among the common folk."&nbsp; </p>
<p>In his essays, of which <i>Renaissance</i> is perhaps the
most famous, Heidenstam called for a rejection of the treatment of
social problems &#8211; or "shoemaker's realism" &#8211; and advocated a return to
imagination, sense of beauty, and wit. In<em> Hans Alienus,</em> in
which the protagonist visits the Underworld, he exploited the exoticism
of the Near East, like in the short story 'The Lion's Cage', a mixture
of historical fantasy and philosophizing. In the story the Sultan wants
to wipe out the Brotherhood of the Truthtellers. Num Eddaula, their
leader, decides to sacrifice himself in order to save the other
truthtellers. He goes to the camp of the Sultan, where he meets the
King of Sweden, who is half prisoner and half guest of honour. The King
has lost his visions after his defeat in a battle. Num Eddaula tells
him to complete his work as a hero: "Thou has command over they
features; have command also over thyself. Thou art capable of better
things than those thou hast accomplished, and God never forgives a hero
for acting thus." Num Eddaula is executed on the following morning, but
the King in the story is without doubts Charles XII (1682-1718),
Heidenstam's hero, who was defeated at Poltava in the Ukraine, and
forced to take refuge in the Turkey until 1714. Four years later he was
killed while besieging Fredrikshall, Norway. </p>
<p>Heidenstam interest in Swedish history gave inspiration to his
most popular novel&nbsp; <em>Karolinerna</em>&nbsp;(1897-1898, The
Charles Men). It is a series of stories connected by the life of
Charles XII and his troops. Heidenstam's common soldiers occasionally
express their belief in patriotic ideals, but the thoughts of officers
are psychologically more complex. The author also visited in the
mid-1890s the battle grounds in Poltava, where he picked deeply moved
flowers and sent them to the Swedish poet and diplomat Carl Snoilsky.
Heidenstam saw in <i>The Charles Men </i>the King as a tragic
character and when his sarcophagi was opened in 1917, Heidenstam was
present. However, when the book appeared, Heidenstam was first accused
of having smeared his idol. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Bort gå de, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">stumma skrida de </font><br>
<font size="2">en efter en till skuggornas värld. </font><br>
<font size="2">Klockorna dåna. Tungt slå de, </font><br>
<font size="2">mullra och kvida de, </font><br>
<font size="2">sjunga sin sång till dödas färd." </font></b><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Gustaf Frödings jordafärd') </font></blockquote>
<p>After the death of his first wife in 1893, whom he had treated
coldly, Heidenstam married Olga Wiberg, but the marriage soon ended to
divorce. However, their weddings was a colorful event: the guests were
dressed in Roman togas, and the artists Carl Larsson and Anders Zorn
had designed a special journal, <i>Evoi</i>, for the occasion. </p>
<p>In 1900 Heidenstam married Greta Sjöberg, who was nearly
twenty years his junior &#8211; the marriage was also short-lived.
Heidenstam's interest in the Swedish past continued in <em>Heliga
Birgittas pilgrimsfärd</em> (1901), in which St. Birgitta becomes the
author's alter ego, <em>Folkungaträdet </em>(2 vols., 1905-1907),
describing the foundation of the kingdom of Sweden, and <em>Svenskarna
och deras hövdingar</em> (1908-1910), originally meant to be a
pedagogic textbook. In the 1910s, when Heidenstam had abandoned his
radical ideals and defended strongly the aristocracy, he was labelled
as "the Junkers poet" according to the conservative, militaristic
landowners of Prussia. </p>
<p>Heidenstam's later works include a collection of poems <em>Nya
dikter</em> (1915), in which he returned to ideals of beauty of his
earlier poems, and <em>När kastanjerna blommade</em>, in which he
again wrote admiringly about his father. The book&nbsp;came out
&nbsp;posthumously in 1941. </p>
<p>In the so-called Strindberg Feud of 1910-12, a press polemic
on art, politics, and religion, Heidenstam become one of Strindberg's
targets, with the rest of Sweden. Strindberg called Heidenstam
"Sweden's most unintelligent man" and&nbsp;described Heidenstam's
friend, the critic and author&nbsp;Oscar Levertin&nbsp;as his "greatest
enemy" in his <em>Occult Diary</em>. After receiving the Nobel Prize,
Heidenstam fell silent as an author. In the 1920s Heidenstam had
designed and constructed a home at Övralid, near Lake Vättern, where he
lived quietly. "O Man, you will become wise only when you reach the
summit of the evening-cool heights where all the earth is beheld."
Heidenstam did not publish further works, and his physical and mental
health gradually deteriorated. During this period his companion was
Kate Bang, whose two children became close to him. Heidenstam died on
May 20, 1940. In the Swedish Social Democratic society Heidenstam's
reputation declined gradually to the point of eclipse for decades.
Moreover, he was&nbsp;suspected of&nbsp;as having been a Nazi
sympathizer.<strong> </strong>
