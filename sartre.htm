<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist, playwright,
existentialist
philosopher , and literary critic. Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize
for
literature in 1964, but he declined the honor in protest of the values
of bourgeois society. His longtime companion was <a href="beauvoir.htm">Simone
de Beauvoir</a> (1908-1986), whom he met at the École Normale
Superieure in 1929.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The bad novel aims to please by
flattering, whereas the good one is an exigence and an act of faith.
But above all, the unique point of view from which the author can
present the world to those freedoms whose concurrence he wishes to
bring about is that of a world to be impregnated always with more
freedom."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">What Is Literature</font></i><font size="2">, 1947) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Jean-Paul Sartre was born in Paris. His father, Jean-Babtiste
Sartre, was a naval officer, who died when Jean-Paul was fifteen months
old. Sartre never wrote much about his biological father. More
important person in his life was his mother, the former Anne-Marie
Schweitzer, a great nephew of Albert Schweitzer. Sartre lived first
with her and his grandfather, Charles Schweitzer in Paris, but when his
mother remarried in 1917, the family moved to La Rochelle. </p>
      <p>At school, Sartre was brilliant, but his behavior was behavior
was often unpredictable and arrogant. When his friend Raymond Aron
played tennis, Sartre preferred giant swings on the horizontal bar. He
graduated in 1929 from the Ècole Normale Supérieure. From 1931 to 1945
he worked as a teacher. During this period he also traveled in Egypt,
Greece, and Italy. In 1933-34 he studied in Berlin the writings of the
German philosophers Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. </p>
      <p>At the Left Bank cafés Sartre gathered around him a group of
intellectuals in the 1930s. During WW II Sartre was drafted in 1939,
imprisoned a year later in Germany, but released in 1941 (or he
escaped). However, he lost his freedom he valued above all for a short
time. In Paris he joined resistance movement and wrote for such
magazines as <i>Les Lettres Française</i> and <i>Combat</i>. Sartre
and Beauvoir met <a href="acamus.htm">Albert Camus</a>&nbsp;in Paris
at the opening performance of <em>Les Mouches</em> in 1943; they
talked about books. Sartre had given Camus's works good reviews in the <em>Alger
Républicain</em>. </p>
      <p>After the war he founded a monthly literary and political
review, <i>Les Temps modernes, </i>and devoted himself entirely to
writing and political activity. The magazine took its title from
Chaplin's film. Sartre wrote both about and for the cinema. On a visit
to the United States in 1945 he saw <i>Citizen Kane</i> and criticized
Welles for using flashbacks. "Orson Welles&#8217;s <i>oeuvre</i> well
illustrated the drama of the American intelligentsia which is rootless
and totally cut off from the masses." </p>
      <p>Sartre was never a member of Communist party, although he
tried to reconcile existentialism and Marxism and collaborated with the
French Communist Party. When Camus, with whom Sartre was closely linked
in the 1940, openly criticized Stalinism, Sartre hesitated to follow
his example. The publication of Camus's novel <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Homme révolté</span> (1951), which
explores the theories and forms of humanity's revolt against authority,
caused a break between th ye two friends. Unwilling to review the book
himself, the task was assigned to Francis Jeanson, a junior member of <i>Les
Temps modernes</i>, whose article was violent and slashing. Camus was
offended and wrote a seventeen-page reply to "M. Le Directeur" (To the
Editor), never once mentioning Jeanson. Sartre responded with a
scornful letter: "You do us the honor of contributing to this issue of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Les Temps modernes</span>, but you bring
a portable pedestal with you." After accusing Camus of setting himself
above criticism, he continued: "What is disconcertating about your
letter is that it is too well written. I do not reproach you for its
pomposity, which comes naturally to you, but rather for the ease with
which you handle your indignation."<br>
      </p>
      <p>Sartre's first novel,&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>La Nausée</em></span>
(1938), expressed under the influence of German philosopher Edmund
Husserl's phenomenological method, that human life has no purpose. The
protagonist, Antoine Roquentin, discovers the obscene overabundance of
the world around him, and his own solitude induces several experiences
of psychological nausea. He is not only impressed by the solidity of
the stones on the sea shore, but feels similar kind of horror when he
contemplates the world of bourgeois banality. "Nobody is better
qualified than the commercial traveller over there to sell Swan
toothpaste. Nobody is better qualified than that interesting young man
to fumble about under his neighbour's skirts. And I am among them and
if they look at me they must think that nobody is better qualified than
I to do what I do. But I <i>know</i>. I don't look very important but
I know that I exists and that they exists. And if I knew the art of
convincing people, I should go and sit down next to that handsome
white-haired gentleman and I should explain to him what existence is.
The thought of the look which would come on to his face if I did makes
me burst out laughing."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>The
rationality and solidity of this world, Roquentin thinks, is a veneer. </p>
      <p><em>Le Mur</em>&nbsp;(1938) was a collection of five stories
and a novella, which concentrated on the theme of self-decption (or
"bad faith"). In' The Childhood of a Leader' the pitiful hero, Lucien,
believes that he does not really exists, he only an actor in his own
life. He seeks a feeling of strength through a homosexual affair.
Encouraged by his friend, Lucien ends up in the ultra-conservative
organization of the Action Française, with a desire to purify the
French blood and beat the Jews. Lucien's choices are not authentic, he
acts in conformity.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Man can will nothing unless he has first
understood
that he must count no one but himself; that he is alone, abandoned on
earth in the midst of his infinite responsibilities, without help, with
no other aim than the one he sets himself, with no other destiny than
the one he forges for himself on this earth</b>." (from <i>L'Être et
le Néant / Being and Nothingness</i>, 1943)</font></blockquote>
      <p>In his non-fiction works&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>L'Être et
le Néant</em></span> (1943, Being and Nothingness) Sartre formulated
the basics of his philosophical system, in which "existence is prior to
essence." Sartre made the distinction between things that exist in
themselves (<i>en-soi</i>) and human beings who exist for themselves (<i>pour-soi</i>).
Conscious of the limits of knowledge and of mortality, human beings
live with existential dread. "Man is not the sum of what he has but the
totality of what he does not yet have, of what he might have."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(in <i>Situations</i>, 1947) </font>Sartre
developed his ideas further in&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>L'existentialisme
est un humanisme</em></span> (1946), and <em>Critique de la raison
dialectique</em> (1960). According to Sartre, human being is terrifying
free. We are responsible for the choices we make, we are responsible
for our emotional lives. In a godless universe life has no meaning or
purpose beyond the goals that each man sets for himself. In <i>Being
and Nothingness</i> Sartre argued that an individual must detach
oneself from things to give them meaning. </p>
      <p>Sartre's first play, <span class="st"><em>Les Mouches</em> </span>(1943),
examined the themes of commitment and responsibility. In the story, set
in the ancient, mythical Greece, Orestes kills the murderers of
Agamemnon, thus freeing the people of the city from the burden of
guilt. According to Sartre's existentialist view, only one who chooses
to assume responsibility of acting in a particular situation, like
Orestes, makes effective use of one's freedom. In his second play,&nbsp;<em>Huis
Clos</em> (1944), a man who loves only himself, a lesbian, and a
nymphomaniac are forced to live in a small room after their deaths. At
the end <font face="Symbol">-</font> although realizing that the "hell
is other people"<font face="Symbol"> -</font> they
remain slaves to their of passions. The play was a sensation and was
filmed in 1954. Sartre's screenplay <em>Typhus</em>, which he wrote in
1944, was produced in 1953, starring Michèle Morgan and Gérard Philipe.
The director was Yves Allégret. </p>
      <p><span class="st"><em>Qu'est-ce que la littérature?</em></span>&nbsp;(1947)
is Sartre's best-known book of literary criticism. He grouped poetry
with painting, sculpture, and music <font face="Symbol">-</font> they
are not signs but things. One of the chief motifs of artistic creation
is the need of feeling that we are essential in relationship to the
world. A writer is always a watchdog or a jester, but the primarly
function of the writer is to act in such a way that nobody can be
ignorant of the world: a novelist cannot escape engagement in political
and social issues. The reader brings to life the literary object <font face="Symbol">-</font> it is not true that one writes for oneself. On
the other hand Sartre saw that literature is dying and alludes to
newspapers, to the radio and movies. "The goal of art is to recover
this world by giving it to be seen not as it is, but as if it had its
source in human freedom." From 1946 to 1955 Sartre wrote several
biographical studies, of which the most important was <i>Saint Genet:
Actor and Martyr</i> (1952), about his friend
Jean Genet (1910-1986), a convicted felon and writer. </p>
      <p>After Stalin's death in 1953, Sartre accepted the right to
criticize the Soviet system although he defended the Soviet state. He
visited the Soviet Union next year and was hospitalized for ten days
because of exhaustion. With his interpreter, Lena Zonina, he had a love
affair. In 1956 Sartre spoke out on behalf of freedom for Hungarians,
condemning the Soviet invasion, but not the Russian people, and in 1968
he condemned the Warsaw Pact assault on Czechoslovakia. In the Soviet
Union, Sartre was privately criticized by the Soviet premier Nikita
Khrushchev. The O.A.S. (Organisation de l'Armee Secrete), engaged in
terrorist activities against Algerian independence, exploded a bomb in
1961 in Sartre's apartment on rue Bonaparte; it happened also next year
and Sartre moved on quai Louis-Blériot, opposite the Eiffel tower. </p>
      <p>A superb conversationalist, Sartre unexpectedly lost his
debate with the philosopher Louis Althusser, perhaps the only time in
his public life. Althusser had joined the French Communist Party in
1948, and during the 1960s and 1970s he was considered the most
influential voice in Western Marxism. </p>
      <p>At the height of the student rebellion, which Sartre
supported, his main interest lay on his four-volume study called <em>L'Idiot
de la famille</em>. The wide biography of <a href="flaubert.htm">Gustave
Flaubert</a> used Freudian interpretations and Marxist social and
historical elements, familiar from his philosophical work. Sartre had
been preoccupied with Flaubert since childhood. In this study, finished
in 1971, Sartre showed how Flaubert became the person his family and
society determined him to be, and how Flaubert's choices summarized the
historical situation of his class. While writing this work, Sartre used
Corydrane. The drug, a combination of aspirin and amphetamine, was
popular among students and intellectuals. Also race bicyclists used it
in the 1960s. </p>
      <p>Sartre became also closely involved in movement against
Vietnam War. In 1967 Sartre headed the International War Crimes
Tribunal, set up by Bertrand Russell to judge American military conduct
in Indochina. Among the New Left Sartre was a highly respected figure
and his stand on the French colonial policy in Algeria was widely known
in the Third World. One of his most powerful texts, written under the
influence of Corydrane, was the foreword to Frantz Fanon's <i>The
Wretched of the Earth</i> (1961), published toward the end the of the
Algerian War. The book was soon translated into seventeen languages. </p>
      <p>In 1970 Sartre was arrested because of selling on the streets
the forbidden Maoist paper <i>La cause du peuple</i>. Sartre was
familair with the though of Mao Tse-tung and he had traveled in China
in 1955 with Beauvoir, who decided to write a whole book about the
country. However, in the early 1960s the Cuban economic and social
revolution fascinated Sartre more. He also met Fidel Castro, but broke
with his dictatorship later. In 1974 Sartre visited the terrorist
Andreas Baader at the prison of Stammheim in Germany. </p>
      <p><i>L'idiot </i>was Sartre's last large work; it remained
unfinished. According to Sartre, the fact that he will never finish it
"does not make me so unhappy, because I think I said the most important
things in the first three volumes." From 1973 the philosopher suffered
from failing eyesight and near the end of his life Sartre was blind.
Sartre died in Paris of oedema of the lungs on April 15, 1980. Arlette
Elkaïm, Sartre's mistress whom he had adopted in 1965, received the
rights to his literary heritage, not Simone de Beauvoir. </p>
      <p>Like Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald after WWI, Sartre was
considered after WW II the leading interpreter of the postwar
generation's world view. In his essays Sartre dealt with wide range of
subjects, sometimes in provocative manner. 'The Republic of Silence'
starts, 'We were never more free than under the German occupation',
explaining this later that in those circumstances each gesture had the
weight of a commitment. In 'The Humanism of Existentialism' he
condensed the major theme of existentialist philosophy simply "first of
all, man exist, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards,
defines himself". </p>
