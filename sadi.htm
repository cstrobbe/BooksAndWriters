      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Persian poet and prose
writer, whose best-known works include <i>Bustân</i> (1256-57, The
Fruit Garden), which contains histories, personal anecdotes, fables and
moral instructions, and <i>Golestân </i>(1258, The Rose Garden), a
didactic work composed both of prose and verse. Sa'di is basically a
moralist whose stories have similarities with <a href="fontaine.htm">Jean
de La Fontaine</a>'s (1621-1695) fables. In Persia his golden maxims
were highly valued and considered a treasure of true wisdom. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Condonation is laudable but

        <font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> The Rose Garden</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Shaykh Sa&#8217;di (Sa'di Shirazi), byname of Musharrif Od-din
Muslih Od-din, was born in Shiraz (now in Iran). Little is known of his
life, starting from the exact date of his birth. And Sa'di's
autobiographical references in his writings are not necessarily meant
to be taken literally. The year of Sa'di's birth is in some sources
1184, due to some misconceptions, and Sa'di did not die at the age of
108. However, it is known that Sa'di was orphaned at an early age.
Later he mover to Baghdad, where he studied at the Nezamiyeh College.
After completing his studies, Sa'di took to a wandering life. Also the
conditions in Persia were unsettled. The Mongols had turned against the
Islamic states and eventually conquered Baghdad in 1258. One of Sa'di's
odes is a lament on the fall of the city. </p>
      <p>Sa'di traveled in the Middle East, he was captured in North
Africa by the Franks and was forced to labor on the fortress of
Tripoli. It is possible that Sa'di made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Sa'di
claims also to have visited Kashghar and India. In 1256-57 Sa'di
returned to his native Shiraz and become known as a writer. His
pseudonym Sa'di took from the local ruler, Sa'd ibn Zangi. After a long
end eventful life, Sa'di died in Shiraz on December 9, 1292. His tomb
is considered a national shrine. </p>
      <p>The complete works of Sa'di were published in Persian at
Calcutta in 1791-95. Sadi's writings were first translated into French
in 1634 and into German twenty years later. La Fontaine based his 'Le
songe d'un habitant du Mogol' on a story from <i>Golestân </i>(chapter
2:16), Diderot, Voltaire, Hugo and Balzac referred to Sa'di's works,
and Goethe had adaptations from him in <i>West-Ostlicher Divan</i>. In
the United States Ralph Waldo Emerson addressed a poem of his own to
Sa'di. The publishing firm of Allan and Co., of London, brought in 1928
a volume called <em>Tales from the Gulistan or Rose-Garden of the
Sheikh Sadi of Shiraz</em>, translated by Sir Richard Burton. However,
this translation is nearly identical with an earlier one, generally
attributed to Edward Rehatsek. <font size="2">(see 'Did Sir Richard
Burton Translate Sadi's <em>Gulistan</em>?' by J.D. Yohannan, in <em>The
Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</em>,&nbsp;July 1950) </font></p>
      <p>Sa'di was a contemporary of <a href="rumi.htm">Jalal ad-Din
Rumi </a>(1207-1273), famous for his didactic epic <i>Masnavi-ye
Ma'navi </i>(Spiritual Couplets). The theme of Rumi's <i>ghazals</i>
was sacred love; Sa'di wrote about profane love, although some of his <i>ghazals
      </i>were mystical: "I am happy through the world because the
world is happy through Him; / I love the whole world because the whole
world is His." The <i>ghazal </i>form, which Sa'di popularized, had
been neglected until the thirteenth century. His work paved way for
Hafez (d. c. 1388), who become considered the master of the form. In
the <i>ghazals</i> (lyrical odes) the two lines of the first couplet
rhyme with one another and with the second line of the following
couplets, the individual couplets are often independent of each other.
Sa'di's <i>ghazals</i> were held together by an unifying view. </p>
      <p>Following the conventions of traditional Persian poetry, in
many poems Sa'di's beloved is a young man, not a beautiful
woman.&nbsp;Sa'di's own attitude toward homosexuals was more negative
than positive. In the <i>Golestân</i> he stated, "If a Tatar slays
that hermaphrodite / The Tatar must not be slain in return." (3:12).
Another story tells of the qazi of Hamdan whose affection towards a
farrier-boy is condemned by his friends and the king, who eventually
says: "Everyone of you who are bearers of your own faults / Ought not
to blame others for their defects." In the West the homoerotic parts of
this work <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> often were changed
in the early editions. </p>
      <p>Both the <i>Bustân </i>and the Golestân opened
with chapters on kingship and good government. They were not only
intended for shahs and viziers to illuminate the way to better
governance based on Sufi values, but they also reflected personal
experiences. Sa'di's style is pure, simple and elegant, his tone is
sometimes severe, sometimes cheerful, blending humor with cynicism. He
also produced a collection of pornographic anecdotes, <i>Khabisat</i>,
written by a commission of his friend. The <i>Bustân</i>
was presented
to the local ruler, reminding him in the opening lines of the majety of
God: "The heads of kings, neckexalting, / Are at His court, on the
ground of supplication." The work was Sufi in spirit, but with
pragmatic touch. It consisted of "dissertations on justice, good
government, beneficence, earthly and mystic love, humility,
submissiveness, contentment and other excellences" (R. Levy). <br>
</p>
      <p>The <i>Golestân</i><i>
      </i>dealt with various subjects,
from the manners of kings to the
rules for conduct in life. On the cause for composing the book Sa'di
wrote: "I may compose for the amusement of those who look and for the
instruction of those who are present a book of a Rose Garden, a
Gulistan, whose leaves cannot be touched by the tyranny of autumnal
blasts and the delight of whose spring the vicissitudes of time will be
unable to change into the inconstancy of autumn." Both books contained
reflections on the behavior and teachings of dervishes, with whom Sa'di
sympathized. Until the 1940s, before Sa'di went out of fashion and
became an object of ridicule, the work served at schools as a model of
perfect prose. <br>
