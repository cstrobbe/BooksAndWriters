<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Danish writer, famous for his
fairy tales, which were not meant merely for children but for adults as
well. Andersen used frequently colloquial style that disguises the
sophisticated moral teachings of his tales. Before achieving success as
a playwright and novelist, Andersen was trained as singer and actor.
Many of Andersen's fairy tales depict characters who gain happiness in
life after suffering and conflicts. 'The Ugly Duckling' and 'The Little
Mermaid' are Andersen's most intimate works. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">He
now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled
him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him;
for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with
their beaks, as a welcome."</font></b><font size="2"> (from 'The Ugly
Duckling')</font> </blockquote>
      <p>Hans Christian Andersen was born in the slums of Odense, where
the family lived in a one-room house. His father, Hans Andersen, was a
poor shoemaker and literate, who believed he was of aristocratic
origin. Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, worked as
washerwoman. Although she was uneducated and superstitious, she opened
for his son the world of folklore. Later Andersen depicted her in his
novels and in the story 'Hun duede ikke'. Anne Marie declined into
alcoholism and died in 1833 in a charitable old people's home.
Andersen's half-sister Karen Marie may have worked as a prostitute for
a time; she contacted her famous brother only a few times before dying
in 1846. </p>
      <p>Andersen received little education. As a child he was highly
emotional, suffering all kinds of fears and humiliations because of his
tallness and effeminate interests. Andersen's hysterical attacks of
cramps were falsely diagnosed as epileptic fits. Several biographers
have suggested that he may have been a victim of sexual abuse as a
child. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Encouraged by his parents Andersen composed his own fairy
tales and arrange puppet theatre shows. His father loved literatuire
and took Andersen often to the playhouse. "My father gratified me in
all my wishes," wrote Andersen in <i>The True Story of My Life</i>
(1846). "I possessed his whole heart; he lived for me. On Sundays, he
made me perspective glasses, theatres, and pictures which could be
changed; he read to me from Holberg's plays and the Arabian Tales; it
was only in such moments as these that I can remember to have seen him
really cheerful, for he never felt himself happy in his life and as a
handicrafts-man."</p>
      <p>In 1816 his father died and Andersen was forced to go to work.
He helped his grandmother at a hospital for the insane, and for a short
time apprenticed to a weaver and tailor. He also worked at a tobacco
factory, where his trousers were pulled down when other workers
suspected that he was a girl. <br>
      </p>
      <p>At the age of 14 Andersen moved to Copenhagen to start a
career as a singer, dancer or an actor&nbsp;&#8211; he had a beautiful
soprano voice. The following three years were full of hardships
although he found supporters who paved his way to the theatre. Andersen
succeeded in becoming associated with the Royal Theater, but he had to
leave it when his voice began to change. When he was casually referred
as a poet it changed his plans: "It went through me, body and soul, and
tears filled my eyes. I knew that, from this very moment, my mind was
awake to writing and poetry." He then began to write plays, all of
which were rejected. </p>
      <p>In 1822 Jonas Collin, one of the directors of the Royal
Theatre and an influential government official, gave Andersen a grant
to enter the grammar school at Slagelse. He lived in the home of the
school headmaster Meisling, who was annoyed at the oversensitive
student and tried to harden his character. Other pupils were much
younger, 11-year-olds, among whom six years older Andersen was
definitely overgrown. Due to his appearance &#8211; he had a long nose and
close-set eyes &#8211; he drew also unvanted attention. Even his walk was
considered unmanly; one contemporary described it as "a hopping along
almost like a monkey". The headmaster referred to him as an "overgrown
lump". <br>
      </p>
      <p>Collin arranged in 1827 a private tuition for Andersen. He
gained admission to Copenhagen University, where he completed his
education. In 1828 Andersen wrote a travel sketch, <i>Fodreise fra
Holmens Kanal Til Østpynten af Amager</i>, a fantastic tale in the
style of the German Romantic writer E.T.A. Hoffmann. <a href="jgrimm.htm">Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</a>'s <i>Children's and
Household Tales </i>had appeared between 1812 and 1815, but they were
based on original folktales. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Andersen's poem 'The Dying Child,' was published in a
Copenhagen journal and the Royal Theatre produced in 1829 his musical
drama. <em>Phantasier og Skizzer</em>, a collection of poems, was born
when Andersen fell in love with Riborg Voigt, who was secretly engaged
to the local chemist's son. "She has a lovely, pious face, quite
child-like, but her eyes looker clever and thoughtful, they were brown
and very vivid," Andersen remembered in<i> The Book of My Life</i>.
Riborg married the chemists's son, Poul Bøving, in 1831. A leather
pouch containing a letter from Riborg was found round Andersen's neck
when he died. Also Edvard, Jonas Collin's son, and Henrik Stempe in the
1840s were for Andersen other objects of unfulfilled dreams. </p>
      <p>"I do wish that I were dead," Andersen said to one of his
friends in 1831, expressing not his feelings about his failed love for
Riborg but also echoing the melancholy of Goethe's Werther from <i>The
Sorrows of Young Werther</i> (1774). Andersen never met Goethe, who was
still alive when Andersen made his first journey to Germany. The visit
inspired the first of his many travel sketches. <br>
      </p>
      <p>From 1831 onwards Andersen travelled widely in Europe, and
remained a passionate traveller all his life.He wrote sketches about
Sweden, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and the Middle East. During his
journeys Andersen met in Paris among others Victor Hugo, Heinrich
Heine, Balzac, and Alexandre Dumas. <i>A Poet's Day Dreams </i>(1853)
Andersen dedicated to Charles Dickens, whom he met in the summer of
1857. And in Rome he met the young Norwegian writer Björnson. Andersen
lacked sufficient command of English and after staying with Dickens at 
Gad's Hill, his host stuck a brief note in the guest room saying: "Hans
Andersen slept in this room for five weeks which seemed to the family
AGES!" <br>
      </p>
      <p>As a novelist Andersen made his breakthrough with <i>The
Improvisatore (</i>1835), using Italy as the setting. The story was
autobiographical and depicted a poor boy's integration into society, an
Ugly Duckling theme of self-discovery in which Andersen returned in
several of his works. The book gained international success and during
his life it remained the most widely read of all his works. <a href="../../../ebrownin.htm">E.B. Browning</a> wrote warmly to her
future husband of the novel and her last poem was written for Andersen
in 1861, shortly before her death. <i>Only a Fiddler </i>(1837),
Andersen's novel, was attacked by the philosopher <a href="kierkega.htm">Søren Kierkegaard</a> in his book <i>Af En endnu
Levendes Papirer</i> (1838, From the Papers of a Person Still Alive,
Published Against his Will). "The joyless struggle that is Andersen's
in real life now repeats itself in his writing," he wrote. Kierkegaard,
the 'Ugly Duckling' of Danish philosophy, used a number of pseudonyms,
none of whom 'agreed' with one another. A little later, Andersen took
his revenge with the play <i>En Comedie i det Grønne </i>(1840),
which included an unpractical philosopher. </p>
      <p>Andersen's fame rests on his<i> Fairy Tales and Stories</i>,
written between 1835 and 1872. <i>Tales, Told for Children</i>,
appeared in a small, cheap booklet in 1835. In this and following early
collections, which were published in every Christmas, Andersen returned
to the stories which he had heard as a child, but gradually he started
to create his own tales. The third volume, published in 1837, contained
'The Little Mermaid' and 'The Emperor's New Clothes.' Among
Andersen's other best known tales are 'Little Ugly Duckling,' 'The
Tinderbox,' 'Little Claus and Big Claus,' 'Princess
and the Pea,' 'The Snow Queen,' The Nightingale,' and 'The Steadfast
Tin Soldier.' With these collections, inspired by the great tradition
of
the <i>Arabian Nights</i> on the other hand, and <i>Household Tales</i>,
collected by the brothers Grimm, Andersen became known as the father of
the modern fairytale. Moreover, Andersen's works were original. Only 12
of his 156 know fairy stories drew on folktales.</p>
      <p>Andersen broke new ground in both style and content, and
employed the idioms and constructions of spoken language in a way that
was new in Danish writing. When fairy tales at his time were didactic,
he brought into them ambiguity. Children and misfits often speak truth;
they serve as Andersen's mouthpiece in moral questions: ""But he has
nothing on at all," said a little child at last. "Good heavens! listen
to the voice of an innocent child," said the father, and one whispered
to the other what the child had said. "But he has nothing on at all,"
cried at last the whole people. That made a deep impression upon the
emperor, for it seemed to him that they were right; but he thought to
himself, "Now I must bear up to the end." And the chamberlains walked
with still greater dignity, as if they carried train which did not
exist."<font size="2"><b> </b></font><font size="2">(from 'The
Emperor's New Suit,' 1837) </font>Ugliness of the hero or heroine
often conceals great beauty, which is revealed after misfortunes. In
psychoanalysis this kind of figure is sometimes interpreted as a symbol
of the inner self of soul, which has to be released from its prison.</p>
      <p>Andersen's identification with the unfortunate and outcast
made his tales very compelling. Some of Andersen's tales revealed an
optimistic belief in the triumph of the good, among them 'The Snow
Queen' and 'Little Ugly Duckling', and some ended unhappily, like 'The
Little Match Girl.' In 'The Little Mermaid' the author expressed a
longing for ordinary life - he never had such. In the story the
youngest of six mermaid precesses longs after the land above the sea,
but the fulfillment of the dream causes her much pain. "She knew this
was the last evening she would ever see him for whom she had forsaken
her kindred and her home, given up her lovely voice, and daily suffered
unending torment&nbsp;&#8211; and he had no idea of it. This was the last
night she would breathe the same air as he, or look upon the deep sea
and the starry blue sky; an everlasting night without thoughts or
dreams waited her, for she had no soul and could not gain one."<font size="2"> (translated by&nbsp;L.W. Kingsland)</font></p>
      <p>Andersen's tales were translated throughout Europe, with four
editions appearing in the UK in 1846 alone. His works influenced among
others <a href="../../../dickens.htm">Charles Dickens</a> ('A
Christmas Carol in Prose,' 'The Chimes,' 'The Cricket on the Hearth.'
'The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain'), Willam Thackeray and <a href="../../../owilde.htm">Oscar Wilde</a> ('The Happy Prince,' 'The
Nightingale and the Rose,' 'The Fisherman and His Soul'), C.S. Lewis,
Isak Dinesen, P.O. Enquist, whose play, <i>Rainsnakes</i>, was about
Andersen, Cees Noteboom, and a number of other writers. Elias
Bredsdorff has complained in his book <i>Hans Christian Andersen: The
Story of His Life and Work </i>(1975), that Andersen's tales have been
bowdlerized and sweetened by Victorian British translators.</p>
      <p>Andersen's last unfilled love was the Swedish opera singer
Jenny Lind, whom he met first time in 1840. Jenny was the illegitimate
daughter of a schoolmistress. According to her own words, she was at
the age of nine "a small, ugly, broad-nosed, shy, gauche, altogether
undergrown girl". At eighteen, she had made her breakthrough as a
singer with her powerful soprano. 'The Ugly Duckling' become Jenny's
favorite among Andersen's stories. However, 'Andersen's 'The
Nightingale' is considered a tribute to Jenny, or "the Swedish
Nightingale" as she was called. "Farewell," she wrote him in 1844, "God
bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate
sister, Jenny." Andersen never married. </p>
      <p>Between the years 1840 and 1857 Andersen made journeys
throughout Europa, Asia Minor, and Africa, recording his impressions
and adventures in a number of travel books. He wrote and rewrote his
memoirs, <i>The Fairy Tale of My Life</i>, but the standard edition is
generally considered the 1855 edition. <br>
      </p>
      <p>During his travels abroad, Andersen was able to be more
relaxed and take more liberties than in Copenhagen, where everybody
knew him. At the age of sixty-two Andersen went to Paris, where he
visited a brothel&nbsp;&#8211; it was not his first visit or last. "Then went
suddenly up into a meat market&nbsp;&#8211; one of them was covered with
powder; a second, common; a third, quite the lady. I talked with her,
paid twelve francs and left, without having sinned in deed, though I
dare say I did in my thoughts. She asked me to come back, said I was
indeed very innocent for a man." <font size="2">(from </font><font size="2"><i>Hans Christian Andersen: The Life of a Storyteller</i> by
Jackie Wullschlager, 2001)</font><font size="2"> </font>Andersen died
in his home in Rolighed on August 4, 1875. Edvard Collin and his wife
were later buried with Andersen. However, their family members moved
the Collins' bodies after some years to the family plot in another
cemetery. </p>
