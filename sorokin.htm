<P>Russian novelist, playwright, screenwriter, who has challenged in his work societal norms and aeshetic taboos through a mixture of provocative sexual themes, stylistic parodies, pastiches, and  foul language. A member of the generation of writers, who appeared on literary scene during the perestroika period, Sorokin has turned away from conventional realistic prose in favor of postmodern artistic devices. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;We still live in a country that was established by Ivan the Terrible.&quot;</B> (Sorokin in an interview, <I>Spiegel Magazine</I>, February 2, 2007) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Vladimir Georgievich Sorokin was born in Bykovo, a small town near Moscow. His father was a professor of metallurgy. As a child, Sorokin stuttered badly, but art provided an opportunity for self-expression. He listened to all kinds of music and from the ages of eight to 12, he studied at Moscow's Pushkin Museum at an art workshop. </P>
<P>In the mid-1970s Sorokin joined a group of artists and writers, who rejected the conventions of traditional 
art and aesthetic values exemplified in Socialist realism.  In the same year he graduated as an engineer from 
the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, but instead of pursuing a career in industry or in the public sector, he 
turned to book illustration, participated in art exhibitions, and took various jobs. He has also taught Russian 
literature and language in Japan. In 1977 Sorokin married  a music teacher named Irina; they had two children. </P>
<P>Sorokin's early stories were circulated in samizdat editions. <I>Ochered' </I>(The Queue), initially published 
in 1985 in Paris by the journal <I>Syntaxe</I>, was a Soviet version of Beckett's <I>Waiting for Godot</I>. 
It  consisted of street dialogue of Russian shoppers, lined up and waiting to buy an unspecified item of 
clothing, perhaps denims. Using a range of voices, Sorokin portrayed a stagnated society that has stopped 
making sense. 
</P>
<P>Sorokin's first book,  which was published in Russia, was  <I>Sbornik rasskazov</I> (1992). This  collection of stories was nominated for a Russian Booker Award. <I>Norma</I> (1994), a Brezhnev-era grotesque fantasy, and <I>Roman</I> (1994) both experimented with stylistic devices; the latter, which begins like a classic Russian novel, ends in the destruction of all old values, when the protagonist, a young artist named Roman, butchers all of his wedding guests. </P>
<P>Like Marquis de Sade and Georges Bataille, Sorokin has used pornographic imagery in order to accentuate his views on art and society. In <I>Tridtsataia liubov&#146; Mariny</I> (1995) Sorokin parallels pornography with Soviet-type literary conventions. Marina, the protagonist, hops from bed to bed in pastiches of fiction depicting sex scenes. After 29 lesbian relationships and raped by Communist ideology, Marina's last empty role is a model Soviet citizen. The last chapters, written without any attempt to authenticity, are practicaly unreadable, and destroy the very idea of literature. </P>
<P>From the beginning of his literary career, Sorokin has attacked all forms of totalitarian thought and practice. <I>Mesiats v Dakhau</I> (1992) dealt with the relationship between German and Russian totalitarianism within a sado-masochist and cannibalistic frame. In <I>Denj' oprichnika</I> (2006), in which Sorokin's target was the Kremlin, the heart of Russia, the times of Ivan the Terrible were transposed to the near future, in the year 2027. Russia has isolated itself from Europe and the Caucasus by building a great wall. &quot;Bit by bit, Russia is slipping back into an authoritarian empire&quot;, Sorokin has prophesied in an interview.  The title of the book refers to <A HREF="alesol.htm">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</A>'s novel <I>Odin Den' Ivana Denisovicha</I>  (1962). 
Sorokin wrote his book in a month, in a burst of creative energy. </P>
<P>In the 1990s and early 2000s Sorokin wrote screenplays for such films as 
<I>Moskva</I>, directed by Alexander Zeldovich, <I>Kopeyka</I> and <I>Veshch</I>, 
directed by Ivan Dykhovichnyj, and <I>4</I>, a surrealistic tale filled with 
hypnotic long takes and  images of decay and waste. This film, directed by Il'ia 
Khrzhanovskii who refused to cut it any shorter, illustrates some of Sorokin's 
favorite themes, such as cloning and food, but it is also a fierce attack on 
traditional Russian mentality represented by &quot;babushkas&quot; (old women), whose 
sexual needs Khrzhanovskii  observes with almost anthropological detachment. 

Sorokin's opera libretto <I>Deti Rozentalya</I> (2005, The Children of Rosenthal), commissioned by the Bolshoi Theater, was labelled by a member of the State Duma as &quot;pornography&quot; and the cultural committee of the Duma was ordered   to review the opera. Sorokin's libretto tells the story of five cloned classical composers who have fallen on hard times. They drink poisoned vodka; only Mozart survives. </P>
<P>Sorokin's most famous and controversial novel  is the science-fiction story <I>Goluboe Salo </I>(1999, Blue Lard). The title of the book refers to a special substance, blue fat or lard, which cloned humanlike creatures produce when they write and which is used as  fuel. &quot;Blue&quot; is also a slang term for &quot;gay man&quot;. A scene, in which the clones of the former Soviet rulers  Josef Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev (&quot;Count Khrushchev&quot;) have a homosexual encounter, was considered by the pro-Putin youth movement Idu&#154;cie vmeste (Walking Together)  particularly offensive. &quot;Khrushchev unbuttoned his own pants and took out his long, uneven penis with its bumpy head, its shiny skin tattooed with a pentacle. The count spat in his palm, lubricated Stalin's anus with his saliva, and, falling upon him from behind, started to thrust his penis softly into the leader.&quot; <FONT SIZE="2">(</FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">International Exposure: Perspectives on Modern European Pornography</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, 1800-2000 by Lisa Z. Sigel</FONT><FONT SIZE="2">,  2005, </FONT><FONT SIZE="2">p. 232</FONT><FONT SIZE="2">)</FONT> Pornography charges, which later were dropped, were brought against Vladimir Sorokin and the publisher Ad Marginem. During a  protest in Moscow, members of the movement  dumped copies of the book in a mock toilet bowl<B> </B>in front of the Bolshoi Theatre. This manifestation of outrage was arranged nearly three years after the publication of the book, proving that pornography still has an ideological edge in Russia. Unnamed officials at the Moscow's prosecutor's office read the novel and released an announcement, that the Sorokin case was closed &quot;for lack of a criminal offense&quot;. To escape the campaign of harassment, Sorokin went with his wife to Estonia for a month. </P>

<P>Many of Sorokin's works show his fascination of cooking and eating and bodily fluids. <I>Pir</I> (2000) is a collection of stories that are thematically built around food, in <I>Norma </I>the characters are forced to consume their daily ration of shit, and in<I> Lyod </I>(2002, Ice), the first book of a  trilogy which continued with <I>Put' Bro</I> (2004) and <I>23000</I> (2005), blue-eyed, blond vegetarians kill people, &quot;empty dingalings&quot;, with hammers made of ice. Their mission is to hear the true speech of their captives' hearts. </P>
<P>Sorokin lives in Moscow. He received   in 2001 the National Booker Award and the Award of Andrey Beliy.   
Sorokin's works have been translated into some twenty languages. In 2011 
he traveled to the US to appear at the PEN World Voices Festival in New York City.
