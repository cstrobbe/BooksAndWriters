<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American popular novelist and essayist, forgotten 
agrarian reformer who won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel<em> Early Autumn </em>(1926), a portrait of an old New England family. Many of Bromfield's 
novels have rural setting and have strongly American atmosphere, although 
he set some of his stories in India. One of the central themes in 
Bromfield's work is the contrast between city and the country &#8211; he saw his 
own farm as a refuge from the mechanized world, but it also was a meeting place for a number of his friends. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The long journey across the burning,
dusty plateau became suddenly a kind of nightmare, possessed only of
the reality of dreams. It seemed now to belong to the remote past. Only
the future existed. In her health and vitality, the aura of past
experiences, however bad, never clung to her. The past had the power do
depress you only if you were ill or tired. Hope, optimism, anticipation
she knew, out of experience and instinct, were the rewards of health
and vitality."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Night in Bombay</font></i><font size="2">, 1940) </font></blockquote>

<p>Louis Bromfield was born in Mansfield, Ohio, on a farm. He studied
at Cornell Agricultural College in 1914-15 and journalism in 1916 at
Columbia University, receiving honorary war degree in 1920. After the
United States declared war on Germany in the World War I Bromfield
joined the American Ambulance Corps, with the 34th and 168th divisions
of the French Army. He served in the army from 1917 to 1919 and was
decorated for his services. Bromfield then returned to journalism in
New York. He wrote critics for several periodicals, among them the <i>Bookman</i> and<i> Time</i> 
magazine. He also worked as an assistant to theatrical producer and as 
advertising manager. In 1921 he married Mary Appleton Wood; they had three daughters. She died in 1952. </p>

<p>After publishing <em>The Green Bay Tree </em>(1924), set in a small
town in Ohio, Bromfield devoted himself entirely to writing. He moved
with his wife and daughter to France, where he first stayed at the
Hôtel de l'Odéon (a.k.a. Hôtel Regnard). In addition to residing in
this hotel, where Sherwood Anderson took a room during his visit in
Paris in 1926, the Bromfields rented quarters for a period of time on
the boulevard Flandrin. It was a large glass apartment overlooking the
Bois. Bromfield noted that he was "regarded, with the Fitzgeralds, as
vulgar for liking heat and bathrooms." Later they settled in Senlis, an
ancient village north of Paris. Bromfield's second novel proved to be
such a financial success that he was able to lease an old Presbytère,
which had once been the dwelling place of Capuchin monks. There
Bromfield created a garden, which became famous for its hybrid musk
roses and lilies. This rural estate was his primary residence for
nearly a dozen years. <br>
 </p><p>In 1932 Bromfield visited India. The journey inspired his most famous 
book, <em>The Rains Came </em>(1937),
which has been adapted to screen twice. Clarence Brown's version from
1939, starring Myrna Loy, George Brent, and Tyrone Power, is consided
slick Hollywood film-making at its professional best. The story is set
in Ranchipur and portrays the destinies of a large number of people
against monsoon rains and the bursting of a dam. Bromfield's view of
the decadent Europeans is seen in the character of Ransome, who is
contrasted with awakening India symbolized by the Maharajah. </p>

<p>In France in the '20s, Bromfield helped 
<a href="hemingwa.htm">Ernest Hemingway</a> first get published, and he 
was compared favorably with Fitzgerald, Thurber and Steinbeck, among 
others. In 1931 he met <a href="wharton.htm">Edith Wharton</a>
(1862-1937), with whom he shared a passion for gardening. Their
correspondence was published in 1999. Bromfield and Wharton seldom
discussed their writing but they&nbsp;talked frequently and at great
lenght of their dahlias and petunias, and their green peas and
lettuces. Bromfield learned much of his gardening from
her.&nbsp;Bromfield took Wharton to visit a local dahlia-grower, who
was a fervent communist and had named his favorite species after Henri
Barbusse. She ordered from him dahlias which she never lived to see in
flower. </p><p>During these expatriate years Bromfield wrote his most highly 
acclaimed novels, including <em>Early Autumn. The Farm </em>(1933)
spanned a period of about 100 years and depicted the conflict between
the agricultural and the industrial way of life through the experience
of several generations.&nbsp;<em>A&nbsp;Good Woman</em>&nbsp;(1927) told a story of a mother, who thinks herself 
good and righteous, but ruins her son's life. Bromfield once said that he wrote "the Victorian novel with trimmings."</p>
<p>In the late 1930s Bromfield moved back to the United States, to his childhood surroundings in Ohio. "I 
was sick of the troubles, the follies, and the squabbles of the Europe which I had known and loved so long," 
he confessed in&nbsp;<em>From My Experience</em>&nbsp;(1955). "I wanted peace and I wanted roots for the rest of my life." 
He settled near Lucas, 
where he had the most famous experimental farm of the postwar years. Bromfield found it in January 1939, 
when he turned the corner of the road into Pleasant Valley and saw that valley after twenty-five years under 
deep snow. Bromfield's six-hundred-acre Malabar Farm was visited by such famous 
actors as Humphrey Bogart, 
who loved to drink and argue with writers, and Lauren Bacall &#8211; they were married there in 
1945; Bromfield was best man. As a wedding gift he gave them a boxer puppy. 
Bromfield was more conservative than Bogart, who was a supporter of Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt and later Adlai Stevenson. When Bromfield visited Bogart in Los Angeles, 
their debates often ended in dissention on political questions. However, 
Bacall described Bromfield as "one of Bogie's oldest and best friends." They had 
known each other since the 1920s, when they had worked in the New York theater world. 
Bromfield also wrote the story 'Better Than Life' for the Humphrey 
Bogart film <i>It All Came True</i> (1940). </p>
<p>Bromfield received several awards and honors, among them LL.D. from 
Marshall College, Huntington, West Virginia, LL.D. from Parsons College, 
Fairfield, Iowa, D.Litt. from Ohio Northern University, and Chevalier, 
Légion d'honneur (1939). He was President of Emergency Committee for 
the American Wounded in Spain in 1938 and the director of the United 
States Chamber of Commerce. Bromfield died on March 18, 1956 in Columbus, Ohio. His later works 
include <em>Pleasant Valley (</em>1945), a personal statement with an ecological 
theme, <em>Until the Day Break </em>(1942), a spy story, set against occupied 
Paris in the 1940s, and<em> Wild Is The River </em>(1941), a romantic historical 
novel about the American Civil War, which&nbsp;was set against the background of the 
occupation of New Orleans by the Yankees. <em>Brigham Young - Frontiersman</em>
(1940), filmed by Henry Hathaway, was a fictionalized part-biography of
the Mormon leader who founded the Salt Lake City. Dean Jagger played
the title role. The&nbsp;screen version&nbsp;was less concerned with
the religious aspects, but focused on the theme of the persecution of a
minority and the pioneering story in the Fordian vein. </p>

<p>The author's daughter Ellen has depicted in <i>The Heritage: A 
Daughter's Memories of Louis Bromfield </i>(1995)
her life growing up in the shadow of her famous father. "His was a
vital character, energetic, ambitious, insatiably curious about every
human being, every manner of living," she wrote. "To be surrounded
constantly by an assortment of human samples from as many walks of life
as possible was, indeed, an obsession with him." In <i>Strangers in the Valley</i> 
(1957) Ellen Bromfield Carson drew a picture how she and her husband 
Carson moved to Brazil to live a farm life on the new 
frontier there. Louis Bromfield's Malabar Farm has become a popular tourist attraction 
in Ohio, receiving visitors from all parts of the world. </p>
