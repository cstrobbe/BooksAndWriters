<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Journalist, polemical critic,
poet, and novelist, whose avant-garde polemics made him one of the most
controversial Italian literary figures in the early and mid-20th
century. Giovanni Papini advocated breaking with tradition and defering
to the new generation, but after World War II he lost his influence as
an opinion leader. His ideological development was full of paradoxes:
he was first an anti-nationalist, then a staunch nationalist; first an
agnostic, but then turned to Roman Catholicism. He wrote both a life of
Christ and a history of the Devil. Papini published over eighty books
on philosophy, theory and literary criticism, as well as novels and
short stories. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I did not accept reality. No words
can express my disgust at the physical, human, rational world, which
suppressed me and did not leave room and air enough for my restless
wings." </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Un uomo finito</font></i><font size="2">, 1912) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Giovanni Papini was born in Florence of lower middle class
parents. From an early age he devoted himself to literature. Of
himself, Papini once said, "Everybody knows, his friends with even more
certainly than his enemies, that he is the ugliest man in Italy (if
indeed he deserves the name of man at all), so repulsive that Mirabeau
would seem in comparison an academy model, a Discobolus, an Apollo
Belvedere. And since the face is the mirror of the soul . . . no one
will be surprised to learn that Papini is the scoundrel of literature,
the blackguard of journalism, the Barabbas of art, the thug of
philosophy, the bully of politics, the Apaché of culture..." </p>
      <p>Papini read widely from his grandfather's library and at the
age of 15 started to write an encyclopedia. He also frequented the same
Beltrami bookstore on Via dei Martrelli than Ardengo Soffici, with whom
he later edited <i>Lacerba</i>. After attending Norman School in
Florence, Papini received his teacher's certificate around 1900.
Although Papini adopted militaristic views, he was exempted from
military service on grounds of health. He urged the establishing in
Rome of a new world power, and the abandonment of the "politics of
meditation" (<i>Il Leonardo</i>, August, 1906). In 1907, Papini married
Giacinta Giovagnoli, a peasant girl. They he had two daughters, Viola
and Gioconda. </p>
      <p>At the age of 22 Papini's writing aspirations led him into
contact with other young writers and artists. As a meeting place they
used the Café Giubbe Rosse in Piazza della Repubblica. With Giuseppe
Prezzolini he founded and managed the influential but short-lived
Florentine magazine <i>Il Leonardo</i> (1903-07) and <i>La Voce</i>.
It attempted to modernize Italian culture, introduced significant
French, British, and American ideas, and attacked such traditionalist
as <a href="dannun.htm">D'Annunzio</a>. Papini boldly argued, that one
must write badly, meaning that the artistic form is secondary to the
idea. Among his other targets was the positivist philosophy, which was
gaining ground in Italy. For Papini, pragmatism offered a liberative
tool from orthodoxies. Mussolini&nbsp;once said, that <em>Leonardo</em>
and <em>La Voce</em> were lying at the core of his own
political-cultural formation. However, when Papini celebrated&nbsp;the
Libyan war in 1911, Mussolini was sentenced to imprisonment for his
opposition to it. </p>
      <p>In the 1910s, Papini joined the Futurist artistic movement,
which admired the dynamic energy of modern machines. To
further&nbsp;its aims, Papini launched in 1913 the journal <i>Lacerba</i>.
"... a new beauty... a roaring motorcar, which runs like a machine-gun,
is more beautiful than the Winged Victory of Samothrace... We wish to
glorify war," <font size="2"><font size="3">Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</font>
      </font>
wrote &nbsp;in an article in <i>Le Figaro</i>. The English painter and
poet, Mina Loy (1882-1966), had brief affairs with both Marinetti and
Papini. Her poem 'The Effectual Marriage' satirized gendered division
of work through the characters of "Miovanni" and "Gina"; Miovanni's
place in the library and Gina is in her kitchen: "To man his work / to
woman her love".
&nbsp;Turning against&nbsp;Marinetti's growing influence in the
movement, Papini made a distinction between Florentine Futurism
and&nbsp;"Marinettism", which&nbsp;stood for ignorance, militarism,
chauvinism, and contempt for women. </p>
      <p>Papini had been a severe critic of Christianity in his youth,
but was converted to Roman Catholicism in 1920. He then gained
international fame with his religious novel <em>Storia di Cristo</em>
(1921). Its English translation, <i>The Life of Christ</i>, was a huge
bestseller in 1923, with such works as H.G. Wells's <i>The Outline of
History</i> and Sinclair Lewis's novel <i>Babbitt</i>. </p>
      <p>Among his other popular works is the autobiographical novel <em>Un
uomo finito</em> (1912). It draws a portrait of a restless intellectual
and his deep dissatisfaction with contemporary philosophical debate and
intellectual mediocrity. Also in many of his short stories Papini
himself is the main character. In one story the author meets himself as
the young man he was a
nd whom he only vaguely remembers; in another he continues to live
after his suicide in order to pay a minor debt. The young Mussolini
read the book, and found Papini's philosophy of action admirable. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am not a real man. I am not a
man like others, a man of flesh and blood, a man born of woman. I did
not come into this world like your fellow men. No one rocked me in my
cradle, or watched over my growing years. I have not known the
restlessness of adolescence, or the comfort of family ties. I am &#8211; and
I will say this out loud though perhaps you may not want to believe
me&nbsp;&#8211; I am but a figure in a dream. In me, Shakespeare's image has
become literally and tragically exact: I am such stuff as dreams are
made on! I exist because someone is dreaming of me, someone who is now
asleep and dreaming and sees me act and live and move, and in this very
moment is dreaming that I am saying these words."</b> (in 'The Sick
Gentleman's Last Visit') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Papini's loyalty to Mussolini was recognized officially in
1939 when he was honored with the title "Accademico d'Italia." A few
years earlier Papini had published <em>Storia della letteratura
italiana</em>&nbsp; (1937), which was dedicated "To the Duce, friend of
poetry and poets." The ambitious literary history dealt with the 13th
and 14th centuries and never proceeded further. Papini's interest not
only in contemporary affairs was already seen in <em>L'uomo Carducci</em>
(1918), a sympathetic portrait of the poet-critic Giosuè Carducci
(1835-1907). </p>
      <p>While Italy's popular literature churned out predictable
portrayals of "money grabbing" Jewish businessmen, Papini developed his
own vision of the world Jewish conspiracy, set out to destroy
Catholicism and to undermine the prevailing order of the world system.
This idea permeated even his <em>Dizionario dell'omo salvatico</em>
(1923), jointly authored with the Jesuit thinker Domenico Giuliotti. In
the dictionary, Jewish figures are treated as enemies of Catholicism.
Moreover, the Jews themselves are responsible for anti-Semitism: "This
race at once divine and filthy, whose punishment consists in the
obligation to punish Christians, has vanquished all peoples among which
it dwells to such an extent that this race had become one of the
dominat nations of the earth even though it has no land of its own." At
a meeting of the Royal Academy in 1939 Papini criticized an unnamed
French Jewish literaryn critic for having questioned the "Italianness"
of <a href="leopard.htm">Leopardi</a>. According to Papini, Leopardi
represented poetry and youth, and it&nbsp;was "precisely for this that
Fascist Italy has honored and honors the ever young Italian poet
Giacomo Leopardi." </p>
      <p>Papini's notorious satirical novel <em>Gog </em>(1931)
became a bestseller and was played on radio. "There are no fewer than
seventy short chapters of very unequal merit, which hardly qualify the
author to be ranked amongst the greatest satirists of the day", said
one reviewer in <i>the Evening Post</i>. The central character&nbsp;is
an eccentric Hawaiian-American millionaire, Goggins, who moves from one
private lunatic asylum to another around the world in search of
knowledge. One the Jews in the book, named Benrubi, explains: "As
capitalists we dominate the world financial markets in a time in which
the economy is everything or almost everything; as thinkers we dominate
intellectual markets, causing old sacred and profane faiths to crumble
and both revealed religions and secular religions to be reduced to
dust." In 1935 Papini was appointed Professor of Italian language at
the University of Bologna; it was the same chair that the poet and
Nobel laureate Giosuè Carducci had occupied. However, because of an eye
illnes, he was forced to relinquish the chair. From 1938 he published
the magazine <i>La Rinascita</i>. </p>
      <p>After WW II Papini founded with Silvano Gianelli and Adolfo
Oxilia the avant-garde Catholic review <i>L'Ultima</i>. Papini's
reputation as an iconoclast faded during his last years. In 1952 Papini
was stricken by illness that progressively paralyzed his hands and
voice, but he continued to write.<em> Il Diavolo</em> (1953) showed his
strong Catholic commitment. <em>Il libro nero </em>
(1951) was presented in the form of Gog's diary, which contained fake
interviews with such figures as Hitler, Dali, and Picasso; Picasso's
interview was circulated in some other publications as authentic,
including the confession: "I am only a public entertainer who has
understood his times and exploited as best he could the imbecility, the
vanity, the cupidity of his contemporaries." Papini died rather
suddenly on July 8, 1956. </p>

model social and political ideas. In rebel against tradition, poets
