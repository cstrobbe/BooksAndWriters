<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->German essayist, cultural critic, and
novelist, who was awarded
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929. Among Mann's most famous works
is <span style="font-style: italic;">Buddenbrooks</span> (1901), which
appeared when he was 26. He began writing it during a one-year stay in
Italy and completed it in about two and a half years. The book outraged
the citizens of Lübeck, who saw it as a thinly veiled account of local
incidents and figures, although Mann never mentions the name of the
city. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A man lives not only his personal
life, as an individual, but also, consciously or unconsciously, the
life of his epoch and his contemporaries."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Magic Mountain</font></i><font size="2">, 1924) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Paul Thomas Mann was born in Lübeck, where he was baptized as
a Protestant in St. Mary's Church. He was the son of a wealthy father,
Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann, who owned a grain firm and was elected the
senator overseeing taxes for Lübeck. Mann's mother Julia, née da
Silva-Bruhns, came from a German-Portugese-Creole family. After Mann's
father died in 1891, his trading firm was dissolved, and the family
moved to Munich. Mann was educated at the Lübeck gymnasium
and he also spent some time at the University of Munich. He then worked
for the south German Fire Insurance Company for a short period. Mann's
career as a writer started in the magazine <i>Simplicissimus</i>.
Mann's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Der kleine Herr
Friedmann</span>, came out in 1898. </p>
      <p>While at university, Mann became immersed in the writings of
the
philosophers Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche as well as
in the music of composer Richard Wagner. In <i>Buddenbrooks, </i>Mann's
early masterpiece, he used the technique of the <i>leitmotif</i>,
which
he adapted from Wagner. Mann had started the book in 1897 as a small
story about one member
of the family. However, the "protracted finger practice with no
ulterior advantages" enlarged into a saga
of a wealthy Hanseatic family, which declines from strength to
decadence.
The last Buddenbrook, the musically gifted young Hanno who dies of a
typhoid infection; he is the first of many similar, often morally
suspect aesthetes in Mann's novels, continuing in Tonio Kröger, Gustav
Aschenbach, Felix Krull, and Adrian Lewerkühn.</p>
      <p>After <i>Buddenbrooks</i>, Mann concentrated on short novels
or novellas. In 1902 he published <span style="font-style: italic;">Tonio
Kröger</span>, a spiritual autobiography exploring art and discipline.
He married in 1905
Katja Pringsheim, the daughter of a wealthy Munich family; they had a
total six children over the ensuing years. <span style="font-style: italic;">Königliche Hoheit</span> (1909, Royal
Highness) reflected Mann's views of duty and sacrifice.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Der Tod in Venedig</span> (1912, Death in
Venice), Mann's famous multilayered novella, was inspired by a young,
sailor-suited boy, Wladyslaw Moes, to son of Baron Moes, whom the
author saw in Venice in 1911. Later in life Wladyslaw remembered "the
old man", who had been watching him, and noticed after reading the
story in Polish translation, how accurately Mann had described his
linen suit and his favorite jacket. Other characters have also their
counterparts in real life. However, Tadzio in the book is 14, but
Wladyslaw was actually ten and a half. In the story an author, Gustav
von Aschenbach, whose character is said to be based on the composer
Gustav Mahler, fells hopelessly in love with a young teenager, Tadzio.
Obsessed with the boy, he stays in Venice during a cholera epidemic,
and also dies of cholera. The story was adapted into screen by Luchino
Visconti, starring Dirk Bogarde and Bjorn Andresen. As a theme Visconti
used the Adagietto from Mahler's Fifth Symphony. </p>
      <p>During World War I Mann supported Kaiser's policy and attacked
liberalism. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Von Deutscher Republik</span>
(1923), as a semi-official spokesman for parliamentary democracy, he
called the German intellectuals to support the new Weimar state. </p>
      <p>After ten years of work Mann completed his second major work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Der Zauberberg</span> (1924, The Magic
Mountain), a novel about ideas and of lost humanism. It depicted again
a fight between liberal and conservative values, enlightened civilized
world and
nonrational beliefs. Hans Castorp, the protagonist, goes to the elegant
tuberculosis sanatorium in Davos, to visit his cousin. Castorp is not
really ill, but he stays
for a period of seven years, and undergoes an advanced education on the
Magic Mountain, primarily through speaking and listening. Two men
struggle for his soul, Settembrini,
an Italian humanist, and Naptha (see: <a href="lukacs.htm">Georg Lukacs</a>),
a radical reactionary, who speaks of blind and irrational
faith. Naptha cries out a prophecy that came true in Germany only a
decade after publication of the book: "No!" Naphta continued. "The
mystery and precept of our age is not liberation and the development of
the ego. What our age needs, what it demands, what it will create for
itself, is <font face="Symbol">-</font> terror." Naphta challenges
Settembrini to a duel with pistols. Settembrini fires into the air,
Naphta kills himself in a rage. Another weird character is Mynheer
Peeperkorn, who arrives at the Mountain in the company of the beautiful
Claudia Chauchat. Castorp falls in love with her at first sight.
Claudia returns to Peeperkorn, and Castorp yearns her deeply. The
vitalistic Peeperkorn, who confronts his own impotence, also kills
himself. Castorp leaves the sanatorium to join the army at the
outbreak of the war. Mann tells the reader that while the young man's
chances of survival are not good, the question must be left open.</p>
      <p>Mann's next major work was <span style="font-style: italic;">Joseph
und seine Brüder</span> (1933-42, Joseph and his Brothers),
set in the biblical world. The story about the conflict between
personal freedom and political tyranny was based on Genesis 12-50. The
first volume recounts the early history
of Jacob, and introduces then Joseph, the central character. He is sold
to the Egypt, where he refuses Potiphar's advances and gains her
enmity. Joseph develops into a wise man and the savior of his
people.
      </p>
      <p> During the writing process of <i>Joseph and his Brothers</i>
the political control in Germany was seized by the Nazis. On Hitler's
accession to power, Mann moved to Switzerland, where he edited the
literary journal <i>Mass und Wert</i>. He settled finally in the
United States in 1936, working among others at the University of
Princeton.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Lotte in Weimar</span>
(1939, The Beloved Returns) focused on the world of Goethe's novel <i>The
Sorrows of Young Werther (</i>1774). In 1941 Mann moved to Santa
Monica, California.
He lived in the U.S. some ten years, but was disappointed with the
American persecution of Communist sympathizers. The Manns were frequent
visitors to Salka Viertel&#8217;s Santa Monica salon. Her Sunday tea parties
were also attended by Bertolt and Helli Brecht, Bruno and Liesel Frank,
and various other intellectuals exiled from Nazi Germany. </p>
      <p>Mann admired greatly Russian literature and wrote several
essays about on Leo Tolstoy and his "undying realism." Especially he
loved Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i>. However, he disliked the later
Tolstoy and considered him less noble than Goethe. In the essay
'Dostoevsky - With Moderation' (1945) he deals with the author's
supposed confession to Turgenev that he had violated an underage girl.
René Wellek has dismissed Mann's speculations and considers the whole
business of Dostoevsky's criminality totally misconceived <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">A History of Modern Criticism</font></i><font size="2">, vol. 7, 1991). </font></p>
      <p>Mann's last great work was <span style="font-style: italic;">Doktor
Faustus</span> (1947), the story of composer Adrian Lewerkühn and the
progressive destruction of German culture in the two World Wars. In the
background of the story was the innovative 12-tone music of Arnold
Schönberg. Mann's account of the genesis of <i>Doctor Faustus </i>appeared
in 1949. (Faust theme / Pact with the Devil, see <a href="/goethe.htm">J.W.
Goethe</a>.)
After lung cancer operation Mann returned in 1947 to
Europe. Demonstratively he avoided Germany, but he was made an honorary
citizen of his hometown of Lübeck and he supported the rebuilding of
its Marienkirche. Mostly Mann lived in
Switzerland, near Zürich, where he died on August 12, 1955. Mann's
parodic and light-hearted novel <i>Confessions of Felix Krull </i>was
left unfinished. </p>
