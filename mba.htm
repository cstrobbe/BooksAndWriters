<p>Senegalese teacher and writer, whose epistolary novel <i>Une
si longue lettre</i> (1980, So Long a Letter) is considered the
classical statement of the female condition in Africa. The book won the
first Noma Award for Publishing in Africa at the 1980 Frankfurt Book
fair, and made Bâ at her 50s world famous. Central themes in the novel
are male-female relations in patriarchal society, and the tradition of
polygamy and its effects on modern African family. "Books are a
weapon," Bâ once said, "a peaceful weapon perhaps, but they are a
weapon." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The power of books, this marvelous
invention of astute human intelligence. Various signs associated with
sound: different sounds that form the word. Juxtaposition of words from
which springs the idea, Thought, History, Science, Life. Sole
instrument of interrelationship and of culture, unparalleled means of
giving and receiving. Books knit generations together in the same
continuing effort that leads to progress. They enabled you to better
yourself. What society refused you, they granted..."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">So Long a Letter</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Mariama Bâ was born into a well-to-do family in Dakar, where
she grew up. In the newly independent Senegal, Bâ's father became one
of the first ministers of state. After Bâ's mother died, she was raised
in the traditional manner by her maternal grandparents. Her early
education she received hin French, while at the same time attending
Koranic school. <br>
</p>
<p>At school Bâ was a prominent student. During the colonial
period and later, girls faced a number of obstacles when they wanted to
have a higher education. Bâ's grandparents did not plan to educate her
beyond primary school, but her father's insistence on giving her an
opportunity to continue her studies eventually prevailed. She won the
first prize in the entrance examination and entered the Ecole Normale
de Rufisque, a teacher training college near Dakar. During this period
she published her first book. It was non-fiction and dealt with
colonial education in Senegal. At school she also wrote an essay, which
created a stir for its rejection of French policies in Africa. However,
later in life Bâ recalled her experience with the French colonial
educational system in a positive way. </p>
<p>After graduating in 1947, Bâ worked as an elementary-school
teacher, married a politician, Obèye Diop, and had nine children. After
twelve years, she was forced to resign due to poor health, and she then
worked as a regional school inspector. When her marriage broke up, Bâ
raised the children alone. A divorcee and "a modern Muslim woman" as
she characterized herself, Bâ was active in women's associations,
promoted education, championed women's rights, made speeches, and wrote
articles in local newspapers. After a long illness, Bâ died of cancer
in 1981, six months after <i>So Long a Letter </i>won the Noma Award
for Literature.<i> Scarlet Song</i>, about the marriage between a
European woman and an African man, was published posthumously. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As a writer, Bâ emerged from the
oral tradition of the Senegalese griot women and wrote a "speakerly
text." This tradition of orality in Senegal has been the major outlet
for women's voices. The griot women &#8211; not controlled by society in ways
other women are regarding speech &#8211; are given a license by society to
say whatever they want without censorship. The tradition of the griot
women is important to the Senegalese women, because it has always been
one way of making themselves heard and listened to."</b> (Siga Fatima
Jagne, in </font><i><font size="2">Postcolonial African Writers</font></i><font size="2">, ed. Pushpa Naidu Parekh and Siga Fatima Jagne, 1998)</font></blockquote>
<p>Although Aminata Sow Fall's work <i>Le Revenant</i> from 1976
was the first novel by a woman to appear in Senegal, <i>So Long a
Letter</i> is widely considered one of the first female-authored
francophone novels structured around modern feminist themes. The book
is structured in the form of a letter, or diary, from a widow,
Ramatoulaey, to her childhood girlfriend, Aissatou, who lives in the
United States. As in the works of the Senegalese woman writer
Nafissatou Diallo (1941-1982), who began her career in the 1970s, Bâ's
protagonist is a strong-willed character, who finds support from
women's solidarity. Aissatou's example inspires Ramatoulaey, who must
in her own life deal with the consequences of polygamy. Through the
character of Ramatoulaey, Bâ questioned the ideology of the founding
fathers of Négritude, especially way male writers had mythologized the
"femine."&nbsp; </p>
<p>The story begins with the stressing of the seriousness of the
subject, which has prompted Ramatoulaey to write to her friend. Her
husband, Modou Fall, has died but she considers it divine will. After
25 years of marriage, her husband had married the friend of his
daughter, Binetou. For a moment Ramatoulaey thinks of leaving him but
then decides to stay in her marriage, preparing for equal sharing,
according to the precepts of Islam concerning polygamic life. Modou
avoids her, and spends his money on Binetou. Ramatoulaey fills her days
with female duties, she purchases basic foodstuffs, she takes care of
the house, pays electricity bills, and she also overcomes her shyness
and goes alone to cinemas. Ramatoulaey does not reject the Islamic
faith <font face="Symbol">-</font> "my heart concurs with the demands
of religion," she confesses. When her daughters want to wear trousers,
she first condemns the idea: "Trousers accentuate the ample figure of
the black woman and further emphasize the curve of the small of the
back." </p>
<p>Bâ juxtaposes male behavior based on sexual instincts and
female continence and rationality. Mawdo, whom Assatou had married and
left, defends polygamy and tells of a film in which the survivors of an
air crash ate the flesh of the corpses to stay alive. "You can't resist
the imperious laws that demand food and clothing for man. The same laws
compel the 'male' in other respects. I say 'male' to emphasize the
bestiality of instincts..." Ramatoulaey later warns her daughter that
the existence of means of contraception should not lead to an
unhindered release of desires and instincts. "It is through his
self-control, his ability to reason, to choose, his power to
attachment, that the individual distinguishes himself from the animal."
<i>So Long a Letter</i> has been translated into more than a
dozen languages, including Finnish. </p>
<p>Bâ's <i>Scarlet Song</i>, about the difficulties of
interracial marriage, also gained international attention. Mireille,
the daughter of a French diplomat, marries Ousmane, the son of a poor
Senegalese family and a Moslem. They move from Paris to Senegal, where
Ousmane again adopts the traditions of his family and the community.
Mireille, a Western educated white woman, brings with her a conflict
into the family. When Ousmane takes a second wife, Mireille breaks
down. Through the fate of the French heroine Bâ shows that an
individual cannot change unless traditional features of the Muslim
society, such as polygamy and subjugation of women, are changed. </p>
