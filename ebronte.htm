<P>Perhaps the greatest writer of the three Bront&euml; sisters – <A href="cbronte.htm">Charlotte</A>, Emily and <A href="abronte.htm">Anne</A>. Emily Bront&euml; published only one novel, <EM>Wuthering Heights</EM> (1847), a story of the doomed love and revenge. The sisters also published jointly a volume of verse, <EM>Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell</EM>. Only two copies of the book was sold.</P>

<P>Emily Bront&euml; was born in Thornton, Yorkshire, in the north of England. Her father, 
the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;, had moved from Ireland to Weatherfield, in Essex, where he taught in Sunday school. 
Eventually he settled in Yorkshire, the centre of his life's work. In 1812 he married Maria Branwell of Penzance. 
Patrick Bront&euml; loved poetry, he published several books of prose and verse and wrote to local newspapers. 
In 1820 he moved to Hawort, a poverty-stricken little town at the edge of a large tract of moorland, where he served 
as a rector and chairman of the parish committee. </P>
<P>The lonely purple moors became one of the most important shaping forces in the life of the Bront&euml; sisters. 
 Their parsonage home, a small house, was of grey stone, two stories high. 
The front door opened almost directly on to the churchyard. In the upstairs was two bedrooms and a third room, 
scarcely bigger than a closet, in which the sisters played their games. 
 After their mother died in 1821, the children spent most 
of their time in reading and composition. To escape their unhappy 
childhood, Anne, Emily, Charlotte, and their brother Branwell (1817-1848)<FONT size=2> </FONT>created imaginary worlds – 
perhaps inspired by <A href="jswift.htm">Jonathan Swift</A>'s <I>Gulliver's Travels </I>(1726). 
Emily and Anne created their own Gondal saga, and Bramwell and Charlotte recorded 
their stories about the kingdom of Angria in minute notebooks. After failing as a paiter and writer, Branwell took to drink and opium, worked then as a tutor and assistant clerk to a railway company. In 1842 he was dismissed and joined his sister Anne at Thorp Green Hall as a tutor. His affair with his employer's wife ended disastrously. He returned to Haworth in 1845, where he rapidly declined and died three years later. 
</P>
<P>Between the years 1824 and 1825 Emily attended the school at Cowan Bridge with Charlotte, 
and then was largely educated at home. Her father's bookshelf offered a variety of 
reading: the Bible, Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Scott and many others. 
The children also read enthusiastically articles on current affairs and intellectual 
disputes in <I>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</I>, <I>F</I><I>raser's Magazine</I>, 
and <I>Edinburgh Review</I>. </P>


<P>In 1835 Emily Bront&euml; was at Roe Head. There she suffered from homesickness and returned after a few months to the 
moorland scenery of home. In 1837 she became a governess at Law Hill, near Halifax, where she spent six months. Emily 
worked at Miss Patchet's shdoll – according to Charlotte – "from six in the morning until near eleven at night, with only one half-hour of exercise between" and called it slavery. To facilitate their plan to keep school for girls, Emily and Charlotte Bront&euml; went in 1842 to Brussels to learn foreign languages and school management. Emily returned on the same year to Haworth. In 1842 Aunt Branwell died. When she was no longer taking care of the house and her brother-in-law, Emily agreed to stay with her father. </P>


<P>Unlike Charlotte, Emily had no close friends. She wrote a few letters and was interested in mysticism. Her first novel, <I>Wuthering Heights (1847)</I>, a story-within-a-story, did not gain immediate success as Charlotte's <I>Jane Eyre</I>, but it has acclaimed later fame as one of the most intense novels written in the English language. In contrast to Charlotte and Anne, whose novels take the form of autobiographies written by authoritative and reliable narrators, Emily introduced an unreliable narrator, Lockwood. He constantly misinterprets the reactions and interactions of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights. More reliable is Nelly Dean, the housekeeper, who has lived for two generations with the novel's two principal families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons. </P>
<P>Lockwood is a gentleman visiting the Yorkshire moors where the novel is set. At night Lockwood dreams 
of hearing a fell-fire sermon and then, awakening, he records taps on the window of his room. "... 
I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking through the window – terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless 
to attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on the broken pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood 
ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still it wailed, "Let me in!" and maintained its tenacious gripe, 
almost maddening me with fear." The hands belong to Catherine Linton, whose eerie appearance echo the 
violent turns of the plot. In a series of flashbacks and time shifts, Bront&euml; draws a powerful picture 
of the enigmatic Heathcliff, who is brought to Heights from the streets of Liverpool by Mr Earnshaw. 
Heathcliff is treated as Earnshaw's own children, Catherine and Hindley. After Mr. Earnshaw's death 
Heathcliff is bullied by Hindley and he leaves the house, returning three years later. Meanwhile 
Catherine marries Edgar Linton. Heathcliff 's destructive force is unleashed. Catherine dies 
giving birth to a girl, another Catherine. Heathcliff curses his true love:<B> </B>"... 
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living! You said I killed you – haunt me then!" Heathcliff 
marries Isabella Linton, Edgar's sister, who flees to the south from her loveless marriage. Their son Linton and 
Catherine are married, but the always sickly Linton dies. Hareton, Hindley's son, and the young widow became 
close. Increasingly isolated and alienated from daily life, Heathcliff experiences visions, and 
he longs for the death that will reunite him with Catherine. </P>
<P><I>Wuthering Heights </I>has been filmed several times. William Wyler's version from 1939, starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff, is considered on of the screen's classic romances. However, the English writer Graham Greene criticized the reconstructing of the Yorkshire moors in the Conejo Hills in California. "How much better they would have made <I>Wuthering Heights</I> in France," wrote Greene. "They know there how to shoot sexual passion, but in this Californian-constructed Yorkshire, among the sensitive neurotic English voices, sex is cellophaned; there is no egotism, no obsession.... So a lot of reverence has gone into a picture which should have been as coarse as a sewer." <FONT size=2>(</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Spectator</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, May 5, 1939)</FONT> Luis Bun&ntilde;uel set the events of the <I>amour fou</I> in an arid Mexican landscape. The music was based on melodies from <I>Tristan and Isolde</I> by Richard Wagner. </P>

<P>Emily Bront&euml; died of tuberculosis in the late 1848. She had caught cold at her brother Branwell's funeral in September. After the appearance of <I>Wuthering Heighs</I>, some skeptics maintained that the book was written by Branwell, on the grounds that no woman from such circumscribed life, could have written such passionate story. In 1848 Charlotte and Anne visited George Smith to reveal their identity and to help quell rumors that a single author lay behind the pseudonyms. After her sisters' deaths, Charlotte edited a second edition of their novels, with prefatory commentary aimed at correcting what she saw as the reviewers' misunderstanding of <I>Wuthering Heights</I>. The complex time scheme of the novel had been taken as evidence by the critics, that Emily had not achieved full formal control over her narrative materials. However, her model in layering narrative within narrative may have been <A href="mshelley.htm">Mary Shelley</A>'s <I>Frankenstein</I> (1818). Emily's refusal to reduce ambiguity to simplistic clarity did not have any immediate influence on the novel form until <A href="collins.htm">Wilkie Collins</A> experimented with multivocal first-person narratives in such works as <I>The Woman in White</I> (1860) and <I>The Moonstone</I> (1868).
