<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American cartoonist, novelist, playwright,
and screen writer. Feiffer's simple drawings have penetrated modern
life, politics and the strange habits of people and attracted attention
in newspapers and albums all over the world. His sparse style of
drawing has also given rise to numerous imitators. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The whole point to drawing was to make
it up out of your own imagination. Even Father and Indiana Jones was
made up. Father didn't say: "Draw me" to Jimmy. He would never have
said it. And Jimmy would never have done it, because why be an artist
if you are going to waste your talent drawing what was there in front
of your nose? It didn't make sense." </b>(from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man in the Ceiling</span>, 1993) </font></blockquote>
<p>Jules Feiffer was born in the Bronx, New York City, the son of David
Feiffer and Rhoda Davis Feiffer; they were both immigrant Jews. Rhoda
Davis was a fashion designer. "Since my father perennially failed at
business and his various other jobs didn&#8217;t last that long, it was my
mother&#8217;s three-dollar sketches that brought us through hard times," he
recalled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Backing Into Forward</span> (2010). 
 Feiffer began to draw at the age of 6. His early favorites were <i>Flash Gordon</i>, <i>Popeye</i>, and <i>Terry and the Pirates</i>. After studies 
at James Monroe High School, Feiffer entered the Art Students' League. "I was desperate to be a cartoonist." </p>
<p>From 1947 to 1951 Feiffer studied at the Pratt Institute while working as an assistant on Will Eisner's classical comic <i>The Spirit</i>. For the back page he created in 1949 his first own comic feature, <i>Clifford</i>. Feiffer has said that he grew up presuming the Spirit was Jewish. </p>
<p>During his army time Feiffer made animated cartoons for the Signal
Corps. "The army made a satirist out of me," Feiffer wrote in his
autobiography. "It didn't make a man of&nbsp; me, as promised by my
sergeants and lieutenants." After return to civilian life he worked at
several jobs. <i>Munro</i>, his long cartoon about a four-year-old boy
who gets drafted into the Army by mistake, arose partially as a
reaction authoritarian structures. <i>The Village Voice </i>began in
1956 to print Feiffer's political cartoons with their uniquely neurotic
characters of the Eisenhower-McCarthy Cold War era. The weekly comic
strip, usually six to eight panels, was first called <i>Sick Sick Sick</i>  with the subtitle <i>A Guide to Non-Confident Living</i>, and then <i>Feiffer</i>. </p>
<p>A number of protagonists appeared in the strip, but among the best
known are the modern dancer in black and Bernard Mergendeiler, a
victim-hero and psychological wreck devoured by tics and complexes,
whom Feiffer depicted with the undertones of self-hatred and self-pity.
Other characters are also more or less portrayed with black humour &#8211;
the spineless men and neurotic and poisonous women. In 1958 several of
the strips were published in book form under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Sick, Sick, Sick</span>.
Since then the strips have been reprinted in both hardbound and
paperback forms. Feiffer's comic strip antiheroes also appeared in a
play, <i>The Explainers</i>, staged at Chicago's Playwrights Cabaret in 1961.</p>
<p>Feiffer's other productions include a novel, illustrations to
children's books, and plays. In 1967 he gained fame with the musical
comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">Little Murders</span> (1968,
also made into film). The play ends with the Newquist family gunning
down passing pedestrians from their apartment window. However, he had
been active in the theatre for a long time, but his works were usually
short pieces in revue form. These include <span style="font-style: italic;">Crawling Around</span> (1961) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Only When I Laugh</span>&nbsp; (1967). <span style="font-style: italic;">The White House Murder Case </span>(1969)
dealt with violence and madness, shifting the scene between the White
House and a battlefield where American soldiers fight against Brazil.
In the fantasy comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">Knock Knock&nbsp;</span> (1976) Joan of Arc changes the lives of two elderly recluses. The 1976 Broadway production starred Lynn Redgrave as St. Joan. <span style="font-style: italic;">Grownups</span> (1981) was a marriage drama. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Carnal Knowledge </span>(1971),
for which Feiffer wrote the script, was banned in Georgia and
subsequently became an issue in the U.S. Supreme Court (1974). In the
film Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel are college seniors; their
adventures are partly based on the The Village Voice characters Bernard
and Huey. The film traces their sexual encounters from the repressive
'50s through the free-love '60s. Feiffer had been sceptical about the
star of <i>Easy Rider </i>playing Jonathan, a Jew from the Bronx, and
a womanizer who uses sexual conquest as a substitute for love. "The
first time I do it," says Nicholson, "I want her beautiful. I don't
want to waste it on some beast." The director said: "Believe me when I
say he's going to be the most important actor since Brando." In the end
of the film Nicholson is a nearly impotent chauvinist and Garfunkel a
middle-aged hippie. Feiffer was amazed at Nicholson's performance: "My
recollection is that Jack got all of the stuff on the first take.
Particularly, I remember watching the shacking-up scene. I couldn't
believe Jack's directness and simplicity and intelligence. He got
everything."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Jack's Life</font></i><font size="2"> by Patrick McGilligan, 1994) </font></p>
<p>Feiffer didn't want Nicholson for the role as a Jew from the Bronx,
as the part was originally written. Mike Nichols, the director, fought
Feiffer on the casting and finally convinced him to accept the actor.
Ann-Margaret won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her
portrayal of Bobbie. <span style="font-style: italic;">Popeye&nbsp;</span>
(1980) was based on characters created by E.C. Segar, the most famous
of which are a one-eyed, craggy-faced seadog named Popeye, J.
Willington Wimpy, who exhibited a love of hamburgers, Swee'pea,
Popeye's "adoptid infink", and Olive, his "sweet patootie". Feiffer's
animated cartoon Munro won an Academy Award in 1961. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Cartooning was supposed to be fun. If it
couldn't be fun, why do it? If it was going to be a job, like his
father's, why put up with it? What was the point of drawing cartoons
when the fun was left out?" </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Man in the Ceiling</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p>Feiffer's books for children include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man in the Ceiling</span> (1993), <span style="font-style: italic;">A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears </span>(1995), Meanwhile (1997), <span style="font-style: italic;">I Lost My Bear</span>&nbsp; (1998), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bark, George</span> (1999), originally written for his daughter Julie. <i>A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears </i>was
about a prince, Roger, whose sense of humor is too much for the king
and his wizard. Feiffer comments on Roger's adventures, and tells the
reader what will happen in the story. In T<i>he Man in the Ceiling</i>,
Feiffer returned to his own childhood feelings as an aspiring
cartoonist &#8211; the protagonist Jimmy Jibbett has devoted himself to
cartooning and has high hopes about his future. <i>I Lost My Bear</i>
tells of a little girl, who experiences adventures while searching for
her lost plaything. "The various sizes of Feiffer's hand-lettered
scrawls play a crucial part in creating the emotional atmosphere of
each scene. The tale is simple and universal enough for the youngest
listeners to chuckle over, but it will probably please older readers
too, even adults. For, as the recent narrowly averted international
Winnie-the-Pooh crisis demonstrates (the original stuffed animals were
threatened with leaving New York's Donnell Library Center and being
returned to England), the appeal of the bear has nothing to do with
age. Feiffer thus appears timely in topic and engagingly empathetic in
knowing that a teddy bear is far more than a plaything and that certain
children's toys are well aware of what is in the hearts of their
owners." <font size="2">(Krystyna Poray Goddu in <i>The New York Times</i>, May 17, 1998) </font></p>
<p>In 1961 Feiffer married Judith Sheftel, a film production and publishing executive. They had met through the British theatre critic Kenneth Tynan, hired by <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>
to review plays. The marriage ended in divorce in 1983. With his second
wife, the journalist Jenny Allen, Feiffer cooperated on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Long Chalkboard</span> (2006), for which he created the illustrations. </p>
<p>As political cartoonist Feiffer was particularly unyielding in his
attack on President Johnson's Vietnam politics and on Richard Nixon,
who was his most constant target. One strip showed President Johnson
looking from his Oval Office at peace demonstrators, who are dragged
away by the White House police. "Freedom of speech is one of our most
precious liberties," says the president. "Yes, Mr. President," answers
Dean Rusk. In 1986 Feiffer received the Pulitzer Prize in editorial
cartooning and in 2006 he was honored with the Benjamin Franklin
Creativity Laureate Award. After 40 years of work in <i>The Village Voice</i>,
Feiffer left the magazine in a salary dispute. Disillusioned with
political affairs, Feiffer stopped making political cartoons in the
late 1990s.</p>
