<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American poet, short story writer, critic
and novelist. Most of Aiken's work reflects his intense interest in
psychoanalysis and the development of identity. As editor of Emily
Dickinson's <i>Selected Poems</i> (1924) he was largely responsible
for establishing that poet's posthumous literary reputation. From the
1920s Aiken divided his life between England and the United States,
playing a significant role in introducing American poets to the British
audience.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"All lovely things will have an ending, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">All lovely things will fade and die, </font><br>
<font size="2">And youth, that's now so bravely spending, </font><br>
<font size="2">Will beg a penny and by." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'All Lovely Things Will Have an Ending,' 1916 ) </font></blockquote>
<p>Conrad Aiken was born in Savannah, Georgia, the first of three sons born to William Ford 
Aiken, a surgeon, and Anna Porter Aiken, the daughter of a Unitarian minister. 
In his childhood Aiken experienced a profound trauma when he found the bodies 
of his parents<font face="Symbol"> - </font>his
father, brilliant but unstable, had killed his mother and committed
suicide. When reaching the age of his father at the time of the
tragedy, Aiken had also difficulties in keeping his depression at bay.
In his "autobiographical narrative" <span style="font-style: italic;">Ushant: An Essay</span>
(1952), Aiken confessed that finding his parents dead, he "found
himself possessed of them forever". This prose work dramatized the
attempt of its protagonist, the author's persona, to read the
palimpsest of hieroglyphs that constitutes the landscape of his soul,
and mingled in between sketches of Malcolm Lowry, <a href="tseliot.htm">T.S. Eliot</a>, and other figures he knew. </p>
<p>Aiken was brought up in Massachusetts from the age of eleven by a
great-great-aunt. Before entering Harvard Aiken was educated at private
schools and at Middlesex School, Concord. In Harvard he shared a class
with T.S. Eliot, with whom he edited the <i>Advocate</i> and whose
poetry was to influence his own. Due to poor class attendance, he was
placed on academic probation. Aiken spent in Europe for half a year and
eventually graduated in 1912. After receiving the degree of A.B., Aiken
married Jessie McDonald, a graduate student from Canada; they had three
children. </p>
<p>After working as a reporter, Aiken devoted himself entirely to
writing, along with having a small private income. Of the many
influences Aiken acknowledged, the writings of Freud, Havelock Ellis,
William James, Edgar Allan Poe, and the French Symbolists are evident
in his work. Freud considered Aiken's second autobiographical novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Great Circle</span> (1933), a masterpiece of analytical introspection.</p>
<p>Aiken's first collection of verse, <span style="font-style: italic;">Earth Triumphant</span> (1914) made him known as a poet. He was a contributing editor to <i>Dial</i>, which led to a friendship with <a href="epound.htm">Ezra Pound</a>. Aiken's essays, collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Skepticisms</span> (1919) and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Reviewer's ABC</span> (1958), dealt with the questions provoked by his commitment to literature as a mode of self-understanding. </p>
<p>During the First World War Aiken claimed that he was in an
"essential industry" because of being a poet, and was granted an
exemption for this reason. Aiken's adult life was marked by
trans-Atlantic journeys. In 1921 he moved from Massachusetts to
England, settling in Rye, Sussex, where Jessie gave birth to their
third children. At that time Aiken's marriage began to fall apart; they
divorced in 1929, and Jessie married the poet's friend Martin
Armstrong. </p>
<p>In 1927-28 Aiken was a tutor in English at Harvard. His second wife was Clarissa M. Lorenz, a musician and journalist.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Blue Voyage</span>
(1927), dedicated to C.M.L. caught the attention of Malcolm Lowry, who
tought that it meant himself. He wrote a letter to Aiken, who become
his tutor and friend. They composed also together a poem for <i>The Festival Theatre Review</i> protesting the censorship of literature. </p>
<p>During his stay in Rye, Aiken produced his famous preludes, collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Preludes for Memnon </span>(1931) and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Time in the Rock</span>
(1936). There was also a suicide attempt in 1932. He sailed again for
Boston in 1933, and then spent two years in Rye (1934-36), writing
'London Letters' to the <i>New Yorker</i>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Preludes for Memnon</span> was<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>dedicated
to Aiken's benefactor Henry A. Murray, a Harvard psychologist. A few of
Aiken's many letters to Murray were published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Selected Letters of Conrad Aiken</span>
(1978). While in Boston in 1936, he met the artist Mary Augusta Hoover;
in her he fond the ideal partner for the third phase of his life. After
divorcing Clarissa, Aiken married Mary Hoover in Mexico. The trip, made
by train, became the basis of <span style="font-style: italic;">A Heart for the Gods of Mexico</span> (1939). Upon the outbreak of World War II, the couple moved from Rye to the United States. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Walk with me world, upon my right hand walk, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">speak to me Babel, that I may strive to assemble </font><br>
<font size="2">of all these syllables a single word </font><br>
<font size="2">before the purpose of speech is gone." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'This image or another', 1932) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1930 Aiken was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his collection<span style="font-style: italic;"> Selected Poems</span>. Most of Aiken's fiction was written between the 1920s and '30s, among others the novels<span style="font-style: italic;"> Blue Voyage </span>(1927), in which he used interior monologue, <span style="font-style: italic;">King Coffin</span> (1934), and the short story collections <span style="font-style: italic;">Bring! Bring!</span> (1925), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Among the Lost</span>
(1934), which contains the classic 'Silent Snow, Secret Snow,' a horror
story in which the sounds of the falling snow start to haunt a young
boy, and 'Mr. Arcularis,' recounting the dream voyage of an aesthete on
the operating table, just before his death. The story first appeared in
T.S. Eliot's <i>Criterion</i>. Later on Aiken adapted it into a play, published in 1957.</p>
<p>After staying two years in Rye, Aiken settled in 1947 in Brewster,
Massachusetts. He was a consultant in poetry at the Library of Congress
from 1950 to 1952. In 1953 he published <span style="font-style: italic;">Collected Poems</span>, which included the masterworks 'Preludes to Definition' and 'Morning Song of Senlin'. </p>
<p>From 1962 on Aiken wintered in a Savannah house adjacent to that of
his childhood. He died in Savannah on August 17, 1973. His tombstone
epitaph in the Bonaventure Cemetery reads: "Cosmos Mariner, Destination
Unknown." Posthumously published <span style="font-style: italic;">The Selected Letters of Conrad Aiken&nbsp; </span>(1978)
contains correspondence with such literary colleagues as Wallace
Stevens, Harriet Monroe, and Edmund Wilson. Besides the Pulitzer Prize,
Aiken's many honors and awards include National Book Award (1954),
Bollinger Prize in 1956, Gold Medal in Poetry from the American Academy
of Arts and Letters in 1958, and National Medal for Literature in 1969.
</p>
<p>Aiken was married three times. Two of his daughters from the first
marriage became writers: Jane Aiken Hodge (born in 1917), who started
to publish popular historical novels and works of romantic suspense
from the 1960s, and Joan Aiken. She was born in Sussex in 1924 and
educated at home before entering the school at the age of 12. A
prolific writer like her sister, Aiken produced more than 30 books for
adults and over 60 for children. Her first collection of short stories
for children, <i>All You've Ever Wanted,</i> appeared in 1953. Other works include <i>The Wolves of Willoughby Chase</i> (1962), <i>Black Hearts in Battersea</i> (1964), <i>The Silence of Herondale</i> (1964),<i> A Necklace of Raindrops</i> (1968), <i>Midnight is a Place</i> (1974), <i>The Shadow Guests</i> (1980), <i>The Cuckoo Tree</i> (1981), <i>The Way to Write for Children</i> (1982), <i>Mansfield Revisited</i> (1984), <i>Deception</i> (1987), <i>Blackground </i>(1989), <i>Jane Fairfax</i> (1990), <i>Morningquest</i> (1992), <i>Eliza's Daughter</i> (1994), <i>The Winter Sleepwalker</i> (1994), <i>Cold Shoulder Road </i>(1995); <i>The Cockatrice Boys</i> (1996), <i>The Jewel Seed</i> (1997). Joan Aiken's works combine elements from fairy tales, history, horror, supernatural, and adventure.</p>
