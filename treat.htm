<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> American writer, a three-time Edgar Allan
Poe Award Winner, frequently called the "father" of modern police
procedural novel. Treat himself did not accept the honour, although his
early novels paved way to the radio and television police series <i>Dragnet</i>,
      <a href="creasey.htm">John Creasey</a>'s Gideon stories, and Ed
McBain's 87th Precinct novels. <font size="2">(See also </font><a href="chimes.htm"><font size="2">Chester Himes</font></a><font size="2">
and his series of Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones.)</font> But
as a pioneer in mystery genre, Treat developed a narrative framework,
which differed from the traditional detective story, where the story
centers on a single person, like <a href="acdoyle.htm">Sherlock Holmes</a>
or <a href="simenon.htm">Inspector Maigret</a>. In Treat's novels
there is a group of police detectives with family problems. They have
conflicts inside departments, and work under-staffed too long hours.
The formula, which he started in the 1940s, have since been used
repeatedly in books, movies, and television series. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"... the jury trial is still the
best protection we have against injustice. It is one of the best
examples of democracy in action, representing the judgment of a cross
section of community, not a judge or police officer or government
official, but the people. Finally, it has become a marvelous
educational tool: every day across the country thousands of Americans
pass through our courtrooms as jurors, learning about their
Constitution and their Bill of Rights, and for a few hours or a few
days rising to a new level of responsibility."</b> (from <i>You're the
Jury </i>by Norbert Ehrenfreund and Lawrence Treat, 1992) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Lawrence Treat was born Lawrence Arthur Goldstone in New York.
After graduating from Darthmouth College in 1924, he entered Columbia
University, attaining a law degree in 1927. For some time, he worked as
a lawyer, but when his firm broke up in 1928, he moved to Paris, where
he began to write mystery stories. His earliest contributions to
mystery fiction were picture puzzles, some of which were collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bringing Sherlock Home</span> (1930). </p>
      <p>After returning in the United States, Treat devoted himself to
writing and produced 17 novels and over 300 short stories. He also
taught mystery writing. Treat's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Run Far, Run Fast</span> (1937), was
published under the name Goldstone. Under the pseudonym Lawrence Treat,
he launched in 1940 his first four-book series featuring the
criminologist Carl Wayward. In 1942, he met Rose Ehrenfreund, the
daughter of a Czech wigmaker. She became his wife of 55 years.
Rose was a registered nurse, who later embarked on an artistic career;
her friends included such names as as Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollack.
Before settling to Martha's Vineyard in the 1970s, they lived in a
wooded part of New York state. </p>
      <p>
In 1945, Treat became one of the founders of Mystery Writers of America
in New York City. He also served MWA's president and director. A
sought-after lecturer, he taught mystery writing at Columbia
University, New York University, Adelphi College, Ditmas High School in
Brooklyn and at public schools. Treat won twice the <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar
Allan Poe</a> Award, in 1965 for the short story 'H as in Homicide,'
which first appeared in <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazie</i>, and in
1978 for editing the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mystery
Writer's Handbook</span>. In 1981, Treat was a prize-winner at the
Crime Writers' International short story contest held in Stockholm,
Sweden. A special Edgar Allan Poe was awarded him in 1987 for his
television story on the Alfred Hitchcock program, 'Wake Me When I'm
Dead'. Treat died on January 7, 1998, in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. </p>
      <p>Treat's best-known characters include Commander Bill Decker,
Carl Wayard, a professor of psychology, and Mitch Taylor, a veteran
police officer, and his sidekick Jub Freeman, an easygoing forensic
expert, but who ambitiously declares: "I want to show those bastards
what the laboratory can do."<span style="font-style: italic;"> B as in
Banshee</span> (1940), <span style="font-style: italic;">D as in Dead</span>
(1941), and <span style="font-style: italic;">O as in Omen</span>
(1943) featured Carl Wayward, who is married during the course of the
series. Taylor's greed leads to his involvement in graft and he is
removed from NYPD in <span style="font-style: italic;">Big Shot</span>
(1951). Later Sue Grafton used Treat's title gimmick in her Alphabet
Mystery series. Freeman appeared alone in <span style="font-style: italic;">H as in Hunted</span> (1946) and Decker
was introduced in <span style="font-style: italic;">F as in Flight</span>
(1948). </p>
With <span style="font-style: italic;">V as in Victim</span> (1945),
Treat created the police procedural as we know it and established his
place in crime-fiction history. In the story Mitch Taylor, "a short,
chesty man with dark dry hair brushed back over his forehead", bemoans
the policeman's lot, tries to find ways to improve his chances of
promotion, and investigates a a murder and hit-and-run accident, along
with the coincidental connections between the two. Treat's innovation
did not lie in introducing the importance of scientific evidence within
the legal process, but in his characters &#8211; they were cops. Being a
police officer is a job for them, they have their own particular jargon
and slang, they tell cop tales, they share a professional bond, they do
not like paper work, and the police station is shabby. However, in
plotting Treat relied on the surprise ending of the traditional golden
age detective story.
      
      <p>To get the details right, Treat spent time with police
officers and at police stations. In&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">You're the Jury</span> (1992) Treat used
the expertise of Norbert Ehrenfreund, who had served as a judge for
seventeen years in the Superior Court of California &#8211; Treat was his
brother-in-law. The book was written for ages 13 and up. It looks at
justice in action through twelve actual trials from 1961 to 1991. The
clue of the book is that it gives the reader a chance to step into the
jury box. At the end of each chapter, the reader can check how the real
jury decided, and why. Often Treat rises moral questions. In one case,
'State v. Storm and McClure,' a father is charged with kidnapping his
twenty-four-year old daughter. He believes that the Church of the
Master, whose member she is, is an evil cult. </p>
      <p>For the young detectives Treat wrote such exercises in
observation, creativity and logic as <span style="font-style: italic;">Crime
And Puzzlement</span> (1881-82) and <span style="font-style: italic;">You're
the Detective!</span> (1983), in which the reader is asked to solve
mysteries using clues found in the brief story and accompanying
illustrations. "Remember, however, that detection is art and not
science, and being an art, there are not always precise answers." <font size="2">(from <i>Crime and Puzzlement 3</i>, 1988) </font></p>
      <p>Some of the stories were based on the knowledge of sailing. In
'Julius and the Jollyboat' Julius has bought a 12-foot sailing dinghy.
He takes a course in navigation, buys emergency equipment, and starts
confidently for his maiden voyage. The jollyboat tips over and the
question is: why? In the picture one can see Julius and a small boat
with a single sail, made for one-man operations. But there is no
centerboard &#8211; the boat has no stability. </p>
