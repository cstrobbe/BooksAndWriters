<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Hungarian novelist, essayist, and
dramatist, a major central European literary figure. Peter Nádas made
his international breakthrough with the monumental <i>Emlékiratok könyve</i> (1986, A Book of Memories), a psychological novel about remembering and forgetting 
in the tradition of Proust, Thomas Mann, and magic realism. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Experiences related to my past, but the
past is itself but a distant allusion to my insignificant desolation,
hovering as rootlessly as any lived moment in what I might call the
present: only memories of tastes and smells of a world to which I no
longer belong, one I might call my abandoned homeland, which I left to
no purpose because nothing bound me to the one I found myself in,
either; I was a stranger there, too, and not even Melchior, the only
human being I loved, could make me belong ..."</b></font><b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">A Book of Memories</font></i><font size="2">, tr. Ivan Sanders and Imre Goldstein) </font></blockquote>
<p>Péter Nádas was born in Budapest, the son of László Nádas, a
high-ranking party functionary, and Klára Tauber, a working-class
woman. During WW II, when Hungary was allied with Germany, they
supported the illegal Communist party, which gained control of the
government after the war. </p>
<p>Nádas's youth was shadowed by 
the loss of his parents: his mother died of cancer, and his father, a state prosecutor, committed suicide, 
soon after the Soviet troops to crushed the 1956 Hungarian uprising. 
Before the tanks entered Budapest, 
Nádas himself witnessed 
 in front of the Parliament building
the 
speech of Imre Nagy ("someone stepped forward, stumbled, his hat flew off... Laughter arose above the square..."),
 and was seized by "the sensation that everybody is with us, the whole world is with us," as 
he recalled. 

</p>
<p>In his early teens, Nádas began read voraciously, having a
particular fondness for Russian classics, Thomas Mann, Proust, Musil,
Molière, Shakespeare, the Bible. At the age of 16 his uncle, the
journalist Pál Aranyossi, gave him a camera. After dropping out of
school without finishing his chemistry studies, Nádas turned to
photojournalism. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he worked as an
editor, reader, and drama consultant. Following the Soviet-led invasion
of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Nádas quit his job as a journalist and
devoted himself to literature. "I resigned, walked out, and turned my
back on the system to save my soul," he later said in an interview. </p>
<p>In <i>A biblia</i> (1967), a novella, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Kulcskeres&#337; játék</span> (1969),
a collection of short stories, Nadás recalled his childhood
experiences. In the early 1980s Nádas moved with Magda Salamon from
Budapest and settled in Gombosszeg in south-western Hungary. Nádas and
Salamon, who had been living togerher since the 1960s, married in 1990.
With the trilogy <i>Takarítás</i> (1977, House Cleaning), <i>Találkozás</i> (1979, Encounter), and<i> Temetés </i>(1980,
Burial), Nádas established his fame in Hungary as one of the most
original playwrights of his generation. When he wanted to make a trip
abroad, to visit places important to Thomas Mann, the Hungarian secret
service tried to recruit him to inform on his acquaintances. "I didn&#8217;t
see the world until I was in my 30s because I wouldn&#8217;t accept the rules
of the regime for travel," he has said. "I would rather have isolation
than be told what I can do by the state." </p>
<p><i>Egy családregény vége</i> (The End of a Family Story), written
between 1969 and 1972, was published in 1977 after much hesitation by
the authorities. It depicts the eternal conflict of generations in
Stalinist Hungary, the era of Mátyás Rákosi, which led to the Hungarian
uprising. The events are seen from the point of view of a child, Péter
Simon, whose father, a state-security officer, becomes himself a victim
of the police state. Péter's illogical world, limited mostly to his
near circle, includes his grandfather, a Jew and a Holocaust survivor.
"Grandpa used to tell me lots of stories. But not fairy tales, real
stories," Péter recalls. In his monologue the grandfather reveals his
bizarre theory of the family history, and traces the genealogy back to
biblical times. Péter's father is treated as a traitor and the boy is
sent to a reform school. The ambivalent end of the book and the
narrator's world comes suddenly. </p>
<p>It took Nádas over ten years to finish <i>Emlékiratok könyve</i><i> </i>(A
Book of Memories), and several years to battle with censors before the
work was published in Hungary. During this period he wrote the novella <i>Szerelem</i>
(1979, Love), in which a man smokes a joint of marijuana with a woman
and examines, in excruciatingly minute detail, his actions and his
surroundings. He sees the outside world as an insane asylum. "The
biggest problem with "Love" is how dated the drug trip feels," wrote
Lisa Zeidner in <i>The New York Times</i> <font size="2">(</font><font size="2">December 17, 2000)</font>. <i>A Book of Memories</i> is made up of three first-person voices <font face="Symbol">-</font>
it is a confessional autobiography of a young Hungarian writer, working
on a historical novel about a German novelist named Thomas Thoenissen,
the memoir of a character of his own, a turn-of-the century aesthete,
and finally the voice of the protagonist's friend, who describes the
writer's last years. Combining an overall view of the decline of
Communist rule with introspective reflections on life, society, and
human nature, it documents changes in the mental history of Europe. <i></i>"Like
contemporary physics, fiction seems to work with ever more microscopic
units of observation; in the process, strange things happen. The
terrain of Eastern European experience depicted in "A Book of Memories"
might seem a gloomy and constricted place; yet it gains an amplitude
and an illumination from the painstaking attentiveness, the penetration
with which it is imagined and contemplated." <font size="2">(Eva Hoffman in <i>The New York Times</i>, July 27, 1997)</font> </p>
<p><i>A Lovely Tale of Photography</i> (1999) tells about a tormented photojournalist, who is confined to a 
sanatorium. The novella, which was nominated for the 2001 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, 
is composed of different short "scenes" and a flow of voices and monologues. "The sensation 
of thirst is more intense, more excruciating, and more maddening than any other bodily sensation, 
and for this reason it is no accident that in most languages it is synonymous with uncontrollable desire, 
and we often use it to form phrases such as thirst for revenge and bloodthirsty." 
<font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">A Lovely Tale of Photography</font></i><font size="2">)</font>. </p><p>
<i>Párhuzamos történetek </i>(2005, Parallel Stories), a trilogy on
which Nádas worked for 18 years, revolves around the histories of two
families, one Hungarian, one German. The novel was a bestseller but
received mixed reviews by critics, who were puzzled by its lack of
organizing perspective and chaotic structure. Abandoning causal
narrative and the&nbsp;assumption that the world has&nbsp;a symmetrical
structure, Nádas creates between his characters an irregular web of
acausal internal connections and analogies through such keywords as
murder, poverty, Jewishness, racism, masturbation, etc. "The question
is not what connects people who know each other, but rather, what is
the nature of the connections between those people who don't?" Nádas
has argued. Most of the tales take place in Budapest, where the center
is an apartment building designed in the early 20th century. </p>
<p><i>Fire and Knowledge: Fiction and Essays</i> (2007) included
Nádas's masteripiece 'The Lamb' (1966), about anti-Semitism, in which
the narrator and his friends bully a park caretaker named Reszo Róth.
"... if he hadn't been a Jew, and if our parents hadn't brought this up
so often as the ultimate argument against him, we might have discovered
at the bottom of our fear some attraction to him." In criticizing the
legacy of the Kádár regime and the rise of right-wing populism in
Hungary, Nádas has stated that "the first round of Hungary's attempt to
catch up with the modern states in Europe has failed." <font size="2">(<i>Die Zeit</i>, 15 April, 2010) </font>According to Nádas, the problem<b> </b>lays in the lack of a stabilising national bourgeoisie. </p>
<p>Nádas has received several literature prizes, including the Prize for Hungarian Art (1989), 
the Austrian State Prize for European Literature (1991) and the Vilenica International Prize for 
Literature (1998), the Franz Kafka literary prize (2003). In 2006 Nádas became a member of Akademie der Künste in Berlin and 
in 2007 he received the Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic. 
As a return to his early hobbies and profession, the author had in 1999 
a photographic exhibition in Budapest. </p>
