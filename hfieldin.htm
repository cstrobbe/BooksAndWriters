<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British writer, playwright and journalist,
founder of the English Realistic school in literature with Samuel Richardson.
Fielding's career as a dramatist has been shadowed by his fame as a novelist, who undertook the duty of writing comic 
epic poems in prose &#8211; Fielding once described himself as "great, tattered bard."</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When I'm not thanked at all, I'm thanked enough;</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">I've done my duty, and I've done no more." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Tom Thumb the Great</font></i><font size="2">, 1730) </font></blockquote>
<p>Henry Fielding was born at Sharpham Park, Somerset. He was by birth a gentleman, close allied to the aristocracy. 
His father was a nephew of the 3th Earl of Denbigha, and mother was from a prominent family of lawyers. Fielding 
grew up on his parents farm at East Stour, Dotset. His mother died when Fielding was eleven, and when 
his father remarried, Henry was sent to Eton College (1719-1724), where he learned to 
love ancient Greek and Roman literature. During this period he also befriended George, later Lord, Lyttelton, and 
William Pitt, later Lord Chatham. To Lyttelton, his old school friend, who helped him from the late 1740s, 
Fielding dedicated the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling</span> (1749). 
After Eton, he attempted to elope with his cousin 
Sarah Andrew. </p>
<p>Encouraged by his cousin, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Fielding began his literary career 
in London. In 1728 he wrote two plays, of which <span style="font-style: italic;">Love in Several Masques</span>, performed at Drury Lane, ran 
only four nights. 
In the same year he went to the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, enlarging his knowledge of classical 
literature. After returning to England, he devoted himself to writing for the stage. Under the 
pseudonym 'Sciblerus Secundus' he wrote comic-satirical burlesques, which made him the 
most successful playwrigh for several years in the British theatre. Fielding also became 
a manager of the Little Theatre in the Haymarket. In 1730 he had four plays produced, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">Tom Thumb</span>, 
which is his most famous and popular drama, particularly in its revised version, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Tragedy of Tragedies</span> (1731). According to a story, it made Swift laugh for the second time in 
his life. In 1736 Fielding took over the management of the New Theatre, writing for it among others the 
satirical comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquin</span>. For several years Fielding's life was happy and prosperous. </p>
<p>However, Fielding's sharp burlesques satirizing the government gained the attention of the prime 
minister Sir Robert Walpole and Fielding's activities in theater was ended by Theatrical Licensing Act - 
directed primarily at him. In search for an alternative career he became editor of the magazine <i>Champion</i>, 
an opposition journal. After studies of law Fielding was called in 1740 to the bar. Because of increasing illness &#8211; 
he suffered from gout and asthma &#8211; Fielding was eventually unable to continue as a Westminster justice. Physically 
Fielding was impressive, he was over six feet tall, with a "frame of a body large, and remarkably robust," as 
his first biographer, Arthur Murphy recorded. He was also known as a man with a great appetite for food, alcohol and 
tobacco; the joys of the rich diet he celebrated in the song 'The Roast Beef of Old England'.  </p>
<p>Between the years 1729 and 1737 Fielding wrote 25 plays but he acclaimed critical notice with his novels, 
<i>The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling</i>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews</span> (1742), a parody of Richardson's <i>Pamela</i> (1740). 

</p><p>Although Fielding said 
in <i>Tom Jones</i>,   "That monstrous animal, a husband 
and wife", he  married in 1734 Charlotte Cradock, who became his 
model for Sophia Western in <i>Tom Jones</i> and for the heroine of <span style="font-style: italic;">Amelia</span>, the author's last novel.  
It was written according to Fielding "to promote the cause of virtue and to expose some of the most 
glaring evils, as well public as private, which at present infect the country..." In the story an 
army officer is imprisoned. His virtuous wife resists all temptations and stays faithful to him. With 
Charlotte Fielding enjoyed ten years of happiness until her death in 1744, leaving him with a 
small son and daughter. Fielding had called her "one from whom 
I draw all the solid Comfort of my life." 

Fielding's improvidence led to 
long periods of considerable poverty, but he  did not drift into taking bribes.  At various periods of his life Fielding 
was greatly assisted by his 
friend R. Allen, the model for Allworthy in <i>Tom Jones</i>. His wife's fortune Fielding spent in living and 
hospitality. He had a small income from his share of his parents' farm and a tiny annuity from an uncle. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What is commonly called love, namely the desire of satisfying a 
voracious appetite with a certain quantity of delicate white human flesh."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Tom Jones</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1747 Fielding caused some scandal by marrying his wife's maid and friend Mary Daniel, who was 
six months pregnant at the time of the wedding  &#8211;  
Fiending was condemned by every snob in England. Actually she was about to bear his child, and Fielding 
wished to save her from disgrace. In the six years of their marriage, Mary bore him five children. </p>

<p>After Walpole had been replaced by another prime minister, Fielding 
came to the defense of the Establishment. As a reward for his governmental journalism he was made 
justice of the peace for the City of Westminster in 1748 and for the county of Middlesex in 1749. However, the 
position was unpaid, and thus not much admired. 
Together with his half brother Sir
John Fielding, assistant Saunders Welch, and clerk Joshua Brodgen, he established a new tradition of 
justice and suppression
of crime in London, organizing a detective force (with a salary), that later developed into Scotland Yard. Fielding's 
writings became more socially orientated &#8211; he opposed  among others public hangings. From the court 
in Bow Street he continued his struggle against corruption and and saw successfully implemented a 
plan for breaking up the criminal gangs who were then flourishing in London. 
One of his most controversial cases was the riot after which a sailor was executed. As a vehicle for  his 
ideas he used <i>The Covent-Garden Journal</i>. 
</p>
<p>When the author's health was failing and he was forced to use crutches,  he went with his wife, Margaret 
Collier,  
and one of his daughters to Portugal to recuperate in the milder air. His health badly damaged, 
Fielding died on October 8, 1754, in Lisbon. Fielding's 
travel book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon</span>, in which he recorded the unhappy journey, 
appeared posthumously in 1755. </p>
<p><i>The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling</i>, was enthusiastically revived by the general public, 
if not by Richardson, Dr. 
Johnson and other literary figures. Coleridge declared that the plot of <i>Tom Jones</i> was one 
of the three perfect plots in all literature, the others were Ben Jonson's <i>Alchemist</i> and 
Sophocles's <i>Oedipus Rex</i>. In its 'Preface' Fielding stated: "The excellence of the 
entertainment consists less in the subject than in the author's skill in well dressing it up... 
we shall represent human nature at first to keep appetite of our reader, in that more plain and simple 
manner in which it is found in the country, and shall hereafter hash and ragout it with all the high 
French and Italian seasoning of affectation and vice which courts and cities afford."  
Much of the action unfolds against the backdrop of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion. The introductory 
chapters that preface each of the novel's 18 books cultivate the reader in a way that was then 
unprecedented in English fiction.  The kindly, prosperous Mr Allworthy finds a baby boy on his 
bed. He adopts the  child, naming it Tom Jones. Allworthy suspects that Jenny Jones, a 
maid-servant to the wife of the schoolmaster Partridge, is the mother. Jenny leaves with 
Partridge the neighborhood. Allworthy's sister Bridget marries Captain Blifil, they have a 
son. Tom and the young and mean-spirited Blifil are raised together. Years later a rivalry 
over the attention of Sophia Western arises between them. Because of an affair with the 
gamekeeper's daughter Molly Seagrim, and because of Blifil's treachery, Tom is expelled 
from the house. He experiences adventures in the picaresque section of the novel, drifts 
into an affair with Lady Ballaston, nearly kills his opponent in a duel, and is imprisoned. 
Meanwhile Sophia flees to London to escape the marriage with Blifil. Jenny Jones turns up to 
reveal that Bridget is the mother of Tom, and Blifil's cruelties to Tom over the years are 
exposed &#8211; Blifil knew the truth of Tom's birth. Tom marries Sophia, who forgives him 
for his infidelities, and Tom becomes the heir of Allworthy. Ford Madox Ford's comment 
on the work was: "Obviously, marital bliss is possible to the wives of the worst 
of rakes and to the rakes themselves. But to convince us that that is the lot of one or 
other of his characters the writer must take much more trouble... and write much 
better."<font size="-1"> (from <i>The March of Literature</i>, 1938)</font> </p>
