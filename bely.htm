<p>Russian symbolist poet, memoirist, essayist and novelist, whose best-known work is <i>Peterburg</i>
(1916, Petersburg), a baroque evocation of pre-revolutionary capital of
Russia. Bely's masterpiece, with its playful use of language and
literary experiments, has often been compared to James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>.
The famous political thinker and essayist Isaiah Berlin has described
Bely as "a man of strange and unheard-of insights &#8211; magical and a holy
fool in the tradition of Russian Orthodoxy." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"For our own part, let us also say:
Apollon Apollonovich was not in the slightest agitated upon surveying
his completely green ears, enlarged to massive dimensions, against he
blood-red background of a burning Russia. Thus had he recently been
depicted: on the front page of a humorous little street journal, one of
those little Yid journals, the blood-red covers of which multiplied in
those days with shocking speed on the prospects that seethed with
humanity..."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Petersburg</font></i><font size="2">, trans. by </font><font size="2">David McDuff) </font></blockquote>

<p>Andrey Bely was born Boris Nikolayevich Bugaev in Moscow, the son of
a prominent professor of mathematics, N.V. Bugaev. Before becoming "a
writer by accident," he received a thoughtful education in the natural
sciences at the University of Moscow, where he studied from 1899 to
1906 science, philology and philosophy. Bely was also interested in
romantic music, religion, mysticism, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Kant
and Maeterlinck affected him also. With the publication of his first
prose work, he took the pen name Andrey Bely ("Andrew White"), partly
because colors had for him a special significance and parly to avoid
embarrassing his father, who was the dean of the faculty of science at
Moscow. A positivist, he supported strongly the doctrine that all true
knowledge was scientific. Bely's conflict with his father provided him
a recurring theme in his works &#8211; in <i>Petersburg</i> a son plans to assassinate his father, a reactionary senator. </p>
<p> Bely was the most talented novelist of the "second-generation" of
writers, who emerged from the Symbolist movement at the turn of the
century. The period is commonly called the "Silver Age". Symbolists
emphasized spiritual and mystical elements in art. Bely believed that
it is possible to acquire knowledge of the "world beyond" through the
contemplation of artistic "symbols." In his youth he had frequented the
salon of M.S. Solovyov, and was introduced in the apocalyptic
philosophy of Vladimir Solovyov (1853-1900), who regarded poetic
symbols as "windows on eternity". In the essay 'The Magic of Words'
(1909) Bely stated that the word is a magical, world-creating force:
"When I say 'I', I create a sound symbol. I assert this symbol as
something existing. And only at that moment do I create myself," Bely
wrote. The image symbol is connected with metaphor: "The word begot
myth; myth begot religion; religion begot philosophy; and philosophy
begot the term." </p>

<p>  In his four <i>Symphonies </i>(1902-1908) Bely attempted to create
a new literary form, which combined prose, poetry, music, and even, in
part, painting. Anticipating structuralist-semiotic theories, he argued
that a word has a logical meaning, and a certain phonetic sound has an
emotional meaning. </p>
<p>Bely's first collection of verse, <i>Zoloto v lazuri </i>(1904),
appeared when he was 24. Its optimistic in tone changed after the
failure of the 1905 revolution into disillusionment in <i>Pepel</i> (1909). <i>Urna</i> (1909) was a collection of love lyrics. The three collections were typographically innovative and used daring metaphors. <i>Urna </i>was inspired by Bely's affair with  <a href="blok.htm">Aleksandr Blok</a>'s wife Liubov Mendeleev &#8211; he later depicted his fellow poet  in <i>Vospominaniya o Bloke</i>
(1923). Bitterness between Blok and Bely led them to challenge each
other to duels. However, some kind of truce was achieved when Bely fell
in love with another woman. In 1909 he met the eighteen-year-old Asia
Turgenieva, the grand niece of Ivan Turgenev. They married in 1912, but
the date of their marriage, usually given as 1914, in Bern,
Switzerland, is according to some sources perhaps a civil marriage
required by Swiss law. They separated in 1921. </p>
<p>From 1903 to 1909 Bely contributed actively to the journal <i>Vesy</i>. He then worked for the publishing house Musagetes 1909-10. Bely's first novel,  <i>Serebryany golub</i>
(1909, Silver Dove), was structurally based on oppositions &#8211; the
division between intelligentsia an the folk, spiritualism and
eroticism, rationality and instincts. The protagonist, Petr
Dar'ial'skii, is a young philosopher and poet. He searches spiritual
revival, spends time among simple rural people, and is involved with an
eschatological religious sect, the Doves. It is headed by an impotent
carpenter, Kudearov, who has selected Dar'ial'skii as the surrogate
father for a Dove-child. Later Bely claimed that he had foreseen in
this novel the rise of Rasputin and Rasputinism. </p>
<p><i>Petersburg</i> was a story of conspiracy and betrayal set in the
days of the 1905 Revolution. In writing the novel, Bely especially
studied the language of Pushkin and Gogol, becoming one of the masters
of the word in modern Russian fiction. Yevgeny Zamyatin said that
Bely's <i>Petersburg </i>has the same complicated relation to the Russian language that <i>Ulysses </i>has to English. </p>
<p>After P.B. Struve refused to publish the early version  of the novel in the journal <i>Russian Thought</i>, Bely continued his work, and in 1913-14 it appeared in the almanac <i>Sirin</i>,
and later in book form. Still dissatisfied with the text, Bely started
a series of revisions, and this version was printed in Berlin in 1922.
In the Soviet Union <i>Petersburg</i> was published in 1928. Originally it was conceived as the second part of Bely's East and West trilogy, the first part was <i>The Silver Dove</i>.
The third part was never written. The novel remained unknown to
English-speaking readers until John Cournos's translation of 1959.
Later Robert Maguire and John Malmstad produced the definitive English
version of the 1922 ("Berlin") text. <br>
 </p>
<p>The Russian Estonian semiotician <a href="lotman.htm">Yuri Lotman</a>
has said that St. Petersburg is inseparable from its mythology. The
city contains two achetypes: "the 'eternal Rome' and the 'non-eternal,
doomed, Rome' (Constantinople)" <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Universe of the Mind</font></i><font size="2">, 1990)</font>.
Bely was a Muscovite and his attitude toward the imperial, "illegal",
Germanic capital was deeply negative. Like Gogol and Dostoevsky before
him, Bely portrayed the city in dramatic, mythical light, and mixed
hallucination with reality. At the same time the work was the
culmination of the Petersburg theme in literature and a total
annihilation of the image of the Russian capital city. </p>
<p>In the story a group of radicals plan the assassination of Senator
Apollon Apollonovich Ableukhov, but their act of revolution turns into
a farce and a patricide, which eventually fails. The bomb is
camouflaged as a can of sardines, Nikolai Apollonovich Ableukhov
manages to lose it, and blows up his father's study. Bely's text is
full of hallucinatory images &#8211; the Bronze Horseman visits Apollon
Apollonovich, and the section mark become the thirteenth sign of the
zodiac. "What a vile idea the book has," said Ivan Bunin, who himself
wrote of the decay of the Russian nobility. </p>
<p>During the writing of  <i>Petersburg </i>Bely became interested in anthroposophy. He read also Helene Blavatsky's <i>Secret Doctrine</i>.
The years 1910-16 Bely spent abroad and living several years in
Dornach, Switzerland, as Rudolf Steiner's (1861-1925) discipline. At
that time the Goetheanum, an anthroposophical temple and centre, was
under construction, and Belyi worked at the site. "In 1912-13," Asia
Turgeneva later recalled, "our entire life was under the sign of
Rudolf's Steiner's lectures." Bely returned to Russia in 1916 but Asia
remained in Dornach for the rest of her life. </p>
<p>"He had, as it were, a therapeutic smile," Bely wrote later of
Steiner, "the countenance blossomed in the abundance of perfect love
into a barely discernible rose-exuding fragrance. He only 'bestowed' a
smile, but one felt that one had nothing <i>of the kind</i> to give in
return." Steiner believed that through training individuals could
retrieve their innate capacity to perceive a spiritual realm, a
subconscious cosmic memory. One exercise involved the concentrated
recollection of life before one was born. The influence of his thoughts
marked <i>Kotik Letayev </i>(1917-18), an autobiographical work on his childhood which he started to write in Switzerland, <i>Zapiski chudaka </i>(1922), and <i>Glossolalia </i>(1922). Bely's narrative poem 'Pervoe svidanye' is considered his greatest lyrical achievement. Among his later works is <i>Kreshchony kitayets</i> (1927), drawn from the sounds of Schumann's Kreisleriana, and<i> Maski</i> (1933), his last novel which Bely called a "lyrical epic poem." </p>
<p>During the revolution and civil war Bely lived in poverty, but he
welcomed the fall of the tsarist regime with the poem 'Khristos
voskrese' (1918), in which he praised new future with Messianic tones.
Between the years 1917 and 1921 he worked as a lecturer in Moscow and
Petrograd. In 1921, after Blok's death, Bely left for Berlin, where he
spent a few years. <br>
</p>
      <p>The Café Landgraf in the large Russian quarter became a
favorite meeting place; it was called the House of Arts. Such writers
as Bely, Sergei Esenin, Boria Pasternak, Aleksei Tolstoy, andd Marina
Tsvetaeva recited there their prose or poetry. Bely and others founded
a local branch of Petrograd's Free Philosophical Association. Finding
exile untolerable, Bely returned to the Soviet Union in 1923, but the
home-coming turned sour, when Leon Trotskii denounced him in his
Marxist literary study <i>Literature and Revolution</i>. "I returned to my grave," Bely concluded and appealed to Stalin. </p>

      <p>Bely was known for his suddenly changing intellectual and
political stands, and now he expressed his belief in Marxism, although
he did not abandon his anthroposophical ideas and friends. In 1931 Bely
married Klavdiia Nikolaevna Vasil'eva. Bely's trilogy of memoirs, which
appeared in the early 1930s, depicted Russian social and cultural life
before, during and after the revolution. Bely also revised much of the
poetry he had written earlier during his career. His last book was <i>Masterstvo Gogolya </i>(1934), a detailed study of Gogol's language and style. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bely died on January 8, 1934. A year later the Russian
linguist and literary theorist Roman Jacobson indicated that the prose
of Belyi, Maiakovskii, Pasternak and others was already opening up
"hidden paths to a revival of&nbsp; Russian&nbsp; prose." However,
following the enforcement of Socialist Realism as the dominant
aesthetic dogma, a large quantity of Bely's writings remained
unpublished. After 1940 his works were banned, but the ban was partly
lifted in 1965. Bely's writing influenced among others <a href="olesha.htm">Yury Olesha</a>
(1899-1960), Boris Pilnyak (1984-1941), and the early works of the
Nobel writer Boris Pasternak. "... of course Andrey Bely was a genius &#8211;
<i>Petersburg</i>, <i>Kotik Letaev</i> are full of wonderful things &#8211; I
know that, you need not tell me &#8211; but his influence was fatal,"
Pasternak once confessed Isaiah Berlin. In the 1960sPasternak supported financially Bely's widow and others in need.  <br>
