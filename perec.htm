<p>French novelist, poet, essayist, dramatist, and literary innovator,
who gained fame with his formally complex and puzzling works after the<i> nouveau roman</i> had lost its experimentalist freshness. Perec's most famous books include <i>La Disparation </i>(1969, A Void), written without the letter <i>e</i>, and <i>La Vie mode d'emploi</i> (1978, Life: A User's Manual), about the residents of an apartment building. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was in the final months of his life
that the artist Serge Valene conceived the idea of a painting that
would reassemble his entire existence: everything his memory had
recorded, all the sensations that had swept over him, all his
fantasies, his passions, his hates would be recorded on canvas, a
compendium of minute parts of which the sum&nbsp; would be his life."</b> (in </font><font size="2"><em>Life: A User's Manual</em>, 1978</font><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>

<p>Georges Perec was born in Paris into a family of Polish Jews. He was
the only son of Icek Judko and Cyrla (Schulewicz) Peretz, who had
emigrated to France in the 1920 and settled in Belleville, a working
class area in Paris.&nbsp;The surname was originally a Hebrew
word,&nbsp;but as the family scattered around the world, it
had&nbsp;mutated into "Perez," "Peres," "Perutz," "Peiresc," and in
France "Perec". </p><p>When the war broke out, Perec's father enlisted
in the French army and died in a field hospital in 1940 of untended
wounds, &nbsp;the very last day of fighting, "after being wounded in
the abdomen by machine-gun fire or a shell splinter.'' Other members of
family, including Perec's mother, were killed in the Nazi concentration
camps. Cyrla Peretz was first taken to a camp in Drancy and from there
she was probably sent to Auschwitz. </p>
<p>From 1942 Perec was brought up by his paternal aunt Esther and her
husband David Bienenfeld, who was a successful pearl trader. In 1945
they formally adopted their nine-year-old foster child. After
graduating from a Catholic boarding school, Perec studied history and
sociology at the Sorbonne and started to write reviews and essays for
the <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i> and<i> Les Lettres Nouvelles</i>.
At the Étampes Lycée he enrolled in Jean Duvignaud's philosophy class.
Duvignaud encouraged Perec to write and became his mentor in the
Parisian literary scene. </p><p>In 1958-59 Perec served in the army.
After discharge, he married Paulette Petras and lived for a few years
in Tunis, where his wife worked as a teacher. From 1962 to 1979 Perec
was employed as a poorly paid archivist at the Neuropsysiological
Research Laboratory attached to the Hôpital Saint-Antoine. A nearly
suicidal love affair with a wealthy older woman, Suzanne Lipinska,
prompted him to take up analysis with Jean-Bernard Pontalis from May
1971. His dreams he collected in <em>La Boutique obscure: 124 rêves</em> (1973).
</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, Perec started to write in collaboration with his
translator Eugen Helmle and the musician Philippe Drogoz a series of
radio plays. <span style="font-style: italic;">Die Maschine</span> (1972) analyzed a poem by Goethe from a pseudo-scientific point of view, utilizing an arithmetical substitution game. In the 1970s he became interested in cinema. Perec's first film, co-directed by Bernard Queysanne, was based on his novel <i>Un Homme qui dort</i>. It won the Prix Jean Vigo in 1974. From 1976 Perec made crossword-puzzles for the magazine <i>Le Point</i>. The success of <i>La Vie mode d'emploi </i>enabled
Perec to devote himself entirely to writing. In 1981 he was a
writer-in-residence at the University of&nbsp; Queensland, Australia.
During this period he worked with the unfinished detective novel <i>Cinquante-Trois Jours</i>, but ill healt forced him to return to France. <br>
</p>
      <p>Perec died of cancer at the age of forty-six on March 3, 1982. His final novel <span style="font-style: italic;">53 Days</span>, a homage to the low-brow detective stories, contained references to an unfinished manuscript, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Crypt</span>.
Perec only completed the first eleven chapters, but left notes how the
riddle would be solved &#8211; at the end there is a writer called GP who has
accepted a challenge to create this book. The title of the novel refers
to the time it took Stendhal to write <span style="font-style: italic;">Charterhouse of Parma</span>. The last six years of his life, Perec lived with the director Catherine Binet,&nbsp;whose film&nbsp; <em>Les jeux de la Comtesse Dolingen de Gratz</em> (1981) he produced. <span></span></p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Before, there was nothingm or almost
nothing; afterwards, there isn't much, a few signs, but which are
enough for there to be a top and a bottom, a beginning and an end,
right and a left, a recti and a verso."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Species of Spaces and Other Pieces</font></i><font size="2">, 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p>Perec made his debut as a novelist with <i>Les Choses </i>(1965,
Things), which won the Prix Renaudot. In 1967 Perec joined the Ouvroir
de Littérature Potentielle (OuLiPo), a group of writers and
mathematicians founded by <a href="quene.htm">Raymond Queneau</a> and
François Le Lionnais. OuLiPo became Perec's intellectual home. The
group devoted to exploring the creative potentials of formal rules, and
specialized in anagrams, palindromes, mathematical word games, and
other puzzles. Perec's longest palindrome <font face="Symbol">-</font> a sentence or a word which reads the same both ways <font face="Symbol">- </font>consisted of more than 5,000 words. </p>
<p>Experimenting with the lipogram <font face="Symbol">-</font> a text which one or more letters of the alphabet may not appear <font face="Symbol">-</font> Perec produced<i> La Disparition</i>
(1969, A Void, translated by Gilbert Adair), a 200-page detective novel
(in some sources 311-page novel), in which the central puzzle deals
with the disappearance of the <i>e</i><i> </i>from the alphabet. (But
the letter appears outside the main text.) Perec's translator, Gilbert
Adair, managed to replicate the feat in English, although the
pioneering work is Ernest Vincent Wright <i>Gads</i>, a novel with over 50000 words, <i></i>written
in English without the letter E. "But the paradox of liberating fetters
is not one that will puzzle us, not when we think of the way we all
narrow our options in order to expand our horizons in everyday life.
Think of the new possibilities you have found in denying yourself, no
matter what, the use of the far right lane; in never humming a tune
whose lyrics employ "baby" or "girl" or "doncha know"; in going one day
at a time without using the P-word (pr*bl*m*t*c)." <font size="2">(</font><font size="2">James R. Kincaid in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">March 12, 1995) </font></p>
<p>Later Perec used all the saved <i>e</i>'s from<i> La Disparition</i> in <i>Les Revenentes</i> (1972), which was written without the vowels <i>a</i>,<i> i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, but contained <i>e</i>. <i>Espèces d'espaces</i>
(1974) examined spaces around and outside us, from one's bed to the
universum. Perec's starting point was how letters, words, and lines
fill a blank sheet of paper, forming a kind of space: "before, there
was nothing, or almost nothing; afterwards, there isn't much, a few
signs, but which are enough for there to be a top and a bottom, a
beginning and an end, a right and a left, a recto and a verso." </p>
<p><i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance </i>(1975, W or the Memory of
Childhood) is an exceptional Holocaus narrative, in which chapters of
childhood memories alternate with chapters of a fictional story. "I
have no memories of childhood," Perec confessed<font size="2">. </font>He
compares his isolated memories with photograps, and imagines comforting
scenes from his unfulfilled childhood: "As for me, I would have liked
to help mother clear the dinner from kitchen table. There would have
been a blue, small-checkered oilcloth on the table, and above it, a
counterpoise lamp with a shade shaped almost like a plate, made of
white porcelain or enamelled tin, and a pulley system with pear-shaped
weights. Then I'd have fetched my satchel, got out my books and my
writing pad and my wooden pencil-box. I'd have put them on the table
and done my homework. That's what happened in the books I read at
school."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font>The
fictional material consists of a story of a false identity and a
dystopia set on an island called W, somewhere off Tierra del Fuego.
Aryans have created on the island a totalitarian society. It based on a
bizarre conception of sports, in which men are separated from women,
children from their mothers, and losers receive grisly punishments. In
the end the two complementary narratives unite when Perec refers to a
book, which describes how sporting competition was developed in
concentration camps into a vehicle of destruction. </p>

<p><i>Life: a user's manual</i> was awarded the prestigious Prix
Médicis. It has over 100 interwoven stories which concern the
inhabitants of a large Parisian apartment building situated at 11 rue
Simon-Crubellier. The structure of the novel is governed by chessboard
of ten squares by ten, knight's moves, algorithms, and principles which
the author only knows. The building was inspired by a Saul Steinberg
drawing of a New York apartment house with its façade removed. One of
the characters is Percival Bartlebooth, an English millionaire, who
decides to bring artistic and formal control of his life to its
outermost limits: he would study watercolor painting with Serge Valene
for ten years, then he would travel the world for 20 years and paint
pictures of different ports. The watercolors are cut into jigsaw
puzzles in Paris. The rest of his life-plan, 20 years, Bartlebooth
reassembles the jigsaws, which finally are dipped into a detergent
solution until nothing else is left but a blank paper. However,
Bartlebooth dies before he has finished all 500 of his jigsaw puzzles.
Perec reveals nothing of Bartlebooth's childhood; the final pieces are
not put together. </p>
