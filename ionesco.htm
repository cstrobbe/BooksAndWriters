      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Romanian-born French dramatist,
whose
one-act
antiplay, <span style="font-style: italic;">La Cantatrice chauve</span>
(1950; <i>The Bald Soprano</i>), inspired the Theater
of the Absurd (see also <a href="beckett.htm">Samuel Beckett</a>, <a href="ajarry.htm">Alfred
Jarry</a>). Ionesco's later, full-length plays centre around a
constant, semiautobiographical figure, Bérenger. Since the 1970s, his
writing were mainly non-theatrical. Ionesco's earlier works were
characterized by the logic of nightmare, but later he began to employ a
more straightforward plot line. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"All my plays have their origin in
two fundamental states of consciousness: now the one, now the other is
predominant, and sometimes they are combined. These basic states of
consciousness are an awareness of evanescence and of solidity, of
emptiness and too much presence, of the unreal transparency of the
world and its opacy, of light and of thick darkness."</b> (foreword in </font><i><font size="2">Plays I</font></i><font size="2">, 1958) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Eugène Ionesco was born in Slatina, Romania, of a French
mother and Romanian father. Shortly after his birth, his mother,
Thérèse Icard, brought him to Paris, where he spent the years 1914-25.
The marriage was not a happy one, and Ionesco's father, , a lawyer,
moved back to his home country on the outbreak of World War I. At the
age of nine, Ionesco spent with his younger sister some time in the
village of La Chapelle-Anthenaise in Mayenne, which later became an
archetypal image of Eden in his plays. Thérèse returned to Romania with
her children in 1925. There she found out that her husband had managed
to divorce her and retain custody of the children. </p>
      <p>Ionesco hated Bucharest and its mores, its anti-Semitism, but
perfected his knowledge of his father's language and began to write
essays and poems. He pronounced his <i>r</i>'s as the French do and
was often taken as a Jew. Ionesco's father remarried and his new wife's
family was very right-wing. </p>
      <p>Ionesco studied literature in Paris and in Romania and
eventually took a degree in French at the University of Bucharest.
After his graduated, he lived in Bucharest teaching French and writing
poetry and literary criticism. His book of criticism, <span style="font-style: italic;">Non</span>, appeared in
1934. In 1936 he married Rodica Burileano, a student of law and
philosophy. Two years later he received a scholarship that enabled him
to return to France, where he planned to write a thesis on 'The Themes
of Death and Sin in French Poetry.' Ionesco did research at the
National Library but came to the conclusion that the French &#8211; Pascal,
Péguy, and others &#8211; had no feeling for death and never felt guilty.
"The basic problem is that if God exists, what is the point of
literature?" Ionesco once said. "And if He <i>doesn't </i>exist, what
is the point of literature? Either way, my writing, the only thing I
have ever succeeded in doing, is invalidated."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(Ionesco in 1984, from </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights
at Work</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by George Plimpton, 2000) </font></p>
      <p>Ionesco got involved with the Collège de 'Pataphysique' and
became friends with <a href="quene.htm">Raymond Queneau</a> and Boria
Vian, who were its most active members. The Collège was dedicated to
nihilist irony, practical jokes, and the demolition of culture. It had
a commission which was preparing a thesis on the history of latrines.
Ionesco's physical appearance gave the impression of a sad clown &#8211; he
had protuberant eyes, overgrown ears, potato like nose, and stomach
hanging over the belt. Life is a farce, he used to said. During World
War II Ionesco lived with his wife in Marseilles. Their daughter,
Marie-France, was born in 1944. They returned to Paris after its
liberation from the Germans. Ionesco worked as a proofreader and in
1945 he was awarded a doctorate. </p>
      <p>While learning English in 1948, Ionesco conceived the idea for
his first play, <i>La Cantatrice chauve</i> (The Bald Soprano),
produced in 1950. At the premiere, twenty to thirty members of Collège
turned up wearing their gidouilles on their lapels. <i>The Bald
Soprano </i> was inspired by the repetitive and nonsensical phrases of
his Lingaphone record. It consists mainly of clichés of a
foreign-language phrase book, and a series of meaningless conversations
between two couples that eventually deteriorate into babbling. This the
play went first unnoticed but arose attention when such writers as Jean
Anouilh and <a href="quene.htm">Raymond Queneau</a> started to
campaign for it. </p>
      <p>In rapid succession Ionesco wrote a number of dramas,
including <span style="font-style: italic;">La Leçon</span> (1951), a
picture of the erotic thrust of tyrannical power,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Les Chaises</span> (1952), in which the
real and the world of make-believe collide on a stage filled with
dozens chairs with invisible guests, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Victimes du devoir</span> (1954), a
detective-story parody, in which his characters search for "Mallot with
a <i>t</i>."<span style="font-style: italic;"> Amédée ou Comment s'en
débarrasser</span> (1954) portrayed a couple, Amédée and his wife
Madeleine, who share their apartment with a slowly growing corpse,
possibly killed by them years ago. Bérenger, a little Everyman, was
featured first in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tueur sans gages</span>
(1958). Intriguingly, they were labelled as "anti-plays", "comic
dramas", "pseudo-dramas", "naturalistic comedies", and "tragic farces"
which only added to their success. By 1955 Ionesco's reputation was
established in France. Gradually he was acclaimed as one of the leading
exponents of the theatre of absurd. </p>
      <p>Among Ionesco's other well-known plays are <span style="font-style: italic;">Le roi se meurt</span> (1963) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Rhinocéros</span> (1959).<font size="2">
      </font>"When <i>Rhinoceros</i> was produced in Germany, it had
fifty curtain calls. The next day the papers wrote, "Ionesco shows us
how we became Nazis." But in Moscow, they wanted me to rewrite it and
make sure that it dealt with Nazism and not with their kind of
totalitarianism. In Buenos Aires, the military government thought it
was an attack on Peronism. And in England they accused me of being a
petit bourgeois."<font size="2"><b> </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights
at Work</font></i><font size="2">) </font>&#8211; <i>Rhinocero</i>s, set in
a small provincial town, was described by Ionesco as "an anti-Nazi
play". In the background of the story was Ionesco's disgust when he saw
how his friend slowly accepted Nazism. Bérenger, an average
middle-class citizen, shows little interest in the fact that a
rhinoceros has appeared in the town, he is bored, but other people are
willingly transform themselves into rhinoceroses. He quarrels with his
friend Jean and Daisy, his pretty secretary. In the office Bérenger
witnesses that also the staff is gradually joining the rhinoceroses.
Finally Daisy and he are the only human beings, and when Daisy too
turns into rhinoceros, Bérenger decides to defend himself with a gun.
He is not going to capitulate. <i>Rhinocero</i>s was received with
enthusiasm. In London it was produced at the Royal Court Thearte. The
director was Orson Welles. </p>
      <p>Most of Ionesco's dramas are long one-act-pieces, or
untraditional three-act plays. He has also written essays, published in
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes et contre-notes</span>
(1962), textbooks for children, and a novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Solitaire</span> (1973). Its anonymous
narrator is a clerk. He has lived for twenty years in a dingy hotel and
worked in a small-time business. After inheriting a small fortune he
can start a new life. "Now I was able to stroll at will along the main
thoroughfares, the broad avenues of the big jail. It was a world
comparable to a zoo in which the animals enjoyed a kind of
semi-freedom, with man made mountains, artificial woods, and imitation
lakes, but at the far reaches there were still the same old fences."
The protagonist wants to see "what is behind the walls" but in his
boredom he falls into the abyss of his own mind. </p>
      <p>Ionesco's characters seem like robots, often enslaved by the
dictatorial will of an unseen manipulator. From the beginning
Surrealism and Dadaism influenced his work, especially Antonin Artaud's
Theater of Cruelty concept and the black humor of André Breton, Robert
Desnos, and Tristan Tzara. Also Kafka, Dostoyevsky, and Beckett were
important writers for him. His dramas deal with suffering, fear, and
destruction, the emptiness of polite conversation. "There are no
alternatives; if man is not tragic, he is ridiculous and painful,
"comic" in fact, and by revealing his absurdity one can achieve a sort
of tragedy," Ionesco once said. "In fact I think that man must either
be unhappy (metaphysically unhappy) or stupid." <font size="2">(Ionesco
in the New York </font><i><font size="2">Times</font></i><font size="2">,
June 1, 1958) </font></p>
      <p>In <i>The Killer </i>(1960), which has been compared with
Kafka's <i>The Trial</i>, Bérenger tracks down an elusive murderer who
destroys for the sake of destroying in a perfect neighborhood. At the
end, Bérenger is unable to escape the menace that has taken over the
town. Ionesco has admitted that often got ideas from dreams. Language,
with its clichés, is inadequate medium when portraying reality and many
things in his plays are left unexplained. His pessimism about the work
of writers he expressed in 1970: "But for some time now, science and
the psychology of the subconscious have been making enormous progress,
whereas the empirical revelations of writers have been making very
little. In these conditions, can literature still be considered as a
means to knowledge?" Ionesco was elected in 1970 to the Académie
Française. His seventieth birthday was celebrated in 1982 worldwide.
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Hugoliades</span>, his satirical portrait of Victor Hugo, which he wrote at
the age of twenty, was published decades later by Gallimard. In his last years
Ionesco abandoned writing and devoted himself to painting and
exhibiting his works. He died in Paris on March 28, 1994. </p>
