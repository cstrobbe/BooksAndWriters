<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>


<p>Scottish novelist, educator, and scholar, who became better known as
mystery writer Michael Innes. Stewart's
witty, playful mystery stories, written in a highly literate prose, are
classics of the genre. His hero was Inspector Appleby, who later
becomes Sir John, retired Scotland Yard Commissioner. In 1987 the
critic H.R.F. Keating included <i>Appleby's End  </i>(1945) among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. <!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Stewart also produced academic monographs, including the final volume of the <i>Oxford History of English Literature</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"To Appleby one could well apply the words which Michael Innes, writing under his own name in the novella <i>The Man Who Wrote Detective Stories</i>,
employs to describe that hero: 'He loved tumbling out scraps of poetry
from a ragbag collection in his mind &#8211; and particularly in absurd and
extravagant contexts.' In <i>Appleby's End</i> our sleuth is whirled
up and down, round and round, in as fantastical a situation as anyone
could wish - all all the while out tumble the scraps of poetry."</b> (from <i>Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</i> by H.R.F. Keating, 1987) </font></blockquote>


<p>John Innes Mackintosh Stewart was born near Edinburgh, the son of
John Stewart and Elizabet Jane (née Clark) of Nairn. His father was a
lawyer and director
of Education in the city of Edinburg. Stewart attended Edinburgh
Academy, where Robert Louis Stevenson had been
a pupil for a short time. At Oriel College, Oxford, Stewart studied
English. Among his undergraduate contemporaries were Christopher
Isherwood and W.H. Auden, who had determined to become a great poet.
Stewart sat opposite him during final examinations. Auden got only a
third-class degree, and Stewart witnessed how the "tears were coursing
down his pale and ample cheeks." Stewart won the Matthew Arnold
Memorial Prize and was named a Bishop
Frazer's scholar. <br>
</p>
      <p>After graduation in 1929 Stewart went to Vienna where he studied Freudian psychoanalysis
for a year. Stewart's first book, an edition of Florio's translation of <i>Montaigne</i>,
got him a lectureship at the University of Leeds (1930-1935). Stewart
married in 1932 Margaret Harwick, who created a career as a doctor.
They had five children, one of them the novelist Angus Stewart, author
of <i>Sandel </i>(1968). </p>

<p>From 1936 Stewart was Jury Professor of English 
Literature at the University of Adelaide, 
in South Australia. He held the chair that had been long 
occupied by Sir Archibald Strong.  Stewart found the Australian accent "ugly", and 
suspected that because of his Oxford English accent, he was very seldom asked to do 
any broadcasting in Adelaide. </p>


<p></p>
While travelling from Liverpool to Adelaide, Stewart wrote his first mystery story,
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Death at the President's Lodging </span>(1936), which introduced C.I.D. Inspector John Appleby. His second, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hamlet, Revenge!
      </span>(1937), confirmed his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated
writer. In the story a murder occurs in the context of a theatrical performance of 
Hamlet. The key document in the case is Shakespeare's play itself.  One 
of the characters, called Gervase Crispin,  gave the mystery writer and 
composer <a href="crispin.htm">Robert Bruce Montgomery</a> (alias "&#8220;Edmund Crispin") 
the surname of his pseudonym and his detective's ("Gervase Fen") first name. Montgomery's 
style in his first novels was so similar to Innes's, that his editor at Faber believed him to
be actually J.I.M. Stewart.  <font size="2"> 
(In <i>Bruce Montgomery/Edmund Crispin: A Life in Music and Books</i>  
by David Whittle, 2007.)</font> Both authors also gave their characters 
more or less ridiculous names. <p></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Lament for a Maker</span> (1938) had a 
lenghty description of bush near the Great 
Australian Blight. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Daffodil Affair </span>(1942) Appleby poses as an Australian rancher; 
the mysterious 
place called Cobdogla, which Stewart mentions in the story, is a small 
irrigation 
settlement about five kilometres west of Barmera  Stewart's most developed 
Autralian 
character was Martin Fish, whom the narrator, Duncan Pattullo, meets in the 
first 
volume of the Oxford quintet novels, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Straircase in Surrey </span>(1974). Other parts 
include <span style="font-style: italic;">Young Pattullo </span>(1975), <span style="font-style: italic;">Medmorial Service&nbsp;</span> (1976), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Full Term</span> (1978).  


</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Appleby remembered his uncle George, who
used to recite at parties a poem beginning 'A chieftain to the
Highlands bound' &#8211; and at 'bound' </b></font><b><i><font size="2">bound</font></i><font size="2">
into the middle of the room... Fate did not come like that. On the
great stage the common traffic of life was proceeding with an even,
untroubled rhythm &#8211; and then Fate was </font><i><font size="2">there</font></i><font size="2">, his entrance unnoticed, his menace waiting to strike home." </font></b><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Hamlet, Revenge!</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>After World War II Stewart returned to England. He spent two years at
Queen's University in Belfast. There he wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The Journeying Boy</span>
(1949), notable for the richly comedic use of Irish setting. In 1949 he
was appointed as Student of Christ Church, Oxford, and from 1969 to
1973 Stewart also held the position of Reader in English Literature of
Oxford University. Upon retirement, he became professor emeritus.
Stewart died on November 12, 1994, at the age of eighty-eight. His
final mystery novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">Appleby and the Ospreys</span> (1986). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It has always been possible to make a
gentleman in three generations; nowadays &#8211; when families are smaller
and the upper class has to be recruited hastily &#8211; the thing is done in
two. Nevertheless remote ancestors continue to be prized; the remoter
they are the more proudly we regard them." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">A Comedy of Terrors</font></i><font size="2">, 1940) </font></blockquote>
 

<p>Stewart published some 50 mystery novels, short stories, several novels 
and  studies in literature, biographies, and plays. His best known 
detective character  is John Appleby, whose cases took him onto the campuses of the great universities 
or to chase criminals in the tradition of <a href="buchan.htm">John Buchan</a>,
Stewart's fellow Scot. During his career Appleby rises from inspector
to knighted commissioner. Over
the years he also acquires a wife, sculptor Judith Raven. Appleby has
good manners, he likes to quote poetry, and seldom takes fingerprints.
Later
Stewart replaced Appleby by his son Bobby as in the novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> An Awkward Lie</span> 
(1971); the attempt was less successful.  
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Death at the Chase&nbsp;</span>
(1970) Stewart took up the theme of guilt and redemption. On country
walk Appleby has an encounter with the lord of a neighbouring manor,
the aged Martyn Ashmore. He learns that during the war Ashmore was
captured by the Nazi's and cracked under torture. This led to the
massacre of many Resistance fighters. Ever since, on the anniversary of
that day, an attempt is made on Ashmore's life. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'What we're considering is that there may
be a kind of joke at the heart of it,' Appleby said. 'A thoroughly evil
joke. But you're absolutely right about the criminal mind &#8211; or rather
about any mind wrought to plan and perpetrate something like murder.
Calculation and rationality can suddenly go by the board, and something
quite unpremeditated, and even quite profitless and meaningless, take
their place. That's why detective stories are of no interest to
policemen. Their villains remain far too consistently cerebral.' </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Death at the Chase</font></i><font size="2">)</font> 
</blockquote>

<p>A new series character appeared in the 1970s. He was the painter and reluctant detective
Charles Honeybath, whose clients are usually successful businessmen. The artist sleuth  was introduced
 in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mysterious Commission</span> (1975).<span style="font-style: italic;">
The New Sonia Wayward</span>
(1960) was a humorous story about creative writing. Sonia Wayward,
bestselling romantic novelist, dies of a sudden stroke. Her husband,
Colonel Ffolliot Petticate, realizes that to maintain his comfortable
way of living, Sonia's litetary output must continue. Stewart's
attempts as a 'serious' novelist did not gain such acclaim
as his mysteries. His model was C.P. Snown and Henry James, whose style
influenced his essay <span style="font-style: italic;">Mark Lambert's Supper</span>.  Stewart's
other works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Eight Modern Writers&nbsp;</span> (1962), his paramount academic contribution to the <i>Oxford History of English Literature</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rudyard Kilpling</span> (1966), <span style="font-style: italic;">Thomas Hardy: A Critical Biography</span> (1972). Stewart's autobiography
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Myself and Michael Innes</span> came out in 1987.</p>
