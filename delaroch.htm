<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>


<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> Canadian author, whose popular Jalna
saga has been translated into many languages. Mazo de la Roche's first
book in the series was published in 1927 &#8211; in total it consists of 16
volumes and made her one of the most popular novelists. The series,
which covers 100 years of the wealthy Whiteoak family history, is
partly based on de la Roche's own family and the family of her first
cousin Caroline Clement. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"If you drink wine and dance about a fire
like pagans, what will your grandchildren do when they set out to have
a good time? They'll probably get drunk on gin and dance naked. Manners
and morals are never at a standstill. Either they rise or they decline.
Like Empires." </b></font><font size="2">(in <i>The Building of Jalna</i>, 1944 ) </font></blockquote>
<p>Mazo Roche (she later added the 'de la' to her name) was born in
Newmarket, in rural Ontario, the setting for most of her fiction. She
was the only child of William Roche, a salesman, and Alberta (Lundy)
Roche, a carpenter. During her marriage, Alberta moved seventeen times,
due to her husband's many jobs. From 1885 to 1991 the family lived in
Toronto, and then moved to Galt and Orillia, and returned to Toronto in
1895. Until 1900, they lived at 157 Dunn Avenue and from 1900 to 1911
they resided in a house on Jarvis Street. De la Roche described the
building in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ringing the Changes</span>
(1957): "It stood in what was at that time one of the most spacious and
fashionable streets in Toronto. I do not remember when it began to
degenerate but its downhill trend has been steady. In my youth it
represented solid dignity and presceful permanence." </p>
<p>When de la Roche was seven, William and Alberta adopted her orphaned
cousin, Caroline Clement, who became her lifelong companion. In her
childhood, she spent for a period on a farm owned by a wealthy man who
farmed as a hobby. There de la Roche began to develop her fantasy world
of rural aristocracy, which she developed with Caroline. At the age of
nine, she wrote her first story. H. (Rache) Lovat Dickson, de la
Roche's close friend and editor later said, that the Whiteoaks were
"idealized conceptions of ancestors whom she only just knew but had
heard about, but if she hadn't had the sort of family background that
she had, then she couldn't have written the sort of books that the
Whiteoaks books are." On graduation from high school, de la Roche
studied at the Ontario College of Art and English at the University of
Toronto. From 1911 to 1915 the Roche family lived at Foxleigh Farm,
Cudmore Road and Highway 2, near Bronte, Ontario. </p>
<p>In 1902 de la Roche published her first story in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>,
but it was not until recovering from a nervous breakdown, that she
devoted herself to writing. Caroline Clement, who worked as a civil
servant, was the bread winner of the household. De la Roche's father
died in 1915 and mother in 1920; they never knew their daughter's
successes as a writer. Her early works, such as<span style="font-style: italic;"> Possession</span> (1923) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Delight</span> (1926), were romantic novels. At the age of 48, de la Roche published <span style="font-style: italic;">Jalna</span> (1927), her third novel, which brought her 
success. It won<i> Atlantic Monthly</i>'s $10,000 Book Award, and gained huge popularity. The story, set in the 1920s, 
introduces the family a year or so before the 100th birthday of its matriarch, an arrogant, crancy woman, Adeline. 
By the last chapter, all conflicts are resolved. Originally <i>Jalna </i>was
intended to stand alone, but the critical acclaim inspired the author
to produce at a steady rate sequels and prequels, which also caught the
attention of film producers at the RKO Radio Pictures. However, John
Cromwell's screen version of the book from 1935 was characterized in <i>Variety</i> as "a nice production of a not very good adaptation." </p>
<p>Prior becoming famous, de la Roche lived in her early 30s at the
Sovereign House. Built between 1825 and 1846, it was saved from
demolition by the Bronte Historical Society and the Town of Oakville,
and moved to Town parkland in 1988. This house de la Roche incorporated
in<i> Possession</i>, her first novel. With Caroline Clement, she
acquired in the early twenties a small summer cottage at Clarkson, near
Oakville, and became friends with the family of the young poet Dorothy
Livesay. Between the years 1930 and 1940, she spent longer and shorter
periods in England, where she occupied for some years Vale House,
Windsor. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, de la Roche
returned to Toronto. </p>
<p>In the 1920s, when Jalna series was launched, the family saga was a
well-established formula. But few authors have focused on the same
characters for 30 years, like de la Roche did. The Whiteoak family
include Adeline Whiteoak, her grandson Renny, his half-brother Eden,
who nearly bankrupts the family, and Eden's wife Alayne, an American
woman who loves Renny. And there are a number of spouses, ex-spouses,
and spouses-to-be. Archer, Alayne's son, summarizes the theme: "The
family has been the structure of all our lives. We don't think about
it. It's like the air we breathe. It is sacred to us." The family
history begins in the 1850s when a British soldier, Philip Whiteoak and
his wife Adeline build a family residence in Clarkson, Ontario, and
give it the Indian name Jalna. During the story Adeline becomes a 100
year old matriarch, who sees generations come and go. Renny, the master
of Jalna, is not always particularly likeable. Although Renny himself
shows scant tolerance of artistic pursuits, one of his half-brothers is
a poet, one becomes a concert pianist, and one a monk and then later an
actor. </p>



<p>De la Roche lived with Caroline Clement a fairly reclusive life; their relationship was not discussed widely in the press. 
In 1931 they adopted two English children, a boy and a girl. The children were raised primarily by servants and attended 
private schools.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Growth of a Man</span> (1938) was based on the life of another cousin, the Vancouver lumber magnate H.R. MacMillan. 
De la Roche also wrote travel books, children's stories, drama, and her autobiography <i>Ringing the Changes</i>, which was 
published four years before her death.  "It seems to me that even to biographers can make an enigma," 
de la Roche said, "a mystery of any man, no matter how open his life." </p>

<p>When not writing, de la Roche traveled extensively. She journeyed to
the United States and western Canada and made nearly twenty sea
voyages, from the Caribbean to North Africa to Europe. De la Roche died
in Toronto on July 12, 1961. She was buried in St. George's churchyard,
Jackson's Point, Ontario. By the end of her life, eleven million copies
of the Jalna books had been sold in English and more than a dozen other
languages. </p>
<p>De la Roche's play <span style="font-style: italic;">Whiteoaks</span>
(1936) ran in London over 800 performances, and was also produced on
Broadway at the Hudson Theatre. In the original cast, Ethel Barrymore
played Grandma Adeline, the central character of the play. Nancy Price,
an actress, painter, and author, had the role of Adeline in the BBC TV
production <i>Whiteoaks</i> (1951). Before  acting in films, Nancy Price had a successful career in theater; she had  also been in the stage version of <i>Whiteoaks</i> in the London Little Theatre. A thirteen-hour-long CBS television series, 
<i>The Whiteoaks of Jalna</i>, adapted by Timothy Findley, Claude Harz, and Grahame Woods,  was aired in 1972. 
The cast included Kate Reid, Paul Harding, and Amelia Hall. 

 In addition to these productions, a French television production, starring Danielle Darrieux as Adeline, appeared in 1994. </p>
<p>De la Roche's melodrama about the intrigues, loyalties, and sexual
irregularities of an upper-class family anticipated the modern
soap-opera. Today her work is admired for its strong, optimistic
characters and sense of place. With the Jalna saga de la Roche created
a rich fantasy world which has ensured its place in the Hall of Fame of
popular fiction. In 1976, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of
Canada recognized Mazo de la Roche as a national historic person. </p>
