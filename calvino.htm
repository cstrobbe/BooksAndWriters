<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Journalist, short story writer and
novelist, experimental writer whose imaginative fabulations made him
one of the most important Italian fiction writers of the 20th century.
Calvino's career as a writer spanned nearly four decades. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"After forty years of writing fiction,
after exploring various roads and making diverse experiments, the time
has come for me to look for an overall definition of my work. I would
suggest this: my working method has more often than not involved the
subtraction of weight. I have tried to remove weight, sometimes from
people, sometimes from heavenly bodies, sometimes from cities; above
all I have tried to remove weight from the structure of stories and
from language."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Six Memos for the Next Millennium</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font></blockquote>

<p>Italo Calvino was born in Santiago de las Vegas, Cuba. "I will begin
by saying that I was born under the sign of Libra," he once said.
(Libra is the 7th sign of the zodiak, operative September 24-October
23; the word for book in Italian is libro.) Both of his parents, Mario
and Eva Calvino, were botanists. Calvino moved with his family in Italy
in his youth and spent his early years in San Remo, where his father
was the curator of the botanical gardens. Between 1941 and 1947 Calvino
studied at the University of Turin. In 1940, he was drafted into the
Young Fascists and participated in the Italian occupation of the French
Riviere, but at the age of nineteen he left and sought refuge in the
Alps. There he joined the Communist Resistance in the Ligurian
mountains. From these experiences he drew inspiration for his first
stories. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The sea rose and fell against the rocks
of the mole, making the fishing boats sway, and dark-skinned men were
filling them with red nets and lobster pots for the evening's fishing.
The water was calm, with just a slight continual change of color, blue
and black, darker farthest away. I thought of the expanses of water
like this, of the infinite grains of soft sand down there at the bottom
of the sea where the currents leave white shells washed clean by the
waves." </b></font><font size="2">(from 'The Argentine Ant' in </font><i><font size="2">Adam, One Afternoon</font></i><font size="2">, 1949) </font></blockquote>
<p>After the war Calvino graduated from the University of Turin and worked for the communist periodical <i>L'Unitá </i>in 1945 as a journalist and for <i>Einaudi </i>publishing house from 1948 to 1984. He wrote for various periodicals throughout his life, including <i>L'Unitá</i>, <i>La Nostra Lotta</i>, <i>Il Garibaldino</i>, <i>Voce della Democrazia</i>, <i>Il Contemporaneo</i>, <i>Cittá Aperta</i>, and <i>La Republica</i>. </p><p>Following
in the footsteps of Cesare Pavese, Calvino signed up with the
Turin-based publishers Einaudi. Shortly after writing his graduation
thesis on Conrad, Calvino published his first novel, <i>Il sentiero dei nidi di ragno</i>
(1947, The Path to the Nest of Spiders), about resistance movement seen
through the eyes of a young boy and in Neorealistic manner. The work
was noted for its fablelike twists in the narrative. <i>Il visconte dimezzato</i>
(1952,&nbsp;The Cloven Viscount) marked Calvino's break with the common
themes connected with the experience of war. It told the story of a man
cut in half by a cannonball during the Turkish-Christian war.
The&nbsp;appearance of the novel provoked a debate of realism by the
Italian Communist party. </p>
<p>In the 1950s published fantastic
tales, hovering between allegory and pure fantasy, brought Calvino international acclaim and established his reputation
as one of the most important Italian fiction writers of the 20th century.
<i> Il visconte dimezzato</i> was followed by <i>Il barone rampante</i>
(1957, The Baron in the Trees), in which an 18th-century baron's son
climbs a tree and ends up spending his life in various treetops. <i>Il cavaliere inesistente</i> (1959,&nbsp; The Non-Existent Knight),&nbsp;the last book of the trilogy <em>Our Ancestors</em>,
which gave precedence to fantasy outside the general neorealistic vein.
Behind the playful spinning of tales also can been seen Calvino's
questioning about the relationship between the individual conscience
and the course of history. However, in <i>La nuvola di smog </i>(1958,
Smog) the author returned for awhile to the social-realistic mode to
satirize the industrial society. Written in the first person, the
unnamed narrator is involved with a newspaper which dealt with
pollution and the environment.</p><p>Between 1955 and 1958 Calvino had
an affair with the actress Elsa de' Giorgi, who was married to Count
Sandro Contini Bonacossi. Excepts from his letters were published in an
article in the Milan daily <i>Corriere della Sera</i> in 2004. While
living in France, Calvino met the Argentinian translator Esther Judith
Singer (nicknamed Chichita), who worked at UNESCO headquarters. They
were married in 1964 in Havanna.</p><p>In the post-1956 period, marked
by the events in Hungary which were to cause Calvino to leave the
Italian Communist Party, Calvino devoted himself more to journalism
than to fiction; he also continued to write for <i>Il contemporaneo</i>,
a Marxist weekly. When Calvino left the Party he felt deeply distressed
and wrote: "Having grown up in times of dictatorship, and being
overtaken by total war when of military age, I still have the notion
that to live in peace and freedom is a frail kind of good fortune that
might be taken away from me in an instant." In one article Calvino
asked, "Was I Stalinist Too?"&nbsp;Though Calvino gave numerous
interviews, he rarely discussed his private life; he was a solitary
person, who stuttered,&nbsp;spoke haltingly, and&nbsp;felt out of place
in his times. </p>
<p>From 1959 to 1967 Calvino edited with Elio Vittorini the magazine<i> Il Menabó di letteratura. </i>In
1952 he travelled to the Soviet Union and in 1959-60 to the United
States, saying in his American diary: "Very attractive women are rare.
On the whole they are <em>petite-bourgeois</em>." In 1967 he moved to Paris, where he became acquainted with the activities of Oulipo, led by <a href="quene.htm">Raymond Queneau</a> and François LeLionnais. After moving back to Italy, he settled in Rome in 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>Marcovalco </i>(1963),
a collection of fables, Calvino satirized the modern, destructive urban
way of living. Marcovalco is a Chaplinisque character, an ordinary
working man and a father, who desperately longs for beauty and sinks in
his daydreams whenever he can. When everybody leaves the city in
August, he enjoys the empty streets. His peace is interrupted by a
television group &#8211; it wants to interview the only person who is not on
holiday. </p>
<p>Calvino visited New York first time in 1959 and came to regard it as "my city." 
<b><font size="2">
</font></b>His 'American Diary 1959-60' consisted of letters written to
colleagues. Calvino was amazed of the size of the fridges and how
ignorant Americans were of Italian writing. In 1964 he went to Paris to
strengthen his ties with the latest innovative trends. <i>Le cosmicomiche</i>
(1965, Cosmicomics) set the concepts of evolution against cosmic
scales. Through the boasting accounts of Qfwfq, who is as old as the
universe, Calvino questions all the basic concepts of scientific
theories. Qfwfq changes constantly &#8211; it has been a fish, and the last
dinosaur. When his dear friend says, "Boys, the noodles I would make
for you!" this outburst of general love initiates "at the same moment
the concept of space and, properly speaking, space itself, and time,
and universal gravitation, and the gravitation universe, making
possible billions and billions of suns, and of planets, and fields of
wheat..." In <i>Il Castello dei destini incrociati</i> (1973, The
Castle of Crossed Destines) Calvino found his source of inspiration in
two ancient packs of tarot cards. The novel represented a type of open
text that allows for a similar variety of possible readings. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Waiting in line, Mr Palomar contemplates
the jars. He tries to find a place in his memories for cassoulet, a
rich stew of meats and beans, in which goose-fat is an essential
ingredient; but neither his palate's memory nor his cultural memory is
of any help to him. And yet the name, the sight, the idea attract him,
awaken an immediate fantasy not so much of appetite as of eros: from a
mountain of goose-fat a female figure surfaces, smears white over her
rosy skin, and he already imagines himself making his way towards her
through those thick avalanches, embracing her, sinking with her." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Mr. Palomar</font></i><font size="2">, 1983) </font></blockquote>

<p><em>Le cittá invisibli</em> (1972, Invisible Cities) was a surreal
fantasy in which Marco Polo invents dream-cities to amuse Kubla Khan &#8211;
a city on stilts, a city made of waterpipes, a spiderweb city, a city
that cannot be forgotten and so on. Polo's principle as a storyteller
is: "Falsehood is never in the words, it is in the things."<font size="2"></font>
In Isidore, one of the Cities of Memory, "the foreigner hesitating
between two women always encounters a third, and in Zirma one sees "a
girl walking with a puma on a leash," and one leaves "Tamara without
having discovered it." The Great Khan's labyrinthine empire becomes a
metaphor of the universe itself. Calvino won with the book the
prestigious Premio Felrinelli Award. Of Calvino's <i>If on a Winter's Night a Traveller</i> (1979), <a href="../../../rushdie.htm">Salman Rushdie</a> declared: "He is writing down what you have always known except that you've never thought of it before."</p>
<p><i>Le cittá invisibili </i><i></i>concist of a conversation between
an imaginary Marco Polo and an imaginary Kublai Khan. Marco Polo
describes a series of surreal cities in the Khan's domain. Each city is
charactericized by a unique quality or concept and they are all named
for women. The novel is divided into nine parts. The first and last
parts contain five vignettes between the framing narratives. The old
and Khan tries to find significance from Marco Polo's fragmented tales,
but the true story is the ongoing debate between the visionary Marco
and the skeptical Kublai &#8211; hope versus despair.</p>
<p><i>In Se una notte d'inverno unviaggiatore</i> ( If on a Winter's
Night a Traveller) the story alternates the opening chapters of 10
different novels, and opens with a man discovering that the copy of the
novel he has recently purchased is defective, a Polish novel having
been bound within its pages. When he returns to the bookshop he meets a
young woman, and they find out that their texts are 10 exerpts that
parody the genres of conteporary fiction. The book includes instalments
of a discourse on the experience of reading. Responsible for the 10
opening chapters might be a literary translator, whose intrigues the
fantastical narrative concerns. Calvino seems to consider reading over
writing. </p>
<p>Calvino died of cerebral hemorrhage in Siena, on September 19, 1985. His later essays<em> Le lezioni americane</em>
&#8211; about five central qualities of good fiction: lightness, quickness,
exactitude, visibility, and multiplicity &#8211; were published posthumously.
From the collection<i> Under a Jaguar Sun</i> (1991), stories on the
five senses, 'sight' and 'touch,' were never completed. About sight he
once said: "Actually, I have been writing about visibility my whole
life." In <i>The Uses of Literature</i> (1980) Calvino noted that
there should be a time "in adult life devoted to revisiting the most
important books of our youth. Even if the books have remained the same
(though they do change, in the light of an altered historical
perspective), we have most certainly changed, and our encounter will be
an entirely new thing." <b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"></font></p>
