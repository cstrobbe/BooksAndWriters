<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Leading American essayist and literary
stylist
of his time. White was known for his crisp, graceful, relaxed style.
"No one can write a sentence like White," James Thurber once stated.
White's stories ranged from satire to children's fiction. While he
often wrote from the perspective of slightly ironic onlooker, he also
was a sensitive spokesman for the freedom of the individual. Among his
most enduring essays is 'Once More to the Lake.' </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am the holder of a quit-claim deed
recorded in Book 682, Page 501, in the country where I live. I hold
Fire Insurance Policy Number 424747, continuing until the 23 day of
October in the year nineteen hundred forty-five, at noon, and it is
important that the written portions of all policies covering the same
property read exactly alike."</b> (from 'About Myself', 1945)</font></blockquote>

<p>Elwyn Brooks White was born in Mount Vernon, New York, the son of
Samuel White, a prosperous piano manufacturer, and Jessie (Hart) White;
she was forty-one and Samuel was forty-five. Elwyn was the youngest
child of a large family, where parents really loved children. On
Elwyn's twelfth birthday his father wrote to him: "You are the object
of the affectionate solicitude of your mother and father. Then you have
been born a Christian. When you reflect that the great majority of men
are born in heathen lands in dense ignorance and superstition it is
something to be thankful for that you have the light that giveth life."
</p>
<p>White once said, that he was a busy writer long before he went into
long pants. After graduating from Cornell University in 1921, White
worked in some miscellaneous jobs, such as reporter for United Press,
American Legion News Service, and the <i>Seattle Times</i>,
from which he was dismissed. The dismissal was no reflection on his
ability, but his style and devotion to writing simply did not suit the
paper. "I was a literary man in the highest sense of the term, a poet
who met every train," he said in his journal. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1923 White returned to New York. For a period he worked as
a production assistant and advertising copywriter before joining the
newly established <i>New Yorker</i><i>.</i> There he met his wife,
Katherine Sergeant Angell, who was the
magazine's literary editor. They married in 1929. John Updike once said
that she was "gifted with that terrible clear vision some women have
(the difference between a good and bad story loomed like a canyon in
her vision), yet not burdened by it, rather rejoicing in it and modest
and humortous in her firmness." White's 'Child's Play,' which appeared
in the last issue of 1925, marked the emergence of a new and original
voice in the world of media. Charlie Chaplin called it "one of the best
humor things he had read." In the story a waitress in a crowded
restaurant spills a glass of buttermilk on the suit of the author, who
refuses to be embarrassed but comforts the tearful waitress. For 11
years White wrote
for the magazine editorial essays and contributed verse and other
pieces. Among the other journalists with whom White and his wife become
close
friends were <a href="dparker.htm">Dorothy Parker</a>, Robert Benchley, James Thurber, and Stephen Leacock.<br>
 </p>


<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><i><font size="2"><a href="thoreau.htm">Walden</a></font></i> <font size="2"><b>is
the only book I own, although there are some others unclaimed on my
shelves. Every man, I think, reads one book in his life, and this one
is mine. It is not the best book I ever encountered, perhaps, but it is
for me the handiest, and I keep it about me in much the same way one
carries a handkerchief &#8211; for relief in moments of defluxion or despair."</b> (White in </font><i><font size="2">The New Yorker</font></i><font size="2">, May 23, 1953) </font></blockquote>

<p>From 1929 White employed <i>The New Yorker</i>'s weekly magazine,
remaining in its staff for the rest of his career. Though he wanted to
be read, he did not seek the approval of the "literary" world and was
not interested in the leading members of the avant-garde of his
generation. A few doors down the street on which he lived in the
Greenwich Village, was the office of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dial</span>,
edited by Marianne Moore, who published the poems of T.S. Eliot,
William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, and others. However,
though modernist aestheticism was not the source of inspiration for
White's work, he probably read E.E. Cummings's humorous pieces from <span style="font-style: italic;">Vanity Fair</span>. <br>
</p>
      <p>White's favorite
subjects were the complexities of modern society, failures of
technological progress, the pleasures of urban and rural life, war, and
internationalism. He was skeptical about organized religion, and
advocated a respect for nature and simple living. White's early
collections of poetry,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Lady Is Cold</span> (1929) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fox of Peapack and Other Poems </span>(1928),
reflected his interest in "the small things of the day" and "the
trivial matters of the heart." From 1938 to 1943 he wrote and edited a
column called 'One Man's Meat' for <i>Harper's </i>magazine. These
collected essays, featuring White's rural experiences, were published
in 1942. Critics hailed this as White's best book to date, but he first
gained wide fame with the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Is Sex Necessary?</span>, which he wrote with his friend and colleague  <a href="thurber.htm">James Thurber</a>. With Katherine Sergeant Angell he published <span style="font-style: italic;">A Subtreasury of American Humour</span> (1941).  <span style="font-style: italic;">One Man's Meat</span>,
which came out in 1942, and was reissued two years later in expanded
form, had a nonstop run of 55 years in print. It was compiled of
White's columns for <i>Harper's </i> with three  essays from <i>The New Yorker</i>. </p>

<p>In 1939 White moved to a farm in North Brooklin, Maine, and
continued his writing career without the responsibilities of a regular
job. He never stopped loving New York, calling it "a riddle in steel
and stone," but he also prophetically saw the vulnerability of the
city: "A single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can
quickly end this island fantasy, burn the towers, crumble the bridges,
turn the underground passages into lethal chambers, cremate millions...
Of all targets New York has a certain clear priority. In the mind of
whatever perverted dreamer might loose the lightning, New York must
hold a steady, irresistible charm."<font size="2"> (from <i>Here is New York</i>, 1949) </font>The barn near White's Maine home  inspired many of the characters in his stories for children. </p>
<p>After World War II White became an enthusiastic editorial supporter of  internationalism and the United Nations, 
publishing an collection of essays under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wild Flag&nbsp;</span>
(1946). In the essay 'The Ring of Time' (1956) he dealt with
segregation. He tells how he explained to his cook, who was from
Finland, that in the American Southland she should sit in one of the
front seats &#8211; the seats in back are reserved for colored people. "Oh, I
know &#8211; isn't it silly," was her reply and White concludes: "The Supreme
Court said nothing about silliness, but I suspect it may play more of a
role than one might suppose. People are, if anything, more touchy about
being thought silly than they are about being thought unjust. . . .
Probably the first slave ship, with Negroes lying in chains on its
decks, seemed commonsensical to the owners who operated it and to the
planters who patronized it. But such a vessel would not be in the realm
of common sense today. The only sense that is common, in the long run,
is the sense of change &#8211; and we all instinctively avoid it, and object to the passage of time, and would rather have none of it." </p>
<p>In 1959 White published  a standard style manual for writing,<span style="font-style: italic;">
The Elements of Style</span>, which  became a mainstay of high-school and 
college English courses in the U.S. The work was based on Prof. William Strunk Jr.'s privately printed book, 
<i>Little Book</i>, which had gone out of print. White, who had been
Strunk's student at Cornell, revised the original adding a chapter and
expanding some of the other content. Later Strunk &amp; White's <i>The Elements of Style</i>
was revised several times. The famous manual, with its timeless
observations, is still considered an exemplar of the principles it
explains. "A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph
no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should
have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary part." White's
essay ´'Will Strunk', published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, now serves as the intro to the book.</p>
<p>Between writing columns, White also published  children's books.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Stuart Little</span> (1945) depicted an independent and 
adventurous child, the size of mouse, who is born into a human family. After various adventures Stuart goes in 
search of a bird whose life he had previously saved.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Charlotte's Web</span> (1952) was about the friendship between a young 
pig, Wilbur, and a spider, Charlotte A. Cavitica. She craftily saves him from the butcher's knife through the message, 
''Some Pig,''  she weaves in her web &#8211; only to die alone. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Trumpet of the Swan&nbsp;</span>
(1970) a mute swan learns to trumpet and becomes a celebrity. In these
works White explored such themes as loyalty, tolerance, and rural
living. They have become for many young readers unforgettable guides
into the world of fiction. </p>
<p>E.B. White died of Alzheimer disease on October 1, 1985 in North
Brooklin, Maine. He was awarded the gold medal for essays and criticism
of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and a Pulitzer Prize
special citation in 1978. He held honorary degrees from seven American
colleges and universities and was a member of the American Academy. </p>
