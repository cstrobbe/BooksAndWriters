<p>Canadian short story writer and novelist, often characterized as a
Canadian Chekhov, although her characters are not Chekhovian in the
sense that they were passive and powerless to change their lives. Munro
describes sensitively the lifestyles, customs, and values of ordinary
people, often revealing in the process hidden meanings and personal
tragedies. Although Munro's stories deal with the lives of women, her
stance is not explicitly feminist. Munro has been mentioned as a
contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"This nun had smiled once in a while to
show that her religion was supposed to make people happy, but most of
the time she looked out at her audience as if she believed that other
people were mainly in the world for her to boss around."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage</font></i><font size="2">, 2001)</font></blockquote>

<p>Alice Munro was born Alice Laidlaw in Wingham, Ontario, where she
grew up on a farm with her sister and brother. Her ancestors &#8211; the
Scots Presbyterian Laidlaws and the Irish Anglican Chamneys &#8211; had
arrived in Upper Canada&nbsp;after the end of the Napoleonic wars.
Among the Laidlaw relatives left behind in Scotland was the poet and
prose writer James Hogg (1770-1835), a friend of Byron, Wordsworth, and
Southey. Before taking up farming, Munro's father, Robert Eric Laidlaw,
had raised foxes and minks and worked as a watch-man. Anne Clarke
Laidlaw (née Chamney), Munro's mother, had been a teacher. She suffered
from Parkinson's disease and died in 1959. </p>
<p>Munro was expected to continue the farming business, but when she
was 12, she decided to become a writer&nbsp;&#8211; "my oddity just shone out
of me;" she once said. At the age of eighteen, Munro won a scholarship
to the University of Western Ontario. In 1951 she married a fellow
student, James Munro, and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. In the
early 1960s, the family moved to Victoria, where Munro founded with her
husband a successful bookstore. </p>

<p>Munro's first story, 'The Dimensions of a Shadow',&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1950. The CBSB bought and broadcast 'The Strangers' in
October 1951 and her work appeared in such magazines as <em>Mayfair</em>, the <em>Canadian Forum</em>, <em>Queen's Quarterly</em>, <em>Chatelaine</em>, and the <em>Tamarack Review</em>,
but it was no until 1968, that her first collection of short stories
was published by Ryerson Press. "I never intended to be a short-story
writer," Munro once said. The book, <i>Dance of the Happy Shades</i>,
was awarded Canada's prestigious Governor General's Award. Several of
the stories had earlier been published in periodicals and drew on
Munro's own childhood experience. "The short story is alive and well in
Canada," wrote Martin Levin in <i>The New York Times</i> <font size="2">(September 23, 1973)</font>, "where most of the 15 tales originate like a fresh winds from the North." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The street is shaded, is some places, by
maple trees whose roots have cracked and heaved the sidewalk and spread
out like crocodiles into the bare yards. People are sitting out, men in
shirt-sleeves and undershirts and women in aprons - not people we know
but if anybody looks ready to nod and say, "Warm night," my father will
nod and say something the same."</b> (from 'Walker Brothers Cowboy', in </font><i><font size="2">Dance of the Happy Shades</font></i><font size="2">, 1968) </font></blockquote>

<p>Munro's second book, <i>Lives of Girls and Women</i> (1971), was a
cycle of interlocked stories about the childhood of a young woman, who
wants to become a writer. Her portrait of the artist as a young girl
gained international attention and was also made into a television
movie, starring Munro's daughter Jenny. </p>

<p>Munro marriage broke down in 1972. She returned to southern Ontario,
and married Gerald Fremlin, a geographer, whom she had known as a
student.&nbsp; They&nbsp;moved into&nbsp;a white frame house, with
nasturtiums, raspberry canes, a birdbath, and trees in the backyard.
Referring to Flaubert she once said, "Live an orderly way like a
bourgeois so that you can be violent and original in your work." <i>Something I&#8217;ve Been Meaning to Tell You</i> from 1974 collected together pieces published in magazines such as 
the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Viva</i> and <i>Redbook</i>.
The author was first unhappy with the book, and pulled it from the
presses for restructuring. In Britain the work was published as a
novel. Munro's third collection, however, contains some of her finest
stories, including 'Wild Swans', 'Mischief' and 'Simon's Luck.' Also in
<i>Who Do You Think You Are?</i>
(1978), which followed the lives of two women, Rose and Flo, her
stepmother, the tales were interlinked. Rose leaves the small town of
Hanratty in Ontario, marries well, and becomes a successful television
actress, but eventually she returns to take care of Flo, who has always
been comfortable with her place in the world. </p>

<p>From the beginning, Munro has been true to her own literary style
and voice. Generally her stories are set in small towns in southern
Ontario and British Columbia. Her style has been described as
beautifully transparent; it is unsentimental and detailed as in a
photograph, much is left unsaid, but at the same time the undercurrents
are oddly poignant and disturbing. The past is always present in the
here and now. "The complexity of things -- the things within things --
just seems to be endless," Munro has said. "I mean nothing is easy,
nothing is simple." As a rule, Munro's characters are people we meet
every day, but their choices are not obvious. Sometimes a small
incident changes the course of their lives, gives it a new perspective,
or provides a key piece to the story. </p><p>Munro has received the
Governor General's Award for Fiction three times. The short film
adaptation of her story 'Boys and Girls' won an Oscar in 1984. Munro
received in 1990 the Canada Council Molson Prize for lifetime
contributions to her country's cultural life. In 2009, she won the
£60,000 Man Booker International prize.</p>
