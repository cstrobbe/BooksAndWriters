      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Norwegian writer who was
awarded
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928. Undset is best-known for her
novels about life in the Scandinavian countries during the Middle Ages.
Her early fiction dealt with contemporary subjects, problems of city
women. Often her heroines face tragic consequences when they are
unfaithful for their true inner self or idealistically challenge
traditional gender roles. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>"The sun was shining but it had
rained hard during the night so the streams were splashing and singing
everywhere on the hillsides, and wisps of fog drifted below the
mountain slopes. But above the crests, white fair-weather&nbsp;clouds
climbed into the blue sky, and Lavrans and his men said it
was&nbsp;going to be a hot day later on."</strong> (from <em>Kristin
Lavransdatter I</em>, 1920,&nbsp;translated by Tiina Nunnally) &nbsp;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Sigrid Undset was born in Kalundborg, Denmark, the eldest
daughter of Ingvald, an archeologist, and Anna Charlotte, the daughter
of a Danish attorney. Through his father's influence, Undset developed
a fascination with medieval history and sagas, ballads, and mythology
of Scandinavia. From her mother Undsed derived realistic view of life
in general, but she never shared her mother's critical attitude toward
religion. When she was two years old, the family moved to Christiania
(now Oslo), Norway, where her father took a position at the
university.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A defining moment in&nbsp;Undset's childhood was when&nbsp;a
family friend gave&nbsp;her a copy of <em>Njals Saga</em>. Its <span class="st"><span class="ft">story absorbed&nbsp;her so much that she
lost all other awareness: "I could see it all so clearly that it hurt.
Skarphedin, with his black eyes and pale face&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font>
beautiful eyes, but an ugly mouth <font face="Symbol">-</font>
reckless, unpredictable . . . " </span></span>Ingvald Undset died in
1893, at the age of forty, and the family's financial situation
deteriorated. Undset's mother sold her husband's collection of books
and antiques, many of which Undset later searched for and acquired
back. Ingvald became the model for Lavrans Bjørgulfsson in <em>Kristin Lavransdotter</em>&nbsp; (1920-22). After passing the middle-level exam
at a school run by Ragna Nielsen, a supporter of the suffragist
movement, Undset took a secretarial training course. To support her
mother and two sisters, Undset went to work as a secretary for the
Wisbech Electrical Company, where she worked nine-hour days. </p>
      <p>Undset kept the job for the next ten years, read on her spare
time, and wrote long letters to her Swedish pen pal, Andrea (Dea)
Hedberg. In 1900 she began to work on a historical novel, finishing the
manuscript four years later. With the hope of having it published, she
took it to Gyldenhal Publishing Company in Copenhagen. The legendary
reply of the editor, Peter Nansen, was: "Don't attempt any more
historical novels. You have no talent for it. But you might try writing
something modern." </p>
      <p>Undset's first novel, <em>Fru Marta&nbsp;Oulie</em>,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1907, after the publishing house of H. Aschehoug &amp; Co.
had first rejected it. "I have been unfaithful to my husband,"
confessed the protagonist in the story of marital infidelity, which
shocked some critics. The novel was followed by a collection of short
stories, <em>Den&nbsp;lykkelige&nbsp;alder</em> (1908). The short
novel, <em>Fortællingen om Viga-Ljot of Vigdis</em>&nbsp;(1909,
Gunnar's Daughter), was an imitation of Icelandic saga. The protagonist
is a&nbsp;woman, who raises her son to take revenge on the man, who had
ruined her&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> his father. <em>Gunnar's
Daughter</em> earned her a government scholarship. She left her job and
devoted herself entirely to writing. </p>
      <p>Her third novel, <em>Jenny</em> (1911), Undset set in partly
Rome, depicting with enthusiasm the sights of the Eternal City.<b> </b>"Helge
whispered aloud to the city of his dreams, whose streets his feet had
never trod and whose buildings concealed not one familiar soul: "Rome,
Rome, eternal Rome." And he grew shy before his own lonely being, and
afraid, because he was deeply moved, although he knew that no one was
there watching him. All the same, he turned around and hurried down
toward the Spanish Steps."<font size="2"> (from <i>Jenny</i>) </font>The
protagonist is a promising young artist, Jenny Winge, who tries to
compromise between love and artistic goals. Jenny leaves her indolent
fiancé, Helge Gram, feels attraction to Helge's father, Gert, a failed
artist. He leaves his wife, but Jenny
doesn't want to marry him. She loses her baby who lives six weeks, and
travels to Rome where she commits suicide. </p>
      <p>After the success of her books, Undset began to travel. In
1912 she married the Norwegian painter Anders Castus Svarstad at the
Norwegian consulate in Antwerp, Belgium. She had met him in Rome, where
she had moved after her second novel. Undset returned with Svarstad to
Norway. Svarstad continued his career as an artist, spending most of
his time in his Oslo studio, Undset published several books, took
dutifully care of the home and the children <font face="Symbol">-</font>
three of them from his previous marriage. Eventually they separated in
1919, and Undset settled on a farm in Lillehammer in Gudbrandsdal with
her daughter, Maren Charlotte, who suffered from mental retardation,
and two sons. Her husband and stepchildren become frequent visitors to
the farm, called Bjerkebæk. </p>
      <p>Before publishing her great historical novels, Undset wrote <em>Splinten
av troldspeilet</em> (1917), which focused on the contradictions
between new opportunities for women and their traditional duties. In
1924 she converted to the Roman Catholic faith, and at the same time
had her marriage annulled. In her
later novels, such as <em>Norske helgner</em> (1934), religion plays
an important role, but without dogmatism. Her own religious developed
is seen in<em> Gymnadenia</em> (1929, The Wild Orchid), <em>Den
brændende&nbsp;busk</em> (1930, The Burning Bush), and <em>Den
trofaste hustru</em> (1936, The Faithful Wife). Undset's relationship
with feminism was more ambivalent: her heroines often find fulfillment
in home and family rather than in paid work. </p>
      <p>Undset's first masterwork from the 1920s is the trilogy <i>Kristin
Lavransdottir</i>. It re-created a woman's life in the devout Catholic
Norway of the 13th and 14th centuries. In the first volume, <i>The
Bridal Wreath</i>, Undset depicted Kristin's passage to adulthood.
Kristin is the proud and beautiful daughter of a prosperous landowner,
who marries a basically unworthy man, Erlend. "She understood not
herself why she was not glad&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> it was
as though she had lain and wept beneath a warm covering, and now must
get up in the cold. A month went by <font face="Symbol">-</font> then
two, now she was sure that she had been spared this ill-hap <font face="Symbol">-</font> and, empty and chill of soul, she felt yet
unhappier than before. In her heart there dawned a little bitterness
toward Erlend. Advent drew near, and she had heard neither from or of
him; she knew not where he was."<b><font size="2"> </font></b></p>
      <p><i>The Mistress of Husaby</i>
and <i>The Cross</i> dealt with Kristin's marriage, the love and hate
relationship with her husband, and her final reckoning with God and
succumbing to the Black Death. The novel was followed by a tetralogy,
translated into English as <i>The Master of Hestviken</i>
(1924-27), also a medieval tale, which earned her the Nobel prize. The
protagonist, proud and unyielding Olav, has committed murder <font face="Symbol">-</font> he kills the lover of his fiancée <font face="Symbol">-</font> which he chooses not to confess. In both novel
series "the first sin" shadows the protagonists life. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2">In his presentation speech, Per
Hallström, Chairman of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy,
stated that "<b>the erotic life, the problem common to the two sexes,
which constitutes the centre of Sigrid Undset's psychological interest,
is found again, almost without modifications, in her historical novels.
In this respect, objections naturally come to mind. In medieval
documents, the feminist question is not known; one never finds hints of
the inner personal life which later was to raise this question. The
historian, demanding proofs, has the right to note this discrepancy.
But the historian's claim is not absolute; the poet has at least an
equal right to express himself when he relies on a solid and intuitive
knowledge of the human soul.</b>" Undset did not deliver a Nobel
lecture, but said in her brief acceptance speech that "<b>I write more
readily than speak and I am especially reluctant to talk about myself."
        </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>With the exception of&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Madame Dorthea</em><strong>
      </strong>(1939), the only completed volume of a planned trilogy
set in the 18th century, Undset's later novels dealt with contemporary
society. In most of these works, such as <i>The Wild Orchid&nbsp;</i>
and<i> </i>its sequel <i>The Burning Bush</i>, Undset wove religious
themes in the story. </p>
      <p>In the 1920s, Undset began to earn a comfortable income from
her books. Moreover, she was awarded a lifetime annual author's stipend
from the Norwegian goverment. Her Nobel Prize money, 156,000 kroner,
Undset gave away. Part of it went to a foundation established to help
families with mentally retarded children. Undset sold also her Nobel
medal later, giving the money to the relief effort for Finnish children
after the outbreak of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet
Union in 1939. </p>
      <p>In 1939 Undset lost both her mother and daughter. When Norway
was occupied by the Germans in April 1940, Undset joined the
Resistance. Her elder son, Anders, was killed during a combat in
Gausdal in 1940. A prominent and an outspoken critic of the Nazis, her
books were banned in Germany, and Norwegian authorities advised him to
flee the country. She had barely enough time to pack a suitcase. The
Germans occupied Bjerkebæk for several years. Her writing desk was
chopped up for firewood. </p>
      <p>Undset lived in exile in the United States, in a small
apartment in Brooklyn, New York. Her new acquaintances included the
novelist Willa Cather, who became a great admirer of her novels. Durig
this period, she made lecture tours, which gained much publicity. At
the end of the war, Undset returned to Norway, where she was awarded
the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1947, for her
"distinguished literary work and for her service to her country."
Undset died in Lillehammer, on June 10, 1949. </p>
      <p>Undset combined in her work knowledge of history with a
psychological analysis. With the '"domestic epic," a sweeping drama set
against a carefully studied social background, she broke a new ground.
Undset turned away from the sentimental style of national romanticism
and wanted to re-create the realism of the Icelandic sagas and write so
vividly, that "everything that seem romantic from here <font face="Symbol">-</font> murder, violence, etc becomes ordinary<font face="Symbol"> -</font> comes to life," as the author explained. In
her personal life Undset devoted herself to medieval interests<font face="Symbol"> -</font> she restored house
dating from the year 1000 and dressed in the grown of a Norse matron of
the Middle Ages. In Lillehammer Undset lived a reclusive life and
refused to open the doors of his house to journalists. Undset's
emphasis on women's biological nature, and her view that motherhood is
the highest duty a woman can aspire, has been criticized by feminists
as reactionary. </p>
