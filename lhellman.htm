<p>American playwright and memoirist, who had a lifelong relationship with the mystery writer <a href="dhammett.htm">Dashiell Hammett</a>.
Many of Hellman's characters were based on members of her own family.
Despite writing only 12 plays, Hellman was a leading voice in the
American theatre. She was also active on the political stage and was
included in Richard A. Posner's list of the twentieth century's top 100
public intellectuals.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There are people who eat earth and eat
all the people on it like in the Bible with the locusts. And other
people who stand around and watch them eat."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Little Foxes</font></i><font size="2">, 1939)</font> </blockquote>
<p>Lillian Hellman was born in New Orleans to Julia (Newhouse) Hellman,
who came from Alabama, and Max B. Hellman, from New Orleans. At the age
of five she moved with her family to New York. Half of every year was
spent in New York City and the other half back in Louisiana, at a
boarding house run by her aunts. </p>
<p>Hellman studied at New York University (1922-24) and Columbia
University (1924) without completing a degree. In 1925 she began her
writing career by reviewing books for the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>. Her short stories were published in the magazine <i>The Paris Comet</i>.
Beginning in 1930 Hellman read scripts for MGM in Hollywood. "When I
first went out to Hollywood one heard talk from writers about whoring,"
she once said. "But you are not tempted to whore unless you want to be
a whore." <font size="2">(<i>Playwrights at Work</i>, ed. George Plimton, 2000)</font>
Hellman's marriage (1925-32) to playwright and press agent Arthur Kober
ended in divorce, after which she returned to New York. By that time
she had already started an intimate friendship with Hammett that would
continue until his death in 1961. </p>
<p>"We met when I was twenty-four years old and he was thirty-six in a
restaurant in Hollywood," Hellman recalled. "The five-day drunk had
left the wonderful face looking rumpled, and the very tall thin figure
was tired and sagged. We talked of T.S. Eliot, although I no longer
remember what we said, and then went and sat in his car and talked at
each other and over each other until it was daylight. We were to meet
again a few days later, and, after that, on and sometimes off again for
the rest of his life and thirty years of mine." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The Dashiell Hammett Story Omnibus</font></i><font size="2">, 1962)</font> </p>
<p>Hellman was the inspiration for Hammett's Nora Charles, the loyal
wife of his detective hero Nick Charles. In real life, Hellman had
several affairs during the decades she was close to Hammett, among
others with John Melby, whom she met in Moscow in the 1940s. Many who
knew her found her sensual and attractive, though the actor Walter
Matthau said she was about as "seductive as a large bowl of oatmeal."
She was slim, had brown-reddish hair, sometimes blonde, dressed
elegantly, and was a chain smoker. Hellman heself lamented her "flat
ass", but liked her bosom, or "huge shelf", as Norman Mailer said. (<i><font size="2">Lillian Hellman: A Life with Foxes and Scoundrels</font></i><font size="2"> by Deborah Martinson, 2005) </font>At the age of 71, she posed for the Blackglama fur advertisement in <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>. </p>
<p>In 1929 Hellman made a trip to Europe. As a playwright, Hellman first gained success with <i>The Children's Hour</i>
(1934), a story in which a spoiled child attacks her teachers through
destructive gossip about their lesbianism. Originally the story was
based on a law case which Hellman had found in a book by William
Roughead. According to some sources, it was Hammett who first offered
the&nbsp;idea to Hellman, who lacked inspiration. Hammett helped her
with the writing but he did not attend opening night. </p><p>The case
took place in Edinburgh in the nineteenth century and was about two
old-maid schoolteachers and a little girl who brought charges of
lesbianism against the two teachers. "It's not about lesbians," Hellman
explained to Samuel Goldwyn's story editor, who wanted to buy the
screen rights of the play. "It's about the power of a lie." Despite the
controversial theme, the play ran on Broadway for nearly 700
performances. </p>
<p>Hellman signed&nbsp;in 1935 &nbsp;a three-year contract with
Goldwyn. She became involved in a number of Hollywood projects, which
softened the failure of <i>Days to Come</i> (1936), a play which drew its subject from a labor strike in a Midwestern town. Critics and audienced scorned it. <i>These Three </i>(1936), based on<i> The Children's Hour</i>
and directed by William Wyler, was the first of several collaborations
between Wyler and Hellman. "We had to become friends," she told Goldwyn
biographer Scott Berg, "because we were the only two people in the
Goldwyn asylum who weren't completely loony." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">A Talent for Trouble</font></i><font size="2"> by Jan Herman, 1997)</font> </p><p>In
1936-37 Hellman traveled in Europe. She met Ernest Hemingway and other
American writers living in Paris, visited Spain, where she witnessed
the horrors of the civil war, and traveled in the Soviet Union. To this
period Hellman returned in her first memoir, <i>An Unfinished Woman</i> (1969). According to her biographer William Wright <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Lillian Hellman: The Image, the Woman</font></i><font size="2">, 1986)</font>, she fictionalized much of her adventures. Hellman's political sympathies had turned to the left and in her antifascist play <i>Watch on the Rhine</i>
(1941), Hellman criticized the naiveté of the Americans. While
traveling in Europe, Hellman helped to smuggle $50,000 over the border
for a group who wanted to oust Hitler. </p>
<p>From the mid-1930s, Hellman was irregularly involved in liberal and
leftist activities and organizations. However, she later asserted that
she never joined the Communist Party. Like Sartre in France, Hellman
was not among the first intellectuals who condemned the Soviet system &#8211;
George Orwell's and Arthur Koestler's opinions about Communism had
changed already in the 1930s. During the Cold War Era, Hellman
sympathized with dissidents writers of the Eastern block. </p>
<p>In 1937 Hellman became pregnant with Hammett's child. He divorced
from Josephine Dolan&nbsp;but Hellman abandoned plans to marry him and
had an abortion.&nbsp;<em>The Little Foxes</em> (1939), which restored Hellman's fame&nbsp;after the flop of <em>Days to Come</em>,
is among&nbsp;her best-known works. The chronicle of hatred and greed
among the members of the Hubbard family was partly based on her own
memories of the South. The Goldwyn studio had purchased the rights for
the play after it gained success on Broadway. Arthur Kober, Dorothy
Parker, and Alan Campbell were hired to do the final work on Hellman's
script for William Wyler's film adaptation. The film, starring Bette
Davis, Herbert Marshall, and Teresa Wright, received nine Academy Award
nominations, but didn't win a single Oscar. According to Hellman, the
Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein prized <i>The Little Foxes</i> so highly that he showed it over and over at private parties. </p>
<p><i>The Little Foxes</i> was set in the South in 1900. Brothers Ben
and Oscar Hubbard plan to establish a mill in their town and need
$75,000 for the venture. They ask help from their sister Regina
Giddens, who is married to Horace, the president of the local bank.
Horace, who has only a short time to live, refuses to become involved.
Oscar's son Leo, who is working at the bank, steals bonds to help his
father. Horace discovers the theft but will not prosecute the brothers.
He makes a new will, in which Regina receives only the exact amount of
the theft. Horace dies and Regina blackmails her brothers into
assigning her a 75 percent interest in the mill. Alexandra, her
daughter, discovers her mother's treachery and greed and leaves her
home forever. Hellman returned to the Hubard family history again in
the play <i>Another Part of the Forest</i> (1946), which was set in Alabama in 1880. </p><p>With earnings from <i>The Little Foxes</i>,
Hellman purchased a 130-acre farm in Pleasantville, Westchester County,
NY, which she called "Hardscrabble Farm." Hammett who had helped her to
to write the play, spent much time there with her, but they did not
sleep together.&nbsp;Hellman entertained her own friends and lovers,
when she was not milking cows.</p>
<p>In the 1940s Hellman worked in Hollywood adapting her plays for the screen. She wrote the screenplay for <i>The North Star </i>(1943),
which glorified the heroism of the Russian people in the war against
the Germans. Contrary to the opinion of a number of other writers, she
did not sympathize with the Finns in the Winter War between Finland and
the Red Army in 1939-40 &#8211; the war started by order of Stalin. With
William Wyler, Hellman developed an idea to make a documentary about
the Soviet Union&#8217;s struggle against the Nazi invasion. The Soviet
ambassador Maxim Litvinov and the foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov
promised to supply all the equipment, but Hellman's and Wyler's frayed
relations with Goldwyn stalled the project. Goldwyn promised Hellman to
finance the short film <i>The Negro Soldier</i>. </p>
<p>When Hammett was serving his sentence for refusing to cooperate with
the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, his
lawyer advised Hellman to leave the country. She sailed to Europe with
Wyler, who knew she was broke and paid her fare and hotel bills. </p>
<p>In 1952 Hellman was called to appear before HUAC. She refused to
reveal the names of associates and friends in the theater who might
have Communist associations, but she wasn't charged with contempt of
Congress. In a letter to the Committee she wrote: "But the hurt
innocent people whom I knew many years ago in order to save myself is,
to me, inhuman and indecent and dishonorable. I cannot and will not cut
my conscience to fit this year's fashions, even though I long ago came
to the conclusion that I was not a political person and could have no
comfortable place in any political group..." Hellman was excused by the
committee with the remark: "Why cite her for contempt? After all, she
is a woman..." </p>
<p>Hellman was blacklisted from the late 1940s to the 1960s. When her
income virtually disappeared, she sold her home, the Hardscrabble Farm.
In the 1950s Hellman adapted works from other writers for the stage,
among them Jean Anouilh's play <i>L'Alouette</i> about Joan of Arc, and Voltaire's satire <i>Candide</i>, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Richard Wilbur, John Latouche and Dorothy Parker. Hellman's play <i>Toys in the Attic</i>
(1960), about a Southern man obsessed with grandiose dreams, was filmed
by George Roy Hill.&nbsp; By 1955,&nbsp;she was able to buy an old
cottage on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. She also kept an apartment
in Manhattan.</p>
<p>After the failure of <i>My Mother, My Father and Me </i>(1963) Hellman abandoned writing for the stage, and focused on teaching and writing her memoir trilogy. <i>An Unfinished Woman</i>, which was a bestseller, described her childhood in New Orleans, years in Hollywood, and her relationship with Hammett.<i> Pentimento</i>
(1973), even a greater hit, dealt with her youth and early days in New
York. The most popular section of the book, about her friend Julia who
was trapped by the Nazis, was the basis for the 1977 film adaptation. <i>Scoundrel Time</i> (1976) was an account of her experiences in the 1950s, when she was called to testify on Un-American Activities. </p>
<p>Hellman was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
She taught writing classes at the University of New York, Yale
University, Harvard University, and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. In 1964 The National Institute of Arts and Letters
presented her with the Gold Medal for Drama. In 1976 she was awarded
the MacDowell Medal. Hellman died on June 30, 1984. Before her death,
Hellman had suffered from poor eyesight. She managed to publish in 1980
a little novel about elusiveness of the truth of the past entitled <i>Maybe</i>. In 1984 appeared <i>Eating Together: Recipes and Recollections</i>.
Her life has inspired several biographers. Even Hellman's part-time
housekeeper for one summer, Rosemary Mahoney, has published her
recollections of the author. "She always had the final word," Mahoney
wrote in <i>A Likely Story</i> (1998) on Hellman, whom she saw as "a sea turtle at rest on the ocean floor, dreaming and digesting ..." </p>
