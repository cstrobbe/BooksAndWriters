<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Ugandan poet, anthropologist, and social
critic, who wrote in Luo and in English. Okot P'Bitek was one of the
most vigorous and original voices in East African 20th-century poetry.
His satirical monologues dealt with the conflict between European and
African cultures. In his most famous poem,<i> The Song of Lawino </i>(1966), p'Bitek introduced a style that became known as "comic singing." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Stop despising people </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">As if you were a little foolish man, </font><br>
<font size="2">Stop treating me like saltless ash </font><br>
<font size="2">Become barren of insults and stupidity; </font><br>
<font size="2">Who has ever uprooted the Pumpkin? </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'My Husband's Tongue Is Bitter,' in <i>The Song of Lawino</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>Okot p'Bitek was born in Gulu, Northern Uganda, into a family of Luo people. At that time Uganda was a 
protectorate of the British Empire. P'Bitek's mother was a gifted singer, composer, and leader 
of her clan. 
 Under the influence of his mother, p'Bitek grew up learning the tales, proverbs and songs of 
Acholi folklore 
(sometimes referred to as Lwo or Luo).  
P'Bitek himself was an accomplished dancer and drummer. He attended Gulu High School and King's 
College, Budo, where he wrote and produced theatre and opera. Budo was patterned along the educational 
tradition of  English boy's schools. "What they were teachingus was irrelevant to my experiences 
&#8211; Shakespeares and Shelleys", he said later in life. 
During this period he became familiar with many Acholi songs.</p>
<p>After a two-year course at the Government Training College in
Mbarara, p'Bitek taught at Sir Samuel Baker's School near Gulu. While
still a student, p'Bitek published his first poem, 'The Lost Spear',
based on a traditional Luo folk story, but also influenced by
Longfellow's poem <i>Hiawatha </i>(1855). His first and only novel, <i>Lak Tar Miyo Kinyero Wi Lobo</i>,
p'Bitek published in Luo in 1953. Its title is a proverb, meaning "Our
teeth are white, that's why we laugh at the sorrows of the world." The
story tells about the tragedy of a poor Acholi lad, who struggles hard
to save money to marry his sweet heart, but eventually loses his
savings. </p>
<p>An adept soccer player and a member of the Uganda national team, he
toured Britain in 1956 for a series of games, and decided stay there to
study. P'Bitek took a diploma in education in Bristol, and later he
studied law at the University of Wales at Aberystwyth and social
anthropology at Oxford, where he completed in 1963 a B.Litt. thesis on
the traditional songs of Acoli and Largo. "I first met a number of
western scholars at Oxford University in 1960", p'Bitek recalled his
experiences in the preface to <i>African Religions in Western Scholarship</i>
(1972). "During the very first lecture in the Institute of Social
Anthropology the teacher kept referring to Africans or non-western
peoples as barbarians, savages, primitive tribes etc." Returning to
Uganda at the age of 33, he joined the staff of the Department of
Sociology at Makerere University College in Kampala, the capital city.
Two years later he became a tutor with the Extra-Mural department.
P'Bitek also founded the Gulu and was appointed director of the
National Theatre and National Cultural Centre in Kampala. Later in 1968
in Kenya he founded Kisumu Arts Festivals. His wide circle friends and
acquaintances included such leading poet-musicians of Acholiland as
Omal Adok Too, Goya, Yona Acwaa, Acamu Lubwa Too, Oloyo Acil and Abonga
Bongomin Lutwala. </p>
<p>As a poet p'Bitek made his breakthrough with <i>The Song of Lawino</i>. It was first composed in Luo 
in rhyming couplets and was translated into 
English by the author, who according to his own words clipped a bit of the eagle's wings of the original 
Acholi poem "and rendered 
the sharp edges of the warrior's sword rusty and blunt, and also murdered rhythm and rhyme". Although 
the work was turned down by several British publishers, in 1966 it became a bestseller. A separate American 
edition, by the World Publishing Company, was issued in 1969. The Luo original was published in 1971. P'Bitek's 
friend and colleague Taban lo Liyong published in 2001 a new translation of the poem, <i>The Defense of Lawino</i>,
which aimed to be more faithful to the Acholi original. </p>
 

<p>"It may seem ironical that the first important poem in English to
emerge in Eastern Africa should be a translation from the vernacular
original," wrote Gerald Moore in <i>Transition </i>(no.
31, June-July, 1967). Like p'Bitek's other long poems, it was written
as a story, narrated by one person. However, there are divisions in the
general frame, that suggest individual poems. Lawino, a non-literate
woman, laments her fate in 'My Husband's Tongue is Bitter': "Husband,
now you despise me / Now you treat me with spite / And say I have
inherited the / stupidity of my aunt /". Her university-educated
husband Ocol has adopted Western ways, rejected her, and taken another,
Westernized woman. Lawino claims that he has lost his manhood by
reading books: "Bile burns my inside! / I feel like vomiting! / For all
our young men / Were finished in the forest, / Their manhood was
finished / In the class-rooms, / Their testicles / Were smashed / With
large books!" </p>
<p><i>The Song of Lawino</i> was followed by <i>Song of Ocol</i> (1970),
in which Lawino's husband respons to her. "Mother, mother, / Why, / Why
was I born / Black?" says Ocol eventually in 'What Is Africa to Me?',
revealing his true alienated character. There is no clear answer to the
question, what it means to be African, but in Ocol's Africa age-old
traditions give way to modern values, whereas Lawino is proud of the
traditional way of life and he rejects foreign intrusion. Together
these books form a polemic, oratorical account of the changing times,
dramatized through the accusing voices of marriage conflict. <i>Song of Ocol</i> was directly written in English. <br>
</p>
      <p><a href="ngugiw">Ngugi wa Thiong</a> wrote in <i>Homecoming</i>
(1972), that "Lawino is the voice of the peasantry and her ridicule and
scorn is aimed at the class basis of Ocol's behaviour." However,
p'Bitek's narrators are not only representatives of certain opposing
values and attitudes, but lively personalities, with their
deficiencies, humor, bitterness, and need of understanding. Skilfully
p'Bitek inspires his readers to make conclusions and to create a
synthesis after reading both collections. The author himself belonged
to the generation, that had absorbed early native culture during the
colonial period, but then had received a British education. P'Bitek's
own choice was to take a stand against Western infiltration and defend
Acoli traditions and customs. </p>

<p><i>Two Songs</i> (1971) included <i>Song of a Prisoner</i>, apparently born as a 
response to  
the assassination of the Kenyan politician Tom Mboya, and<i> Song of Malaya</i>, about 
hypocrisy and sexual morals (<i>malaya</i> means "prostitute"). The book, 
dedicated to Patrice Lumumba (1925-1961), the murdered prime minister of the Republic 
of the Congo, was awarded the inaugural Kenyatta Prize for Literature in 1972. All 
these early collections were published by the East African Publishing House. Although 
p'Bitek had dismissed Shelley at Budo as "irrelevant,"  this revolutionary poet, especially 
his <i>The Mask of Anarchy</i> (1819/1832), written after the Peterloo 
Massacre carried out by  British soldiers, influenced his <i>Song of Prisoner</i> and 
<i>Song of Soldier</i>, which he never finished. Idi Amin (also known
as Idi Amin Dada),&nbsp; the ruthless dictator of Uganda from 1971 to
1979, is widely believed to be the "soldier" of the latter song. </p>
<p>P'Bitek 
also published a collection of Acoli traditional songs, <i>The Horn of My Love</i> (1974), 
and a collection of Acoli folktales and short stories, <i>Hare and Hornbill</i> (1978). His 
major academic studies were <i>Religion of the Central Luo</i> (1971), <i>African Religions 
in Western Scholarship</i>, and <i>Africa's Cultural Revolution</i> (1973). P'Bitek was a 
frequent contributor to <i>Transition</i>,
a journal published at Makerere, and other journals. His essays varied
from literary criticism, such as 'The Self in African Imagery,' to
articles on anthropological, sociological, and philosophical topics.
P'Bitek's direct poems and his academic works caused much debate. He
attacked both reactionary modes of thought and the uncritical
acceptance of modernization, and was criticised by British observers
for his Afrocentric views and cultural nationalism, and by feminist
observers, who had trouble in accepting p'Bitek's one-sided satirical
portrayal of African women. </p>
<p>Uganda became an independent member of the Commonwealth in 1962 with
Milton Obote as prime minister. After criticizing the government of
Uganda in Zambia, p'Bitek became persona non grata in his own country
and moved to Kenya. His disillusionment he expressed in the poem 'They
Sowed and Watered,' in which a lamb named Freedom is dead, the cynical
people laugh bitterly, and a young boy who cares, is killed. "The peals
of laughter / Poisoned arrows / Hit the boy like swords of steel / And
blood from his heart / Anointing the land." The rest of his life
p'Bitek spent teaching in Kenya and in the United States. Obote was
overthrown in a miliary coup in 1971, and Idi Amin seized power. During
his reign a huge number of Ugandans were killed and the economy
collapsed. In 1971 p'Bitek became a senior research fellow at the
Institute of African Studies in Nairobi. He also lectured in sociology
and literature at the university. The Amin years P'Bitek spent in
exile, and then returned to Makerere as a professor of creative
writing. He died of a liver infection on July 19, 1982. His daughter,
Jane Okot P'Bitek, is also a writer, whose <i>Song of Farewell</i> (1994, a volume of poetry, was dedicated to the memory of her father. </p>
