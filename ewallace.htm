<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British novelist, playwright, and journalist
who produced popular detective and suspense stories and was in his time
"the king" of the modern thriller. Wallace's literary output &#8211; 175
books, 24 plays,
and countless articles and review sketches &#8211; have undermined his
reputation as a fresh and original writer. Moreover, the author was a
wholehearted supporter of Victorian and early Edwardian values and
mores, which are now considered in some respects politically incorrect.
In England in the 1920s Wallace was said to be the second biggest
seller after the Bible. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"This little autobiography is in itself a
tribute to the system under which we live. There cannot be much wrong
with the society which made possible the rise of J.H. Thomas or Edgar
Wallace, that gave 'Jamie' Brown the status of a king in Scotland and
put Robertson at the War Office as Chief of the Imperial General Staff."</b> (from Wallace's introduction to his autobiography, <i>People; Edgar Wallace: The Biography of a Phenomenon</i>, 1926) </font></blockquote>

<p>Edgar Wallace was born in Greenwich in 1875 &#8211; in the same year as
the creator of the Tarzan novels, Edgar Rice Burroughs. He was brought
up as an adopted child in the family of Dick Freeman, a London fish
porter. His parents were actors, Polly Richards and Richard Horatio
Edgar Marriott, who used the false name of Walter Wallace on the birth
records. At the age of 12, the young Wallace left school and took
menial jobs before enlisting at the age of 18 in the Army. <br>
</p>
      <p>From 1893 to 1896 Wallace served in the Royal West Kent Regiment. Later he wrote in <i>Double Dan </i>(1924)
"He was strictly brought up by parents who compelled him to read books
on Sunday that were entirely devoted to orphans and good organ-grinders
and little girls who quoted extensively from precious books, and died
surrounded by weeping negroes. In such literature the villains of the
piece were young scoundrels who surreptitiously threw away their crusts
and only ate crumb part of bread; desperadoes who kicked dogs, and
threw large flies into spiders' webs, and watched the spider at his
fell work with glee."<font size="2"> </font></p>

<p>In 1896 Wallace was sent to South Africa, where he was in the
Medical Staff Corps. During this period he met the Reverend William
Shaw Caldecott and Mrs. Marion Caldecott, who was a writer and willing
to help Wallace in his literary aspirations. Wallace began to
contribute to various journals, and wrote war poems, later collected in
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mission That Failed</span> (1898) and other volumes. </p>
<p>After his discharge in 1899, Wallace became a correspondent for Reuters and the London <i>Daily Mail</i>.
His reports about Horatio Herbert Kitchnerer infuriated the influential
British fieldmarshal and Wallace was banned as a war correspondent
until World War I. In 1901 he married Ivy Caldecott; they divorced in
1918. Before returning to London, Wallace served in 1902 as the editor
of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> in Johannesburg. </p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05) Wallace was sent by the <i>Daily Mail</i>
to Vigo to examine a conflict in which the Russians opened fire on a
British fishing fleet in the belief that it was the Japanese Navy. On
his journeys he learned about the activities of Russian and English
spies operating around the coasts of Spain and Portugal. Later Wallace
returned to world of secret agents in his stories, although he mostly
concentrated on crime and detective books. His most famous spy story,
'Code No. 2' first appeared in the <i>Stand Magazine</i> of April 1916, then in various collections and anthologies. </p>
<p>Wallace's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Four Just Men</span>
(1905), was printed by his own Tallis Press. It told a story about a
group of rich, intelligent and ruthless conspirators who take the law
into their own hands. Although the book was a huge success, Wallace
lost money on it because of an unlucky publicity gimmick. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Council of Justice</span> (1908), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Just Men of Cordova</span> (1917) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Three Just Men</span> (1925) were sequels to <i>The Four Just Men</i>. </p>
<p>It was not until the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sanders of the River</span>
(1911), about an African representative of Great Britain Foreign
Office, when his fame as a writer was established. Wallace then wrote
several additional stories using his African experiences as background.
His attitudes reflect uncritically popular opinions of the time, which
could be simply characterized under the title "imperialist ideology".
In the stories about Bosambo, a devious tribal king, Mr. Commissioner
Sanders loses often the battle of wits, although Bosambo in one scene
tells that he has always wanted to be a chief under the British rule.
However, he manages to steal Sanders's binoculars. Sanders's method to
keep up peace is straightforward: he uses whip and he has a reputation
for hanging rebellious chiefs. The <i>Sanders of the River</i> stories ran from 1909 until well into the 1920s. </p>
<p> Wallace worked in the 1900s and 1910s in several journals, among them <i>Daily Mail </i>(1903-1907), <i>Standard </i>(1910), <i>The Week-End Racing Supplment </i>(1910-12), <i>Evening News</i> (1910-1912), <i>The Story Journal</i> (1913),<i> Town Topics </i>(1913-16). He was  later a racing columnist for <i>The Star</i> (1927-32) and <i>Daily Mail</i>
(1930-32). During World War I Wallace was a special interrogator for
the War Office. In 1921 he married his secretary and second wife,
Violet King, who was twenty-three years younger than himself, and with
whom he had one daughter. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Green Archer</span> (1923) is
one of the most famous novels of Wallace. It is a story about a man who
is found murdered after a quarrel with the owner of a ghost-haunted
castle. It was filmed at least three times. The critic and awarded
mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mind of Mr. J.G. Reeder </span>(1925) among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987)</font>.
Mr Reeder works for the office of the Public Prosecutor, he is
"something over fifty, a long-faced gentleman with sandy-grey hair and
a slither of side whiskers that mercifully distracted attention from
his large outstanding ears." Supernatural themes do not appear very
often in Wallace's works. Spiritualism and ghosts are dealt in such
short stories as 'Death Watch', filmed in 1933 with Warner Oland, 'The
Ghost of John Holling', filmed in 1934, and 'The Ghost of Down Hill',
later adapted in the sixties for the Edgar Wallace Mystery Theatre
series. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I'm perfectly certain it wasn't a ghost," she said. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">"Oh, you are, are you? his eyes twinkled, "and how do you reach that conclusion?"</font><br>
<font size="2">"</font><font size="2">Ghosts don't wear boots," she said decidedly. </font><br>
<font size="2">"They may have shoes," said the dry old man." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'The Ghost of Down Hill') </font></blockquote>
<p>Wallace wrote his works at a prodigious pace,  among others one of his most popular plays, <span style="font-style: italic;">On the Spot</span> (1931), was finished in four days. The 75,000 word novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Coat of Arms</span> (1931) was penned in a weekend. His autobiography,<span style="font-style: italic;"> People; Edgar Wallace: The Biography of a Phenomenon</span>,
came out in 1926. At the highest peak of Wallace's career in the 1920s,
one of his numerous publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read
in England was written by him. Most of Wallace's novels were spoken
into a dictaphone, typed up by his wife or a secretary, and then
corrected. His skill in creating lively dialogue was noted by film
makers who used eagerly his texts for films. Wallace also wrote
screenplays - among other some dialogue <i>The Hound of Baskervilles</i> (1931), directed by V. Gareth Gundrey. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There is a tradition in criminal circles
that even the humblest of detective officers is a man of wealth and
substance, and that his secret hoard was secured by thieving, bribery
and blackmail. It is the gossip of the fields, the quarries, the
tailor's shop, the laundry and the bakehouse of fifty county prisons
and three convict establishments, that all highly placed detectives
have by nefarious means laid up for themselves sufficient earthly
treasures to make a work a hobby and their official pittance the most
inconsiderable portion of their incomes." </b>(from 'The Treasure Hunt', in </font><i><font size="2">The Mind of Mr. J.G. Reeder</font></i><font size="2">, 1925) </font></blockquote>
<p>Wallace earned extremely well from his writings, but he lost
fortunes because of his extravagant lifestyle and obsessive betting on
the wrong horses. He enjoyed his success, spent much time in Carlton,
London's most expensive hotel, and was magnificently generous. However,
when Wallace's mother had visited him in 1903, he had rejected her. She
died alone in the city hospital. Later Wallace felt deep remorse for
what he had done. Wallace's literary estate was not profitable until
1934. Hundreds of films have been made from his novels and short
stories, also plays and television series in England (1959). <br>
</p>
      <p>In Germany the series of Wallace adaptations became the
nation's most popular screen entertainment. Rialto studios produced for
German audience 32 films from 1959. Among the actors were Klaus Kinski
and the dark, beautiful Finnish born actress Anneli Sauli under the
name Ann Savo. She was among others in <i>Die Toten Augen von London</i> (1961) and in <i>Der Hexer</i> (1964), both directed by Alfred Vohrer. Joachim Kramp has written in <i>Hier spricht Edgar Wallace &#8211; Die Geschichte der deutschen Kriminalserie von 1959-72</i>
more about the film series. In 1960 Jack Greenwood produced in England
a series of short screen adaptations for British and American
television use under the title Edgar Wallace Mystery Theater.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his life, Wallace estimated that his work as a
playwright was more important than his work as a writer of stories. It
was largely the success of the plays&#8211;  <span style="font-style: italic;">The Calendar</span> (1929), On the Spot, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Case of the Frighntened Lady </span>(1931)
&#8211; which led to his being invited to Hollywood to work as a
scriptwriter. Just before departing for the United States, he stood as
an unsuccessful Liberal candidate in Blackpool. Wallace died on
February 10, 1932, en route to Hollywood to work on the screenplay for <i>King Kong</i>.
Although Wallace received a screen credit, he did no actual work on the
film. Ivy Wallace died fourteen months after her husband's death. King
Kong has been filmed three times. John Guillermin's remake from 1976
had a campy approach. The third version (2005), directed by Peter
Jackson, was more faithful to the original story. </p>

<blockquote><b><font size="2">Series character</font></b><font size="2">s: Among Wallace's characters are J.G. Reeder, T.B. Smith, Superintendent Minter, Sanders of
the Rivers, The Sooper, and Sergeant/Inspector Elk. J.G. Reeder is a little, middle-aged man, with 'criminal mind'. <b>"He wore half-way down his nose a pair of steel-rimmed pince-nez, through which nobody had ever seen him look </b></font><font size="2"><b>&#8211;</b></font><font size="2"><b>

plots everywhere, and most of them seem to be real. Reader has worked
at various times for Scotland Yard, Banker's Trust, and the public
prosecutor's office. Four British films of the 1920s were based on the
