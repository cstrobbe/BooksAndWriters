<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Great Russian novelist, dramatist, satirist, 
 founder of the so-called critical realism in Russian literature, best-known for his novel <em>Mertvye dushi</em>
I-II (1842, Dead Souls). Gogol's prose is characterized by imaginative
power and linguistic playfulness. As an exposer of grotesque in human
nature, Gogol could be called the Hieronymus Bosch of Russian
literature. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"The moon is made by some lame cooper,
and you can see the idiot has no idea about moons at all. He put in a
creosoted rope and some wood oil; and this has led to such a terrible
stink all over the earth that you have to hold your nose. Another
reason the moon is such a tender globe it that people just cannot live
on it any more, and all that's left alive there are noses. This is also
why we cannot see our own noses&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;they're all on the moon." </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Diary of a Madman, </font></i><font size="2">1835) </font></blockquote>


<p>Nikolai Gogol was born in Sorochintsi, Ukraine,&nbsp;where he&nbsp;grew up on his 
parents' country estate. His real surname was Ianovskii, but the writer's 
grandfather had taken the name 'Gogol' to claim a noble Cossack ancestry. 
Gogol's father&nbsp;was an educated and gifted man, who wrote plays, poems, and sketches in 
Ukrainian. </p>
<p>Gogol started write while in high school. He attended Poltava
boarding school (1819-21) and then Nezhin high school (1821-28), where
he produced plays for the student's theatre and acted in some
productions. However, he was not very highly esteemed by his school and
he found it difficult to open up to his schoolmates, who regarded him
as the "mysterious dwarf," a secretive individual. To his mother he
wrote: "At home I am considered willful; here I am called meek . . . in
some quarters I am so very quiet, modest, polite; in others&nbsp;&#8211;
sullen, pensive, uncouth . . . for some I am intelligent, for others I
am stupid" (March 1, 1828). </p><p>In
1828 Gogol, an aspiring writer, settled in St. Petersburg, with a
certificate attesting his right to "the rank of the 14th class". To
support himself, Gogol worked at minor governmental jobs and wrote
occasionally for periodicals. Although he was interested in literature,
he also dreamed of becoming an actor. However, the capital of Russia
did not welcome him with open arms and his early narrative poem, <i>Hans Küchelgarten </i>(1829), turned out to be a disaster. </p>
<p>Between the years 1831 and
1834 Gogol taught history at the Patriotic Institute and worked as a
private tutor. In 1831 he met Aleksandr Pushkin who greatly influenced
his choice of literary material, especially his "Dikinka tales", which
were based on Ukrainian folklore. Their friendship lasted until the
great poet's death. <i>Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka </i>from
1831-32, Gogol's breakthrough work, showed his skill in mixing
fantastic with macabre, and at the same saying something very essential
about the Russian character. </p>
<p>After failure as an assistant lecturer 
of world history at the University of St. Petersburg (1834-35), Gogol 
became a full-time writer. Under the title <i>Mirgorod </i>(1835)
Gogol published a new collection of stories, beginning with 'Old-World
Landowners', which described the decay of the old way of life. The book
also included the famous historical tale 'Taras Bulba', written
under&nbsp;the influence of <a href="wscott.htm">Walter Scott</a>. The
protagonist is a strong, heroic character, not very typical for the
author's later cavalcade of bureaucrats, lunatics, swindlers, and
humiliated losers. One hostile critic descibed his city dwellers as the
"scum of Petersburg". In his short stories, Gogol fully utilized the
Petersburg mythology, in which the city was treated "both as
'paradise', a utopian ideal city of the future, the embodiment of
Reason, and as the terrible masquerade of Antichrist." <font size="2">(Yuri Lotman in </font><i><font size="2">Universe of the Mind</font></i><font size="2">, 1990) </font>Gogol
was also the first to publish an extended literary comparison between
Moscow and Petersburg, concluding, "Russia needs Moscow; Petersburg
needs Russia." </p>
<p>"I am destined by the mysterious powers to walk hand in hand with my strange 
heroes," wrote Gogol once, "viewing life in all its immensity as it rushes past me, 
viewing it through laughter seen by the world and tears unseen and unknown by it."<i> 
St. Petersburg Stories</i> (1835) examined social relationships and disorders of mind; Gogol's influence 
can be seen among others in Dostoevsky's <i>Notes from Underground</i> (1864) 
and <i>The Crime and the Punishment </i>(1866). Gogolian tradition continued also among others in the stories of <a href="kafka.htm">Franz Kafka</a>. </p>
<p>'The Nose' from this period was about a man who loses his nose,
which tries to live its own life. Gogol himself had a long nose, but
the motifs in the story were borrowed from other writers. According to
V. Vinograd's study (1987), these kind of surrealistic images were
popular the 1820-1830s. It is still a puzzle: no key has been found to
explain, why Collegiate Assessor Kovalev's nose transforms into civil
servant and back into nose. The central plot circles around Kovalev's
quest to recapture his runaway organ &#8211; he has arrived in Moscow to
climb up the social ladder but without proper face it is impossible.
Without an arm or leg it is not unbearable, thinks Major, but without a
nose a man is, the devil knows what... In the outwardly crazy story
lurks a serious idea: what matters is not the person but one's rank. </p>
<p>In 'Nevsky Prospect' a talented artist falls in love with a tender
poetic beauty. She turns out to be a prostitute and the artist commits
suicide when his romantic illusions are shattered. 'The Diary of a
Madman' asked why is it that "all the best things in life, they all go
to the Equerries or the generals?" 'Shinel' (1842, The Overcoat), one
of Gogol's most famous short stories, contrasted humility and meekness
with the rudeness of the "important personage". The central character
is Akakii Akakievich, a lowly government clerk. When winter begins he
notices that his old over coat is beyond repairing. He manages to save
money for a new, luxurious over
coat. His colleagues at the office arrange a party for his acquisition.
But his happiness proves to be short-lived. On the way home he is
attacked by thieves and robbed of his coat. To recover his loss,
Akakievich asks help from an Important Person, a director of a
department with the rank of general. He treats harshly Akakievich, who
develops a fever, and&nbsp;dies of fright within three days. One night
when the Important Person is returning home, he is attacked by a ghost,
the late Akakii, who now steals his overcoat. The stealing of outer
garments continue, even though now the ghost is a big
man with a moustache and enormous fists.</p>
<p>Gogol published in 1836 several stories in 
<a href="puskin.htm">Pushkin</a>'s journal <i>Sovremennik</i>, and in the 
same year appeared his famous play, <i>The Inspector General</i>. It 
told a simple tale of a young civil servant, Khlestakov, who finds himself 
stranded in a small provincial town. By mistake, he is taken by the local 
officials to be a government inspector, who is visiting their province 
incognito. Khlestakov happily adapts to his new role and exploits the situation. 
His true identity is revealed but then arrives the real inspector. Gogol 
masterfully creates with a few words people, places, things, and lets them 
disappear in the flow of the story. Vladimir Nabokov wrote: "Who is that 
unfortunate bather, steadily and uncannily growing, adding weight, fattening 
himself on the marrow of a metaphor? We never shall know &#8211; but he almost managed to gain a footing." </p>

<p>Its first stage production was in St Petersburg, given in the
presence of the tsar. As he left his box after the première, The tsar
dropped the comment: "Hmm, what a play! Gets at everyone, and most of
all at me!" Gogol, who was always sensitive about reaction to his work,
fled Russia for Western Europe. He visited Germany, Switzerland, and
France, and settled then in Rome. He also made a pilgrimage to
Palestine in 1848, to pray for inspiration for the part II of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dead Souls</span>. He had burned the manuscript of part II for the first time in 1845. <br>
</p>
<p>In Rome Gogol wrote his major work, 
<i>The Dead Souls</i>. "The prophet finds no honor in his homeland," he
said. Gogol claimed that the story was suggested by Pushkin in a
conversation in 1835. Pushkin did not live to see its publication, but
on hearing the first chapters read, he exclaimed: "God, how sad our
Russia is!" </p><p>Wishing
to embrace the whole Russian society, Gogol regarded the first volume
merely as "a pale introduction to the great epic poem which is taking
shape in my mind and will finally solve the riddle of my existence".
The story depicted the adventures Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, who
arrives in a provincial town to buy '"dead souls," dead serfs. As a
character, he is the opposite of starving Akakii Akakievich. By selling
these 'souls,' Chichikov planned to make a huge profit.
He meets local landowners and departs the town in a hurry,
when rumors start spread about him. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the play<em> Zhenitba</em> (1842) nearly everybody lies and the
protagonist, Podgolesin, cannot make up his mind about marriage. He
hesitates, agrees, then withdraws his promise, the life is full of
cheating, but when people jeer at each other, they actually tell the
truth. Igrogi (The Gamblers), about professional card-sharps, was first
staged in 1843; Dmitri Shostakovich based his unfinished opera on the
comedy.</p>


<p>Except for a short visits to Russia in 1839-40 and 1841-42, Gogol
was abroad for twelve years. The first edition of Gogol's collected
works&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1842 and made him one of the most popular
Russian writers. Two years before his return, Gogol had published <i>Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends</i>
(1847), in which he upheld the autocratic tsarist regime and the
patriarchal Russian way of life. The book disappointed radicals who had seen Gogol's works as examples of social criticism.
"The peasant must not even <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span>
there exist other books besides the Bible," Gogol argued. The radical
critic <a href="belinsk.htm">Vissarion Belinsky</a> labelled him as the "apostle of ignorance"
and Sergei Askakov lamented that "the best that can be done is to call
him a madman." <br>
</p>
<p>During the last decade of his life, Gogol struggled to continue the
story and depict Chichikov's fall and redemption. Gogol's friends were
exhausted by his&nbsp; arrogance and unreliability. After returning
from Jerusalem to Russia he came under influence of a fanatical priest,
Father Konstantinovskii, who urged him to abandon literature and to
enter a monastery. Gogol burned sequels for <i>Dead Souls</i>, just 
10 days before he died on the verge of madness on the 4th of March 1852. A few chapters of part II have survived. <br>
</p>
      <p>Gogol died of self-enforced starvation. Various remedies were
employed to make him eat &#8211; spirits were poured over his head, hot
loaves applied to his person and leeches attached to his nose. Rumors
arise from time to time that Gogol was buried alive, a situation
familiar from the story 'The Premature Burial,' of the contemporary
writer <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a> (1809-1849). </p>
