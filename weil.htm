<p>French philosopher, activist, and religious searcher, whose death in
1943 was hastened by starvation. Weil published during her lifetime
only a few poems and articles. With her posthumous works&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> 16 volumes, edited by André A. Devaux and Florence de Lussy&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font>
Weil has earned a reputation as one of the most original thinkers of
her era. T.S. Eliot described her as "a woman of genius, of a kind of
genius akin to that of the saints." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What a country calls its vital economic
interests are not the things which enable its citizens to live, but the
things which enable it to make war. Gasoline is much more likely than
wheat to be a cause of international conflict."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Need for Roots</font></i><font size="2">, 1949) </font></blockquote>
<p>Simone Weil was born in Paris in her parents' apartment on the Rue
de Strasbourg. Later the family moved to a larger flat on the Boulevard
Saint-Michel. Simone was raised in an agnostic Jewish family. Her
father, Bernard Weil, was an Alsace physician and her mother (née
Salomea Reinherz), was Austro-Galician. Salomea&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> or Selma&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font>
came from a wealthy family of Jewish businessmen. She had wanted to
become a doctor but her father forbad it. For her own amazing children
she wanted the best education available. Weil's brother André solved
mathematical problems beyond the doctoral level at the age of twelve;
he became a distinguished mathematician. Selma Weil's solicitude had
also an excessive side&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> she had a
phobic dread of microbes and imposed on her children compulsive hand
washing. Mme Weil ruled, that outside the immediate family, nobody else
was allowed to kiss the children. Throughout her life, Simone avoided
most forms of physical contact. She also had problems with food. At the
age of six she refused to eat sugar, because it was not rationed to
French soldiers in the war. In the late 1930s, possibly due to her
malnutrition, she had mystical experiences. </p>
<p>In her early teens, Weil mastered Greek and several modern
languages. With André, she sometimes communicated in ancient Greek.
When after the Russian Revolution she was accused of being a Communist
by a classmate, she answered: "Not at all; I am a Bolshevik." Weil
studied at the Lycée Fénelon (1920-24) and Lycée Victor Duruy, Paris
(1924-25), graduating with baccalauréat. She then continued her studies
at the Lycée Henri IV (1925-28), where she was taught by the noted
French philosopher Alain, pseudonym of Emile Auguste Chartier
(1868-1951). He trained his students to think critically by assigning
them topoi, take-home essay examinations. In 1928, Weil finished first
in the entrance examination for the École Normale Supérieure; <a href="beauvoir.htm">Simone de Beauvoir</a>
finished second. During the following years Weil attracted much
attention with her&nbsp;uncompromising attitudes. Around the Left Bank
of Paris,&nbsp;the myopic and awkward&nbsp;Weil was called the "Red
Virgin." </p>
<p>In 1931 Weil received her <i>agrégation</i> in philosophy. Though
physically weak, she alternated stints of teaching philosophy with
manual labour in factories and fields, in order to understand the real
needs of the workers. She insisted that writing should be based on
experience. "The intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is
like the condemned man who is proud of his cell," she once said.
Between the years 1931 and 1938, she was employed by various schools in
Le Puy, Auxerre, Roanne, Bourges, and Saint-Quentin. "Whenever, in
life, one is actively involved in something, or one suffers violently,
one cannot think about oneself," Weil taught at the lycée for girls at
Roanne. </p>
<p>Weil did not associate with her teacher colleagues but preferred the
company of workers and sat with them in cafés. Her salary she shared
with the unemployed. After participating in a protest march, she was
forced to resign from Le Puy-en-Velay high school. In 1934-35 she was a
"hopelessly inept" factory worker for Renault, Alsthom, and Carnaud.
This hard period nearly crushed her emotionally and physically&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> she had abnormally small, feeble hands&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font>
as she confessed in her diary. In spite of her pacifist beliefs, she
served in 1936 briefly as a volunteer with the Republicans in the
Spanish Civil War. The novelist Georges Bataille described her as "a
Don Quixot". "'I knew her very well,' Trotsky wrote in a letter of July
30, 1936, to his comrade Victor Serge. 'I have had long discussions
with her. For a period of time she was more or less in sympathy with
our cause, but then she lost faith in the proletariat and in Marxism.
It's possible that she will turn toward the left again. But is it worth
the trouble to talk about this any longer?'" <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Left Hand of God </font></i><font size="2">by Adolf Holl, 1997)</font> Armed with a rifle but nearsighted, she was a danger to everyone around her, including herself. A
clumsy accident &#8211; she stuck her foot in a pot of boiling cooking oil
and suffered a severe burn &#8211; forced her to leave the front, and she
went to Portugal to recuperate. To the moral problem with which she had
wrestled secretly, would she try to kill the enemy, and in the process,
risk killing an innocent victim, she never found an answer. <font size="2"><br>
      </font></p>
<p>After witnessing the horrors of war in Spain, Weil revealed in her
journals her deepening disillusionment with ideologies. She saw that
Communism led to the formation of a State dictatorship. "From human
beings, no help can be expected," she wrote already in 1934. Sex was
something she was afraid of. Her pacifist stance she later considered a
mistake, saying: "If Mr. Gandhi can protect his sister from rape
through non-violent means, then I will be a pacifist." For a time she
felt attraction to Anarchism and Syndicalism and she worked for the
anarchist trade union movement La Révolution Prolétarianne. In the
mid-1930s Weil became increasingly drawn to Christianity. However, she
refused baptism into the Catholic Church. <br>
</p>
      <p>Upon returning to France, she obtained a teaching post at
Saint-Quentin. Headaches continued to plague her. In 1938 she converted
from Judaism to Christianity. Weil studied Greek poetry and Gregorian
music, and in 1937 at the chapel of St. Francis of Assisi, in Asssisi,
Italy, she had one of her mystical experiences. Occasionally she
dressed in the clothes of a poor monk or a soldier. In 1940 the Vichy
anti-Jewish laws required her dismissal from teaching. <br>
 </p>

<p>During the first years of World War II Weil lived with her parents
in Paris, Vichy, and Marseilles. She continued to write and worked at
Gustave Thibon's vineyards in Saint-Marcel d'Ardéche. Before leaving
France, she gave to Thibon her notebooks and other papers, which formed
the core of her posthumous works. In Marseilles she met Father
Joseph-Marie Perrin, with whom she had long discussions, but refused
finally his offer to baptize her into the Catholic faith. She fled from
Nazi occupation to the United States and then to England in 1942, where
she worked for the Ministry of the Interior in De Gaulle's Free French
movement in 1943. Weil died at the age of 34 of tuberculosis and
self-neglect in Ashford on August 24, 1943. She refused food and
medical treatment out of sympathy for the plight of the people of
Occupied France. This act hastened her death, although it is debated
whether her death was a result of actual suicide or mental illness.
Weil also believed that one must "decreate" oneself to return to God.</p>
<p>Weil's early essays were published in Alain's<i> Libre Propos</i>. From 1940 she contributed to <i>Les Cahiers du Sud</i>.
Weil's writings from her first period (1931-36) explore contemporary
problems. The later writings (1938-43) reflect her religious searching.
In <i>Gravity and Grace</i> (1947) she stated that "attachement is the
great fabricator of illusions; reality can be attained only by someone
who is detached." God, in creating the universe, effaced himself from
it and surrendered it to its own law of gravity, or necessity.
"Necessity is everywhere, and the good nowhere," she wrote. 'La
pesanteur' or gravity meant in Weil's text undeveloped, primitive
forces in human beings. Another force, in conflict with it, is God's
grace. "Two forces prevail in the universe: light and gravity." Weil's
political philosophy is best expressed in the <i>The Need for Roots </i>(1953).
The great problem of society is 'déracinement', its 'uprootedness'; its
cure is a social order grounded in a 'spiritual core' of physical
labor. One can find from work beauty, poetry and spiritual inspiration.
She wrote the book in 1943 at the request of the Free French
organization as a guide to the reconstruction of post-war France. In <i>Oppression and Liberty</i>
(1955) she is concerned with the nature and possibility of individual
freedom in various political and social systems, finally opting for
liberalism rather than socialism.</p>
