      <p>Russian-born poet who was awarded the Nobel Prize for
Literature in
1987. After moving to the United States Brodsky wrote his poems in
Russian and his prose works in English. As a poet Brodsky was largely
traditional and classical. He dealt with moral, religious and
historical themes, and often used mythological allusions.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The poet, I wish to repeat, is
language's means for existence--or, as my beloved Auden said, he is the
one by whom it lives. I who write these lines will cease to be; so will
you who read them. But the language in which they are written and in
which you read them will remain not merely because language is more
lasting than man, but because it is more capable of mutation."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Nobel Lecture</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Joseph Brodsky was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). His
father was a photographer, but the family lived mostly on his mother's
income. Brodsky studied at schools in Leningrad to the age of 15. He
then dropped out of school and first went to work at the Arsenal
defense plant. Between 1956 and 1962, he had some thirteen different
jobs.</p>
      <p>In the essay 'Less Than One' Brodsky tells that he began to
despise
Lenin already when he was in the first grade &#8211; "not so much because of
his political philosophy or practice, about which at the age of seven I
knew very little, but because of his omnipresent images which plagued
almost every textbook, every class wall, postage stamps, money, and
what not, depicting the man at various ages and stages of his life."
Everyone in his class knew that he was a Jew, but "seven-year-old boys
don't make good anti-Semites," he later said. From the library of his
uncle, who was a member of the Party, Brodsky found an illustrated,
pre-revolutionary edition of <i>Man and Woman</i>, his first taste of
the forbidden fruit. At the age of fourteen Brodsky applied for
admission to a submarine academy, but because he was a Jew, he did not
get in. </p>
      <p>After Nikita Khrushchev speech at the 20th Party Congress of
1956,
in which he unmasked the cult of personality and condemned the
Stalinist encesses, a period of "thaw" occurred in the Soviet Union.
Although after the Cuban missile crisis Khrushchev tried to close
dissident voices, new ideas managed to emerge in literature and other
cultural fields. Brodsky started to write poetry from the late 1950s,
earning a reputation as a free thinking writer. He taught himself
Polish so that he could read poetry that had never been translated into
Russian. Brodsky also demonstrated considerable talent in rendering
Russian translations of Donne and Marvell, and he read such Western
authors as Kafka, Proust, and Faulkner through Polish translations. In
the 1960s, he also translated 'Yellow Submarine' by The Beatles into
Russian.</p>
      <p>As a young man, Brodsky worked at many occupations, including
a
milling machine operator, stoker, and geologist-prospector. His output
as a freelance poet and self-taught translator did not gain the
approval of the authorities, although he never directly criticized the
government.&nbsp; Some of his love poems were devoted to Marina
Basmanova, a painter.&nbsp;All of his&nbsp;writings appeared in
samizdat (clandestine circulation) editions but was widely read.
Brodsky's reputation made him a target for the secret police and he was
convicted as a "social parasite". When the judge asked, "And who
recognized that you are a poet? Who listed you among poets?" the poet
replied according to Frida Vigdorova, a journalist, "No one.
(Dispassionately.) Who listed me a member of the human race?" Brodsky
was sent to a mental institution, where he was wrapped in cold, wet
sheets, a "cure" familiar from Jaroslav Ha&#353;ek's <i>The Good Soldier
Schweik</i>. </p>
      <p>Among those, who rose to Brodsky's defense and called the
trial
illegal, was the composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Brodsky spent some time
in Kresty, the most famous prison in the Soviet Union. In the official
record he was characterized to be "less than one". It became the title
for Brodsky's collection of essays, which was published in 1986.
Brodsky was sentenced to five years of hard labour. He spent eighteen
months in the village of Norenskaya, three hundren and fifty
miles&nbsp;from Leningrad.&nbsp;While in exile, he was vivited by his
mother and his friends, including the poet Dmitry Bobyshev, who stole
his girlfriend, Marina. Brodsky's sentence was commuted in 1965 after
protests by such prominent cultural figures as the French philosopher
Jean-Paul Sartre and the poet Anna Akhmatova, the anti-Stalinist icon,
who was his close friend. They first met in 1961 at her dacha in
Komarovo. </p>
      <p>During Brodsky's time in prison a collection of his poems, <span class="st"><em>Stikhotvoreniya i poemy</em></span>,
was issued in 1965 by an American publisher in New York. "I had a
sensation of something completely ridiculous having happened", Brodsky
said later. Also <em>Ostanocka v pustyne</em> (1970) was published
abroad. In it Brodsky turned his back on the clichés of the socialist
realism and drew on the literary tradition on his search for search for
new poetic possibilities.</p>
      <p>After reading a poem by Brodsky, Akhmatova wrote in her diary:
"Either I know nothing at all or this is genius." Officials declared
that Brodsky had "produced a body the system found alien enough to
reject". In 1972 Brodsky was forced to exile from the USSR. He never
saw his parents, and he was separated from his his four-year-old son,
Andrei, whose mother was the artist Marianna Basmanova. His love poems,
dedicated to her, Brodsky collected in <em>Novyje Stansy k Avguste</em>
(1983). In 1990 Brodsky married in the Stockholm City Hall Maria
Sozzani, his student, whom he had met in France.</p>
      <p>With his suitcase, made in China, Brodsky first first went to
Vienna. The poet W. H. Auden and Carl Proffer, a professor of Slavic
languages at the University of Michigan, who had met Brodsky in
Leningrad, helped him to emigrate to the United States. Proffer's
publishing house Ardis several volumes of Brodsky's verse. He worked as
a visiting professor at several universities, including the University
of Michigan, Queen College, City University of New York, Columbia
University, New York University, Smith College, Amherst College,
Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College.</p>
      <p>While in exile, Brodsky traveled extensively. In 1972, he
visited Venice for the first time. He returned there again and again
and recorded his impressions of those trips in <span style="font-style: italic;">Watermark</span>
(1992). The American writer <a href="sontag.htm">Susan Sontag</a> once remarked that Venice was
ideal place to bury Brodsky, since it was essentially nowhere. They had
met 1977 and went together to meet <a href="epound.htm">Ezra Pound</a>'s
widow Olga Rudge. Brodsky had translated his poems into Russian as a young man. "The
translations were trash, but came very close to being published," he
recalled. Olga claimed that her husband wasn't an anti-Semite: "How
could he be an anti-Semite? He had a Hebrew name." <font size="-1">(Susan
Sontag, in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Brodsky Through the Eyes
of His Contemporaries</span> by Valentina Polukhina, 1992) </font>Brodsky's
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Watermark</span> has inspired
the film <span style="font-style: italic;">Veden peili </span>(2012)
by the Finnish writer and photographer Rax Rinnekangas. <br>
      </p>
      <p>For many years, Brodsky rented an apartment on Morton Street,
in New York City. With his Nobel Prize money, he renovated the
apartment. After the repairs were finished, his landlord needed it for
himself and his wife, a Finnish doctor. However, Brodsky liked New
York: "... for very well balanced people, it's probably a bad place but
for masochists like me, it's OK." In 1977 Brodsky became a U.S. citizen
and in 1991-92 he was America's Poet Laureate. He was a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Letters, but resigned in protest over the
honorary membership of the Russian poet <a href="jevtusen.htm">Evgenii
Evtushenko</a> in 1987 &#8211; he considered Evtushenko a party yes-man. </p>
      <p>Brodsky died of a heart attack on January 28, 1996, in New
York.
Brodsky's parents were not allowed to travel to the West to see him and
they died in Leningrad. In his essays about his parents in <i>Less
Than One</i>
(1986) the author explained: ''I write this in English because I want
to grant them a margin of freedom: the margin whose width depends on
the number of those who may be willing to read this. I want Maria
Volpert and Alexander Brodsky to acquire reality under 'a foreign code
of conscience,' I want English verbs of motion to describe their
movements. This won't resurrect them, but English grammar may at least
prove to be a better escape route from the chimneys of the state
crematorium than the Russian.'' </p>
      <p>Like several dissident Russian poets, Brodsky intended his
verse for
recital rather than for silent reading. Existential problems are dealt
in such poems as 'Isaak i Avraam' (1963), which was based on the Old
Testament story, and 'Gorbunov i Gorchakov' (1965-68), in which Brodsky
fills a madhouse conversation of two patients with references to
literature and history. Later works reflected the poet's idea of the
coming of a post-Christian era, during which the antagonism between
good and evil is replaced by moral ambiguity. Other favorite themes
were loss, suffering, exile, and old age. In his new home country
Brodsky did not feel complete secure &#8211; disturbing visions penetrated
into his mind even in peaceful Cape Cod: "in formal opposition, near
and far, / lined up like print in a book about to close, / armies
rehearsed their games in balanced rows / and cities all went dark as
caviar." <font size="2">(in<i> Lullaby of Cape Cod</i>, 1975) </font>He
also recognized in the work of Robert Frost tones darker than his image
as the "folksy, crusty, wisecracking old gentleman farmer" would
suggest.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Still, if sins are forgiven, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">that is, if souls break even </font><br>
        <font size="2">with flesh elsewhere, this joint, </font><br>
        <font size="2">too, must be enjoyed</font><br>
        <font size="2">as afterlife's sweet parlor </font><br>
        <font size="2">where, in the clouded squalor, </font><br>
        <font size="2">saints and the ain'ts take five, </font><br>
        <font size="2">where I was first to arrive." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'Cafe Trieste: San Franciso', to L.G.) </font></blockquote>
      <p>As an essayist Brodsky started in the 1970s, writing first in
Russian. He soon switched to English, but never fully mastered the
language. Brodsky became a regular contributor to the <i>New York
Review of Books</i>, <i>Partisan Review</i>, and <i>The Times
Literary Supplement</i>.
He wrote mostly about literature, evaluating Auden as "the greatest
mind of the twentieth century" and Osip Mandelshtam "a poet of and for
civilization". Language was for him a vehicle of civilization, superior
to history, living longer than any state. Poems are a vehicle to
restructure time &#8211; poets should keep language alive ''in the light of
conscience and culture.'' <br>
      </p>
      <p>Brodsky finished in his lifetime two collections of essays. <i>Less
Than One </i>explored the works of Marina Tsvetayeva, Anna Akhmatova,
Mandelshtam, Auden, Derek Walcott, C.P. Cavafy, and Eugenio Montale. <i>On
Grief and Reason</i>
(1995) includes tributes to his favorite poets Frost, Hardy, and Rainer
Maria Rilke. In one essay Brodsky claimed that after the Great
Patriotic War theatres showed Hollywood films &#8211; war booty from Germany
&#8211; and that Tarzan films influenced the dissolving of the Stalin cult
more than Nikita Khrushchev's speeches. </p>
