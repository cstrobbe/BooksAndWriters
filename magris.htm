<p>Italian novelist, essayist, and cultural philosopher, professor of
German literature, whose internationally acclaimed works include <i>Danube</i> (1986) and <i>Microcosms</i>
(1997), both freely through time and space flowing cultural
travelogues, or journeys of the imagination. Magris has been mentioned
as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Tolerance is a particularly important
and difficult value for those who, like me, were born and grew up in a
borderland such as Trieste is, at the crossroads between the Italian,
Slav and German worlds. The border can be a stimulant or an obsession,
an opportunity or a curse, a place where it is easier to know and love
the other or easier to hate and reject him; a place to make contact or
to exercise intolerance.</b></font><b><font size="2">"</font></b><font size="2"> (from '</font><font size="2">The Fair of Tolerance', 2001)</font></blockquote>
<p>Claudio Magris was born in 1939 in Trieste, a cosmopolitan port
city, ruled by the Habsburgs for centuries until it was ceded to Italy.
His mother, who came from Dalmatia, was of Greek-Venetian heritage.
Magris's paternal grandfather moved to Trieste from the historical
region of Friuli. Magris was educated at the Universita degli Studi di
Torino, in Turin, receiving his degree in 1962. After studies in German
universities, he taught at the University of Trieste and at the
University of Turin. His dissertation, <i>Il mito asburgico nella letteratura austriaca moderna </i>(1963), 
about the Habsburg myth in modern Austrian literature, Magris finished at the age of 24.  
From 1978 Magris worked as Professor of German Literature at the University of Trieste. 
From 1994 to 1996 he was a member of the Senate in the XIIth legislature of the Republic 
of Italy.  In 2001 he was appointed to a Chair at the Collège de France. In 2009 
Magris became Writer-in-Residence at Utrecht University and taught there a series of master classes.</p>

<p>Magris has also translated into Italy works by Ibsen, Kleist,
Schnitzler, Büchner and Grillparzer, and written essays and critical
studies on such writers as Borges, Wilhelm Heinse, E.T.A. Hoffmann,
Ibsen, Kafka, Musil, Rilke, and Joseph Roth. Magris's work have
appeared in several European newspapers and magazines, including <i>Corriere della Sera</i>,  Italy's leading national daily. </p>
<p>Magris's first novel was <i>Inferences on a Sabre</i> (1984), about
a battalion of Cossac fighters, who collaborated with the Nazis in
northeastern Italy during World War II. His other prose works and works
for the theatre include the novels<i> Un altro mare </i>(1991) and <i>Alla cieca</i> (2005), and the plays <i>Stadelmann</i> (1988),  <i>Le Voci</i> (1999), and <i>La mostra</i> (2001). <i>Lei dunque capirà</i>
(2006) was a story about modern day Orpheus and Eurydice, progressesing
with the logic of dreams and myths. Magris's essays from 1974 to 1998,
dealing mostly central and eastern European themes, were published in <i>Utopia e disincanto</i>. </p>
<p>Magris's enormously erudite writings, insightful and full of
details, continues the tradition of the Italian philosopher of spirit, <a href="croce.htm">Benedetto Croce</a>
(1866-1952); his style, lively, self-indulgent, and occasionally
ironic, links him to such cultural historians of the 19th and 20th
centuries as Jacob Burckhardt and Egon Friedell. "Writing is
transcribing," Magris has once said. "Even when an author invents, he
transcribes stories and events that life has made him a participant in:
without certain faces, certain major and minor events, certain
important people, certain bright moments, certain periods of gloom,
certain landscapes, certain moments of happiness and despair, many
pages would not have been created." </p>
<p>In<i> Danube</i>, in which the river is the guide to the geography,
history and culture of Europe from the eastern slopes of the Black
Forest to the Black Sea, Magris renews the traditional travelogue, and
transforms it into an intellectual treasure-trove filled with fables,
literary anecdotes, fantasy, intriguing and eccentric characters and
whimsical observations. "Mr. Magris's Danube carries few embarkations,
least of all the author's," said Eugen Weber in <i>The New York Times</i> <font size="2">(October 1, 1989)</font>.
"It beckons him instead from place to place, the means of transport
being left in doubt - perhaps a flight of fancy." Magris's image of
Europe is basically borderless; its cultures are in a constant dialogue
with the past and present. The book won the Chianti Rufino-Antico
Fattore International Award and has been translated into some 30
languages. </p>
<p>In the center of the <i>Microcosms</i> is the Cafe San Marco, where
Magris himself has done much of his writing. His own portrait is also
on one of the café's walls. Magris describes the cafe as "Noah's Arch"
and a "suburb of history". The impressionistic journey into landscapes,
culture, and people of northern Italy received the prestigious Strega
Prize in 1997. </p>
<p>Magris has been honored with many awards. In 2001 Magris was awarded
the Erasmus Prize and the Leipzig Book Award. He received the gold
medal from Madrid's Círculo de Bellas Artes in 2003 and the 2004 Prince
of Asturias Prize for his contribution to Literature. In 2005 he was
received the Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Literary Prize and in 2009 he
was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. Magris also holds
doctorates honoris causa at several universities. In 1964, Magris
married Marisa Madieri, a writer, too; she died in 1996. </p>
