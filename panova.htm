      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Soviet writer and journalist, who
followed
in her works socialist realism quite faithfully, and empasized kindness
and sympathy between people. Vera Panova won three State Prizes and her
book were published in more than 50 languages. Several of her best
stories were devoted to children and explored the problems of moral
upbringing. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"While you're still a kid, you
can't imagine what a man's life is like. You think when your Dad's done
his seven or eight hours he's finished for the day. Apart from a bit of
voluntary work he may have to do, of course, or a meeting. But when you
begin to grow up and go on your own, to the left and right of the gate,
the you see what a mass of different things men have to occupy their
time. Take the motor cyclists, for instance, taking their driving tests
every day in Stable Square. There's the examiner, a lieutenant of the
militia, watching someone doing figures of eight on his motorbike. And
there's a a regular crowd of men, young and old, standing round. Rooted
to the spot they are, won't move an inch. Just stand there looking on,
criticizing."</b> (in 'The Boys at the Cafe', </font><i><font size="2">An
Anthology of Soviet Short Stories</font></i><font size="2">, translated
by Robert Daglish, 1976) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Vera Panova was born in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia. Her
father, who was a bank clerk, drowned
in a boating accident when she was only six years old. Panova's mother
worked as a bookkeeper. When still a child, Panova was forced to go to
work in a laundry and she could not continue her education at the
gymnasium school. </p>
      <p>Panova had started to write poetry and prose at early age, and
in 1922 she joined the staff of a small local newspaper, <i>Trudovoi
Don</i>. She also worked as a correspondent for other newspapers,
writing mostly book reviews, and on publications for children. Under
the pseudonym "Vera Veltman" she published humorous pieces and
sketches. </p>
      <p>In 1937 Panova left Rostov with her family and settled in
Ukraine. In 1933 she began to write plays, but, by her own admission,
did not succeed well. Her first play,<i> </i><i>Vesna</i>, was
produced by B. Fatilevich in the Theater of Drama of Rostov-on-the-Don.
      <i>Il'ia Kosogor</i> (1939) showed the influence of Gorky. By the
beginning of World War II, she lived in the town of Pushkin. When the
town fell to the Nazis, she was due to be deported to a German
concentration camp. However, she managed to escape and returned to
Ukraine.</p>
      <p>After the liberation of Ukraine, she moved to the city of Perm
in the Urals where she worked for local newspaper and radio. Panova'
play,<i> Devochi </i>(1945), won a Committee on the Arts award as the
best play for young people on a contemporary theme. </p>
      <p>During the war years
Panova began writing the factory novel <i>Kruzhilikha</i> (1947), set
in a factory town in the Urals. Often her characters were not only good
or bad citizens, and in the portrayal of Listopad, an egocentric, she
showed her skills in created a likeable "negative hero". In 1944 she
was
invited to travel from Perm on board a hospital train. Her journey
formed
the basis for the popular novel <i>Sputniki </i>(1946, The Train),
which won a Stalin Prize. Later on it was adapted into screen under the
title <i>The
Charity Train</i> and in 1975 it was turned into a four-part television
film.
The plotless story, written as a direct assignment from the Union of
Soviet Writers, was composed of series of episodes, and depicted human
relationships and suffering under war conditions. </p>
      <p>Despite criticism she won a second prize for <i>Kruzhilikha</i>,
and her third Stalin Prize was awarded for <i>Yasny bereg</i> (1949).
From the early 1950 Panova wrote regularly for the journal <i>Novyi mir</i>.
      <i>Sentimentalnyi Roman</i> (1958) was largely autobiographical
work and reflected some of her experiences as a young reporter. This
story was adapted to screen by Igor Maslennikov in the 1970s.<i> Serezha</i>
(1955, Time Walked / A Summer to Remember) marked the beginning of a
new cycle of stories about children. It was a psychological novella,
seen through the eyes of a small boy, whose life changes when his
widowed mother marries a collective farm director, a kind and
understanding man. <i>Serezha</i> was turned into a film in 1960,
which received
the main prize at the 12th Internatinal Film Festival in Karlovy Vary. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Panova was essentially a Party
writer, whose books were considered (on the whole) ideologically sound.
Against a generally mediocre socialist realist background, however, she
was noted for her vivid descriptions of real-life situations.
Furthermore, the reader could identify with her characters who were not
portrayed in purely black-and-white terms as either heroes or
villains... Her style was warm and vivid and, for an ordinary Soviet
reader brought up on stodgy ideologically sound prose, her books
represented in comparative terms a "good read"."</b>(Anna Pilkington in
        </font><font size="2"><i>Reference Guide to Russian Literature</i>,
ed. Neil Cornwell, 1998)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Panova managed find room for her literary creativity and her
liberal views under the pressure of the censorship and the constraints
of Socialist Realism. Though she wrote about women's lives, her
perspective was not strictly feminist; the term "woman writer" had in
Soviet society negative connotations dating from prerevolutionary
times. Focus on domestic issues and the private sphere without
ideological content was regarded as a serious drawback by censors and
critics. Panova's later works include <i>Vremena goda</i> (1954),
which was attacked at the Leningrad Writers Conference and in the
press. Vsevolod Kochetov, a minor novelist, criticized Panova's work
for its "naturalism" and lack of "Party spirit". "Naturalism can
entertain, astound, arouse emotion, but it cannot make profound and
true social and artistic generalizations," said Kochetov in <i>Pravda</i>.
The story depicted everyday life in the Soviet Union. Dorofeya, an
ambitious party official, whose son Gennadi gets involved with
hooligans. Another central character is Bortashevich, a top-level
Communist bureaucrat and a scoundrel. Panova boldly implied a parallel
between criminal elements and corruption: Gennadi and Bortashevich are
victims of social their social and personal circumstances. The book was
an immediated success with the reading public and was also well
received in England and the United States. It is considered the first
novel that signaled the "thaw", of hopes change in the Stalinist
cultural policy, but it was <a href="eburg">Ilya Ehrenburg</a>'s
novelette <i>The Thaw</i> that gave its name to the &#8220;de-Stalinization&#8221;
era of the late 50's. </p>
      <p>A Leningrad writer Kiril Koscinski characterized Panova as
straightforward and sharp in her evaluation of the authorities. On the
other hand, she participated with a number of other decent writers in
the campaing against <a href="pasterna">Boris Pasternak</a>, regarding
the publication of <i>Doctor Zhivago</i> abroad as a provocation
against the Soviet intelligentsia. In the 1960s Panova travelled in the
United States as a part of
a delegation of Soviet authors and described her impressions in <i>From
My American Encounter</i>. Panova also published plays, film scenarios,
memoirs <i>O Moei Zhizni, Knigakh i Chitateliakh </i>(1975), and some
historical novellas about Russian princes and saints. In 1967 she
suffered a serious stroke. Vera Panova died in Leningrad on March 3,
1973. She was married three times: Arsenii Starosel'skii (1925,
divorced in 1927), Boris Vakhtin (separated), David Iakovlevich (from
1945). </p>
