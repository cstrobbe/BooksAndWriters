<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->British writer, famous for his ingenious
short stories and macabre children's books. Dahl's taste for cruelty,
rudeness to adults, and the comic grotesque fascinated young readers,
but upset many adult critics. Several of Dahl's stories have been made
into films, including <i>Matilda</i>, dir. by Danny DeVito (1996). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'Aunt Glosspan,' the boy said, ' what do ordinary people eat that we don't?' </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">'Animals,' she answered, tossing her head in disgust. </font><br>
<font size="2">'You mean live animals?' </font><br>
<font size="2">'No,' she said. 'Dead ones.' </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Pig' in </font><i><font size="2">Kiss, Kiss</font></i><font size="2">, 1959) </font></blockquote>
<p>Roald Dahl was born in Llandaff, Wales, of Norwegian parents. His
father, Harald Dahl, was the joint owner of a successful ship-broking
business, "Aadnesen&amp; Dahl" with another Norwegian. Before
emigrating to Wales, Harald had been a farmer near Oslo. He married a
young French girl named Marie in Paris; she died after giving birth to
their second child. In 1911 he married Sofie Magdalene Hesselberg.
Harald died when Dahl was four years old, and three weeks later his
elder sister, Astri, died from appendicitis. The family had to sell
their jewellery to pay for Dahl's upkeep at a private school in
Derbyshire. When Dahl was 13 he went to a public school named Repton.</p>
<p>His years at public schools in Wales and England Dahl later
described without nostalgia: "I was appalled by the fact that masters
and senior boys were allowed literally to wound other boys, and
sometimes quite severely. I couldn't get over it. I never got over
it..." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Boy: Tales of Childhood</font></i><font size="2">, 1984)</font>
Dahl especially hated the matron who ruled the school dormitories.
These experiences later inspired him to write stories in which children
fight against cruel adults and authorities. "I have never met anybody
who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is
intended," one of Dahl's English teachers commented.</p>
<p>"Parents and schoolteachers are the enemy," Dahl once said. "The
adult is the enemy of the child because of the awful process of
civilizing this thing that when it is born is an animal with no
manners, no moral sense at all." In Witches (1973) behind the mask of a
beautiful woman is an ugly witch, and in Matilda (1988) Miss Turnbull
throws children out of windows. Both parents are eaten in <span style="font-style: italic;">James and the Giant Peach</span>&nbsp; (1961), but the real enemies of the hero of the story, a little boy, are two aunts. </p>
<p>At eighteen, instead of entering university, Dahl joined an
expedition to Newfoundland. Returning to England he took a job with
Shell, working in London (1933-37) and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
(1937-39). During World War II he served in the Royal Air Forces in
Libya, Greece, and Syria. He was shot down in Libya, wounded in Syria,
and then posted to Washington as an assistant air attaché to British
Security (1942-43). In 1943 he was a wing commander and worked until
1945 for British Security Co-ordination in North America. </p>
<p>In the crash Dahl had fractured his skull, and said later: "You do get bits of magic from enormous 
bumps on the head." While he was recovering from his wounds, Dahl had strange dreams, which inspired his 
first short stories. Encouraged by <a href="forester.htm">C.S. Forester</a>, Dahl wrote about his most 
exiting RAF adventures. The story, <i>A Piece of Cake</i>, was published by the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>. 
It earned him $1,000. The same story was later included in <span style="font-style: italic;">Over To You: Ten Stories of Flyers and Flying</span> 
(1946). Dahl's first children's book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gremlins</span> (1943), about mischievous 
little creatures, who eventually join the Allied forces in the Battle of Britain, caught also Walt Disney's attention.  
Later it inspired a popular movie. 
Dahl's collection of short stories, <span style="font-style: italic;">Someone Like You</span> (1954), gained world success, as did its sequel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Kiss Kiss</span> (1959). The two books were serialized for television in America. A number of the stories had appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i>. Dahl's stories were seen in <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> (1955-61) and in the<i> Tales of the Unexpected</i> (1979) series.</p>


<p>In 1953 Dahl married the successful and wealthy actress Patricia
Neal; they had one son and four daughters &#8211; the eldest daughter Olivia
died of measles when she was eight. Dahl's wife suffered a series of
brain hemorrhages at the age of 38; while pregnant with their fifth
child she had a stroke. She described her recovery and her husband's
solicitous help in the autobiography <i>As I Am </i>(1988). The marriage ended
after other family tragedies; she also discovered that Dahl had been
having an affair with her friend, Felicity Ann Crossland, who was 22
years his junior. Dahl married her in 1983. Patricia Neal received in
1964 an Oscar for her performance in <i>Hud</i>. She died in 
2010. </p>
<p>The only stageplay Dahl ever wrote, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Honeys</span>, failed in New York in 1955. After showing little inclination towards children's literature, Dahl published <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>. The book came out first in the United States, but it took six years before Dahl found a published in Britain. <i>James and the Giant Peach</i> was followed by the highly popular tale <span style="font-style: italic;">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</span>
(1964), which has inspired two film adaptations. The story dealt with
one small boy's search for the ultimate prize in fierce competition
with other, highly unpleasant children, many of whom come to sticky
ends as a result of their greediness. It presented the central theme in
Dahl's fiction for young readers: virtue is rewarded, vice is punished.
In the end the fabulous chocolate factory is given to Charlie, the
kind, impoverished boy. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Witches</span>
(1983) won the Whitbread Children's Book Award in 1983. The judges
described the book as "deliciously disgusting". Later Felicity Dahl
collected her husband's culinary "delights", such as "Bird Pie", "Hot
Frogs", and "Lickable Wallpaper" in <i>Roald Dahl's Revolting Recipes </i>(1994). </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">My Uncle Oswald</span> (1979) was
Dahl's first full-length novel, a bizarre story of a scheme for
procuring and selling the sperm of the world's most powerful and
brilliant men. Dahl received three Edgar Allan Poe Awards (1954, 1959,
1980). In 1982 he won his first literary prize with<span style="font-style: italic;"> The BFG</span>,
a story about Big Friendly Giant, who kidnaps and takes a little girl
to Giantland, where giants eat children. In 1983 he received World
Fantasy Convention Lifetime Achievement award. Dahl died of an
infection on November 23, 1990, in Oxford. Dahl's autobiographical
books, <span style="font-style: italic;">Boy: Tales of Childhood</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Going Solo</span>,
came out in 1984 and 1986 respectively. The success of his books
resulted in the foundation of the Roald Dahl Children's Gallery in
Aylesbury, not far from where he lived. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Good ghost stories, like good children's
books, are damnably difficult to write. I am a short story writer
myself, and although I have been doing it for forty-five years and have
always longed to write just one decent ghost story, I have never
succeeded in bringing it off. Heaven knows, I have tried. Once I
thought I had done it. It was with a story that is now called 'The
Landlady'. But when it was finished and I examined it carefully, I knew
it wasn't good enough. I hadn't brought it off. I simply hadn't got the
secret. So finally I altered the ending and made it into a non-ghost
story."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories</font></i><font size="2">, 1983) </font></blockquote>
<p>Dahl's stories have unexpected endings and strange, menacing
atmospheres. The principle of "fair play" works in unconventional but
unavoidable ways. Uncle Oswald, a seducer from 'The Visitor', gets
seduced. In 'Parson's Pleasure' an antique dealer tastes his own
medicine and the Twits from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Twits</span>
(1980) use glue to catch birds and meet their own gluey ends. In 'Lamb
to the Slaughter' the evidence of a murder, a frozen leg of lamb, is
eaten by officers who in vain search for the murder weapon. The story
was inspired by a meeting with the writer <a href="ifleming.htm">Ian Fleming</a>
at a dinner party. Puns, word coinages, and neologism are more often
used in the children's stories, whereas in adult fiction the emphasis
is on imaginative plots. In addition to his children's books, Dahl also
aroused much controversy with his politically incorrect opinions - he
was accused of anti-Semitism and antifeminism and when a prowler
managed to get into Queen Elizabeth's bedroom, Dahl was wrongly
suspected of giving to the unwanted guest the whole idea in one of his
books, <i>The BFG</i> (1982). </p>
