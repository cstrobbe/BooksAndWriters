<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French poet and leader of the Symbolist movement in poetry with <a href="verlaine.htm">Paul Verlaine</a>.
Mallarmé was a provincial school teacher who came to Paris to live a
bourgeois life on the rue de Rome, but published allusive, compressed
poems, which suggested rather than denoted. He saw that his purified
language gives "a purer meaning to the words of the tribe." (from the
sonnet on Edgar Allan Poe) Mallarmé never gained wide recognition for
his work during his lifetime.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>O rêveuse, pour que je plonge </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Au pur délice sans chemin, </font><br>
<font size="2">Sache, par un subtil mensonge </font><br>
<font size="2">Garder mon aile dans ta main. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Eventail de Mademoiselle Mallarmé')</font></blockquote>
<p>Stéphane Mallarmé was born in Paris into a family in which his father 
and grandfather had made a noteworthy career in the French civil service. He was 
expected to follow the family tradition but at school he did not do well except 
in languages. Mallarmé began writing poetry at an early age under the 
influence of Victor Hugo. At the age of nineteen he found 
<a href="baudelai.htm">Charles Baudelaire</a>'s <i>The Flowers of Evil</i>,
which had appeared in 1857. Under its influence he wrote 'Briese
marine,' starting with the much quoted line "Le chair est triste,
hélas! et j'ai lu tous les livres". After leaving school he visited
England and while in London he married Marie Gerhard. Mallarmé taught
English from 1864 in Tournon, Besançon, Avignon, and Paris until his
retirement in 1893. The solitary years in Tournon and&nbsp;Besançon
were his years of apprenticeship, during which he prepared himself for
his career as a man of letters. </p><p>Mallarmé's&nbsp;poems started to appear in magazines in the 1860s. His first important poem, 'L'Azur', was published when he 
was 24. All his life he spent a very long time on each of his poems, 
making them as perfect as possible. <span class="st"><span class="ft">In between writing, he suffered from bouts of physical illness and metaphysical anguish</span></span>. Claude Debussy had set Mallarmé's poem 
'Apparation' to music in 1882, but their first meeting 
took place years later.. <em>L'Après-Midi d'un faune</em> 
(1865-67; published in 1876), best-known work, inspired Debussy's 
tone poem (1894) of the same name and was illustrated by the 
famous painter Manet. <br>
</p>
      <p>Originally Debussy had planned to write a three-part
composition on the poem, but only completed the 'Prelude.' The great
Russian-born ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky made it the score for his
ballet choreography, which was performed in 1912. Nijinsky played the
role of the faun. Against all expectations, he made only one leap. At
the end, the faun thrusts his body into a scarf the most beautiful
nymph has left behind. This sexual act shocked the premiere audience,
but the producer Serghei Diaghilev commissioned a repeat performance
and it was danced again. When the national newspaper<span style="font-style: italic;"> Le Figaro</span> launched a campaign against the ballet, Auguste Renoir and Odilon Redon rushed to the dancer's defence. Diaghilev was delighted. <br>
      </p>
      <p>From time to time Debussy attended 
Mallermé's Tuesday evening gatherings, which attracted 
such writers, artists, musicians, and intellectuals as 
André Gide, Paul Valéry and Oscar Wilde, the painters 
Renoir, Monet, Degas, Redon, and Whistler, and the 
sculptor Rodin. "Certainly Mallarmé prepared his 
conversations," recalled Gide later, "but he spoke 
with such art and in a tone that had so little of the 
doctrinal about it that it seemed as if he had just that 
instant invented each new proposition". 
      </p>
<p><i>The Afternoon of the Faun</i> presents the wandering thoughts 
of a faun on a drowsy summer afternoon. "Forgetful let me 
lie where summer's drouth / Sifts fine the sand and then with gaping 
mouth / Dream planet-struck by the grape's round wine-red star. / 
Nymphs, I shall see the shade that now you are." 
<font size="2">(translated by Aldous Huxley)</font> Mallarmé began 
to write the poems while working in Tournon, a town he 
found ugly and unpleasant. For Claude Debussy he wrote 
in December 1894 after coming from the concert: 
"... what a marvel! your illustration of the 
Afternoon of a Faun &#8211; not in the slightest disaccord with 
my text, except that it goes further, truly, in nostalgia and 
light, so delicate, disquieting, and rich." </p>
<p>Between the years 1867 and 1873 Mallarmé did not 
finish any of his large poetical works,&nbsp;<em>Hérodiade</em> (1869) 
included. Among Mallarmé's later publications are<em> Toast funèbre</em>, 
which was written in memory of the author Théophile Gautier, 
and the experimental poem, one of his masterpieces, 'Un Coup De Dés' 
(1914, A Throw of the Dice), which was published posthumously. </p>
<p>From the 1880s Mallarmé was the center of a group of French 
writers in Paris, which had such members Gide, Paul Valéry, and 
Proust. Mallarmé's ideas on poetry and art were considered difficult 
and obscure. When Mallarmé started to write poetry in the 1850s', 
French poets were still rather obedient to certain conventions concerning 
rhyme, metre, theme, etc. Victor's Hugo's notion that 'pure poetry' is 
essentially 'useless' was widely accepted. Proust wrote once: "How 
unfortunate that so gifted a man should become insane every time he takes 
up the pen", and Mallarmé's friend, the painter Edgar Degas, 
came out from his lecture, and crying "I do not understand, I do not 
understand." </p><p>Challenging his readers, Mallarmé sought out from a 
dictionary the long-forgotten meanings of common words and used these. 
Naturally this provoked a hostility, that followed Mallarmé through 
his career. To Proust's attack he answered in<i> The Mystery in 
Literature</i>: "Every piece of writing, on the outside of its 
treasure, must-out of respect for those from whom, after all, it 
borrows the language, for a different purpose-present with the words 
a meaning, even if an unimportant one: there is an advantage to turning 
away the idler, who is charmed that nothing here concerns him at first 
sight." </p>
<p>According to Mallarmé's theories, nothing lies beyond 
reality, but within this nothingness lie the essence of perfect 
forms. It is the task of the poet to reveal and crystallize these 
essences. Mallarmé's poetry employs condensed figures and 
unorthodox syntax. He believed that the point of a poem was the 
beauty of the language. "You don't make a poem with ideas, 
but with words." Thus a poem should be read as an object 
independent of the world in which it existed. But sometimes he 
became bored of the antique gardens of words, where he wanted 
to live: "The flesh grows weary. And books, I've read 
them all. / Off, then, to where I glimpse through spray and 
squall / Strange birds delighting in their unknown 
skies!" <font size="2">(from 'Seabreeze')</font> Each 
poem is built around a central symbol, idea, or metaphor and 
consists of subordinate images that illustrate and help to 
develop the idea. However, he preferred to hint between the l
ines at meanings rather than state them 
clearly. "<i>Nommer</i> un object, c'est supprimer 
les trois-quarts de la jouissance du poème qui est 
fait peu à peu: le <i>suggérer</i>." The 
reader must return over and over again to the lines, 
concentrate on the music of the words rather than the 
referential meaning. Once he stated: "I become obscure, 
of course! if one makes a mistake and thinks one is opening a 
newspaper."</p>
<p>For the rest of his life Mallarmé devoted himself to 
putting his literary theories into practice and writing his 
<i>Grand Oeuvre</i> (Great Work). Mallarmé died in Paris, 
on September 9, 1898 without completing this work. Mallarmé's 
<i>vers libre</i> had a huge influence on twentieth century French 
poetry, and in the creation of the modernist tradition in German and 
American poetry. </p>
