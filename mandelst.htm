<p>Russian poet and essayist, who is regarded alongside <a href="../../../pasterna.htm">Boris Pastenak</a>, <a href="../../../tsveta.htm">Marina Tsvetaeva</a>
and Anna Akhmatova as one of the greatest voices of the 20th-century
Russian poetry. Most of Mandelstam's works were unknown outside his own
country and went unpublished during the Stalin era (1929-53). Along
with <a href="../../../aakhma.htm">Anna Akhmatova</a>, Mandelstam was
one of the foremost members of Acmeist school of poetry. His early
works were impersonal but later he also analyzed his own experiences,
history, and the current events.</p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"Perhaps my whisper was already born before my lips.</font></b><font size="2"></font><b><font size="2">"</font></b> 

</blockquote>
<p>Osip Mandelstam was born in Warsaw, but he grew up in St.Petersburg,
the city which he celebrated in many of his poems. Mandelstam's parents
were Jewish, but not very religious. Mandelstam himself was baptized a
Lutheran in Finland. Emil Veniaminovich Mandelstam, his father, was a
successful leather-goods dealer, who had&nbsp;broken with
religious&nbsp;beliefs in his youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father had
absolutely no language; his speech was tongue-tie and
languagelessness," he once recalled. "The Russian speech of a Polish
Jew? No. The speech of a German Jew? No again." Mandelstam's mother,
Flora&nbsp;Osipovna Verblovskaya,&nbsp;came from Vilno;
she&nbsp;was&nbsp;a piano teacher. "The speech of my mother was clear
and sonorous without the least foreign accent." </p><p>At
home&nbsp;Mandelstam was first taught by tutors; French and and Swiss
governesses succeeded one another in the nursery. He then attended the
prestigious Tenishev School (1900-07),&nbsp; which was educationally
very advanced, and traveled then to Paris (1907-08) and Germany
(1908-10), where he studied Old French literature and the philosophy of
Kant at the University of Heidelberg (1909-10). In 1911-17 he studied
philosophy at St. Petersburg University but did not graduate. From
1911, Mandelstam was member of 'Poets Guild' and had close personal
ties with Anna Akhmatova and Nikolai Gumilev. His first poems appeared
in 1910 in the journal <i>Apollon</i>. </p>

<p>As a poet Mandelstam gained fame with the collection <em>Kamen</em>
(1913, Stone). The subject matters ranged from music to such triumphs
of culture as the Roman classical architecture and the Byzantine
cathedral of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. It was followed by <em>Tristia</em> (1922), which confirmed his position as a major poet, and <em>Stikhotvorenia</em>&nbsp; 1921-25<i></i>, (1928). In <i>Tristia</i> Mandelstam made connections with the classical world and contemporary Russia as in <i>Kamen</i>. A new themes was the notion of exile. The mood is sad, the poet is saying his farewells:<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"I have studied science of saying good-bye / in bareheaded laments at night".</p>

<p>Mandelstam welcomed February 1917 Revolution but he was hostile at
first to October 1917 Revolution. When Yakov Blyumkin, a revolutionary
terrorist, boasted in a café of having a pile of presigned deat
warrants, Mandelstam tore them to shreds. In 1918 he worked briefly for
Anatoly Lunacharskii's Education Ministry in Moscow. With his frequent
visits to the south Mandelstam managed to avoid much of the troubles
that complicated everyday life during the Civil War. After Revolution
his views about contemporary poetry became harsh. The poetry of young
people was for him a ceaseless cry of an infant, Mayakovsky was
childish and <a href="../../../tsveta.htm">Marina Tsvetaeva</a> tasteless. He only accepted Pasternak and also admired Akhmatova. </p>
<p>In 1922 Mandelstam married Nadezhda Iokovlevna Khazin, who
accompanied him throughout his years of exile and imprisonment. In the
1920s Mandelstam supported himself by writing children's books and
translating works by Upton Sinclair, Jules Romains, Charles de Coster
and others. He did not compose poems from 1925 to 1930 but turned to
prose. In 1930 he made a trip to Armenia. Mandelstam saw his role as an
outsider and drew parallels with his fate and that of Pushkin. The
importance of preserving the cultural tradition became for the poet a
central concern. The Soviet cultural authorities were rightly
suspicious of his loyalty to the Bolshevik rule. "What a great thing is
a police station!" Mandelstam often said, repeating Khlebnikov's lines.
"The place where I have my rendezvous with the State." To escape his
influential enemies Mandelstam traveled as a journalist in the distant
provinces. Mandelstam's<i> Journey to Armenia</i> was his last major work published during his life time. Heavily censored, it appeared in a journal in 1933. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"We live, deaf to the land beneath us, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Ten steps away no one hears our speeches, </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>But where there's so much as a half a conversation </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">The Kremlin's mountaineer will get his mention." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'Stalin,' 1934) </font></blockquote>

<p>Mandelstam was arrested first time in 1934 for epigram he had
written on Joseph
Stalin, the "Kremlin mountaineer, the murderer and peasant-slayer" as
he called him. "And every killing is a treat / For the broad-chested
Ossete." Possibly he believet that the poem would the spark that would
set off a change. <br>
</p>
      <p>Mandelstam was arrested on a warrant signed by Genrikh
Grigoryevich Yagoda, the head of the Soviet Secret Police, known as the
Cheka. (Yagoda himself was shot in 1938.) At prison Mandelstam was
tortured tortured physically and mentally. Stalin took a personal
interst in Mandelstam, with whom he played cat and mouse. He also had a
telephone conversation with Boris Pasternak, asking whether he had been
present when the lampoon about himself, Stalin, was recited by
Mandelstam. Pasternak answered that it seemed to him of no importance. "Mandelstam will be all right," promised the dictator. When he wanted to speak with Stalin about very 
important matters, "about life and death," the phone was hung up. </p>


<p>After being signed out from Lubyanka, Mandelstam asked Nadezhda: "Is the future behind us or ahead of us?" Half insane from the prison experience, he was exiled with
his wife to Cherdyn, the oldest city of Ural. After suicide attempt,
his sentence
was commuted to exile in Voronezh, ending in 1937. In his notebooks
from Voronezh (1935-37) Mandelstam said, "He thinks in bone and feels
with his brow / And tries to recall his human form"<font face="Symbol"> </font><font face="Symbol">- </font>eventually 
the poet identifies himself with his tormentor.</p>
<p>During this period Mandelstam wrote for Natasha Shtempel, his brave friend in the hard conditions, 
a poem in which he again gave women the role of mourning and preserving: "To accompany the resurrected 
and to be the first / To welcome the dead is their vocation. / And to demand caresses from them is criminal." 
Mandelstam was arrested 
for "counter-revolutionary" activities in May 1938 and sentenced to five years in a labour camp. 
Interrogated by Nikolay Shivarov, he confessed that he had authored a counter-revolutionary a poem which 
begins with the lines: "We live without sensing the country beneath us, / At ten paces, our speech 
has no sound / And when there's the will to half-open our mouths / The Kremlin crag-dweller bars the 
way."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font>In the transit camp, Mandelstam was already 
so weak that he couldn't stand. He died of starvation and madness in the Gulag Archipelago in Vtoraia rechka, near Vladivostok, 
on December 27, 1938. His body was taken to a common grave. </p>

<p>Mandelstam's widow kept her husband's legacy alive against all odds.
Nearly homeless, she had virtually&nbsp;as much
material&nbsp;possessions as a convict; the most expensive item in her
one-room apartment on the outskirst of Moscow was a cuckoo clock.
During the war years Anna Akhmatova helped her to&nbsp;escape to
Tashkent, where she taught Englist at the Central Asian State
University. </p><p>International fame Osip Mandelstam started to acclaim in the 1970s, when his 
works began to appear in the West and in the Soviet Union. Nadezhda 
Mandelstam memoirs, &nbsp;<em>Hope Against Hope</em> (1970) and <em>Hope Abandoned</em>&nbsp;
(1974), depicted their life and Stalin era. They first circulated
underground, excerpts appeared in official journals,
and&nbsp;eventually&nbsp; they were published abroad. Mandelstam's <i>Voronez poems</i>,&nbsp;which came out&nbsp;in 1990, are the closest approximation what the poet planned to write if he had survived. </p>
<p>Mandelstam wrote a wide range of essays. 'Conversations about Dante'
has been considered a masterpiece of modern criticism with its fanciful
use of analogies. 'I compare, therefore I am,' so Dante might have put
it. He was the Descartes of metaphor. Because matter is revealed to our
consciousness (and how could we experience someone else's?) through
metaphor alone, because there is no existence outside comparison,
because existence itself is comparion." Mandelstam says that Pushkin's
"splendid white teeth are the masculine pearls of Russian poetry", he
sees the <i>Divine Comedy</i> as a "journey with conversations", and
draws attention to Dante's use of colors. Writing is constantly
compared to making music. " </p>
