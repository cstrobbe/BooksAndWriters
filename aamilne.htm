creator of
Winnie-the-Pooh. Milne wrote many different kinds of books, humorous
verses and light comedies as a staff member of <i>Punch</i>, and the
detective novel <em>The Red House Mystery</em> (1922), which was
severely criticized by <a href="rchandle.htm">Raymond Chandler</a>.
But Milne's most popular works are Winnie-the Pooh&nbsp;(1926) and <em>The
House at Pooh Corner</em>&nbsp;(1928). In spite of his fame as a
children's book writer, Milne was not "inordinately fond" of children. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"On Wednesday, when the sky is
blue, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">And I have nothing else to do, </font><br>
        <font size="2">I sometimes wonder if it's true </font><br>
        <font size="2">That who is what and what is who."</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Winnie-the-Pooh</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Alan Alexander Milne was born in London. His father owned a
private school at Mortiner Road, the Henley House. Among the teachers
were, for some time, the science fiction writer H.G. Wells. A gifted
mathematician, Milne won a scholarship to Westminster School when he
was only eleven. He studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,
and edited the undergraduate magazine<i> Granta</i>. After receiving
his B.A. in 1903, he started his career as a freelance writer. Milne's
essays and poems were published in the satirical magazine <i>Punch</i>
and <i>St. James' Gazette</i>. In 1906 he joined the staff of <i>Punch</i>,
becoming the magazine's assistant editor. </p>
      <p>At H.G. Wells's suggestion Milne turned some of his sketches
into a novel. His first book,<em> Lovers in London</em>,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1905. His next books were collections of his <i>Punch</i>
pieces. In the 1910s he became well known as a playwright, notably for <em>Mr
Pim Passes By</em>&nbsp;(1919). In 1913 Milne married Dorothy de
Sêlincourt&nbsp;&#8211; "She laughed at my jokes," he&nbsp;said later in his
autobiography. Their only son, Christopher Robin Milne, was born in
1920. During World War I Milne served in the Royal Warwickshire
Regiment as a signals officer. He was posted to France briefly in 1916
and wrote propaganda for the Intelligence service. The horrors he
witnessed in the war left him a lifelong nostalgia for the idyllic
fantasies of childhood. "A 'children's book' must be written, not for
children, but for the author himself," he once said. When the
disillusioned post-war writers depicted the "lost generation" of the
1920s, Milne returned in his Pooh books into the safety of his early
years. </p>
      <p>After the war <em>The Dover Road</em>&nbsp;(1921) continued
Milne's success.&nbsp;<em>Toad of Toad Hall </em>(1929), based on
Kenneth Grahame's <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> (1908), seems to
have survived perhaps better than&nbsp;his original work.&nbsp;Milne's
plays were produced in London and in Broadway and their popularity
enabled him to buy in 1925 a country home, Cotchford Farm, in Sussex.
Most of the time the family still spent in London, going down to
Cotchford only at week-ends. There, in a small and dark room, with a
window that looked over the courtyard, Milne wrote his works, smoking
his pipe. And after dinner, he usually solved crosswords. </p>
      <p>Milne's <em>The Red House Mystery</em> draws heavily on the
tradition of Sherlock Holmes. Its lack of realistic details and cosy
atmosphere prompted Raymond Chandler to write: "The detective in the
case in an insouciant amateur named Anthony Gillingman, a nice lad with
a cheery eye, a cosy little flat in London, and that airy manner... The
English police seem to endure him with their customary stoicism; but I
shudder to think of what the boys down at the Homicide Bureau in my
city would do to him." <font size="2">(from 'The Simple Art of Murder')</font>
Milne's other mysteries include <em>Four Days' Wonder</em> (1933) and
the drama <em>The Fourth Wall</em>, which was made into a film under
the little <i>The Perfect Alibi</i>. </p>
      <p>At the age of 42 Milne published <em>When We Were Very Young</em>,
a collection of poetry for children. It was illustrated by his friend
and colleague from <i>Punch</i>, E.H. Shepard, who was paid fifty
pounds for the job. <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i>. followed two years later.
These hugely popular stories were set in Ashdown forest. They feature
Milne's son Christopher (1920-1996) with various talking animals and
animated versions of his toys&nbsp;&#8211; among them the famous teddy-bear,
Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore, and others. The stories were originally
illustrated by E.H. Shepard. He traveled to Sussex, where the Milne
family lived, visited the pine trees and other places, and Christopher
Robin and his stuffed animals. <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i> (1928)
continued the adventures of Pooh Bear and his friends. Later Pooh
became an industry, producing toys, comics, and such films as <i>Winnie-the-Pooh
and the Honey Tree</i> (1996) from Disney. Shepard illustrated books
for nearly thirty years, among them Grahame's <em>The Wind in the
Willows</em>. </p>
      <p>Winnie-the-Pooh has been the target of psychological
analysis&nbsp;&#8211; noteworthy is the absence of Christopher Robin's
mother. However, this is not a unique trait of the book. Walt Disney
also left mothers (and fathers) out of the world of Donald Duck and
Mickey Mouse. Religious imagery is missing from the book, too. Milne
kept his religious beliefs to himself, but recorded his thoughts in <em>The
Norman Church</em>&nbsp;(1948). His son Christopher received a
conventional religious education, but though he was given two Christian
names, he was never christened, nor confirmed. Milne left him to
develop his own religious beliefs.</p>
      <p>Christopher Milne has later confessed that he had problems
coping with the legendary literary figure created about him.&nbsp;He
also said that his mother, Daphne, invented stories about toy animals
and provided most of the material for his father's books. His
relationship with his&nbsp;parents Christopher Milne analyzed in <i>Enchanted
Places </i>(1975), in which he emphasized that his father did not feel
sentimental about children.&nbsp;Noteworthy,&nbsp;Milne's&nbsp;famous
poem 'Vespers'&nbsp;&#8211; beautifully sung by Vera Lynn&nbsp;&#8211; is actually
about a little boy who is pretending to say his prayers. "... prayers
means nothing to a child of three, whose thoughts are engaged with
other, more exciting matters...", Milne wrote in 'Preface to
Parents'.&nbsp;Dorothy Milne&nbsp;sent it originally to <i>Vanity Fair</i>
in New York, where it was published in January 1923. Christopher Robin
described 'Vespers' as "the one [work] that has brought me over the
years more toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment than
any other." </p>
      <p>In the 1930s and 40s Milne was active in religious and
pacifist polemics. He was certain that war would extinguish
civilization.&nbsp;Milne recognized the threat of Nazi Germany and
Fascist Italy but regarded preparations for defense as dangerous to
peace as preparations for war. At the age of fifty-six he published his
autobiography, <em>It's Too Late Now</em>&nbsp;(1938), which focused
mostly on his childhood years. For the Pooh books he devoted eight
"rather unhappy" pages,&nbsp;as Christopher Milne put it. </p>
      <p>During WW II,&nbsp; after <a href="pgwod.htm">P.G. Wodehouse</a>
made some light-hearted broadcasts from Germany for CBS radio shortly
after being captured in 1940, Milne broke with his former friend and
became his bitter opponent. "We were supposed to be quite good friends,
but, you know, in a sort of way I think he was a pretty jealous chap",
Wodehouse explained later in an interview. "I think he was probably
jealous of all other writers." Milne gave up his pacifism for a period.
Like many famous British authors, from H.G. Wells and Somerset Maugham
to C.S. Forester, he was enlisted by the British Information Services
(BIS) to do propaganda work. In Hartfield and Forest Row he served as a
Captain of the Home Guard. Christopher Milne&nbsp;fought&nbsp;in the
Middle East and Italy. </p>
      <p>An operation on Milne's brain in 1952 left him an invalid
during the last four years of his life. He died in Hartfield, Sussex,
on January 31, 1956. After his wife's death in 1971, part of the
fortune earned by the Pooh books came to the Royal Literary Fund,
providing for writers in financial distress. When <em>Winnie-the Pooh</em>
was first published in the United States, Milne wrote a tribute to his
collaborator Ernest Shephard: "When I am gone / Let Shephard decorate
my tomb, / And put (if there is room) / Two pictures on the stone; /
Piglet from page a hundred and eleven / And Pooh and Piglet walking
(157) . . . / And Peter, thinking that they are my own, / Will welcome
me to heaven." </p>
