<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist and critic, the
founder of the Naturalist movement in literature. Zola redefined
Naturalism as "Nature seen through a temperament." Among Zola's most
important works is his famous <i>Rougon-Macquart</i> cycle (1871-1893), which included such novels as&nbsp;<em>L'Assommoir</em> (1877), about the suffering of the Parisian working-class, <em>Nana </em>(1880), dealing with prostitution, and <em>Germinal</em>
(1885), depicting the mining industry. Zola's open letter 'J'accuse,'
on January 13, 1898, reopened the case of the Jewish Captain, Alfred
Dreyfus, sentenced to Devil's Island. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am little concerned with beauty or
perfection. I don't care for the great centuries. All I care about is
life, struggle, intensity. I am at ease in my generation."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">My Hates</font></i><font size="2">, 1866) </font></blockquote>
<p>Emile Zola was born in Paris. His father, François Zola, was an
Italian engineer, who acquired French citizenship. Zola spent his
childhood in Aix-en-Provence, southeast France, where the family moved
in 1843. When Zola was seven, his father died, leaving the family with
money problems &#8211; Emilie Aubert, his mother, was largely dependent on a
tiny pension. In 1858 Zola moved with her to Paris. In his youth he
became friends with the painter Paul Cézanne, who was his class-mate.
Zola's widowed mother had planned a career in law for him. Zola,
however, failed his baccalaureate examination &#8211; as later did the writer
<a href="afrance.htm">Anatole France</a>, who failed several times but
finally passed. According to one story, Zola was sometimes so broke
that he ate sparrows that he trapped on his window sill. </p>
<p>Zola began to write under the influence of the romantics. Before his
breakthrough, Zola worked as a clerk in a shipping firm and then in the
sales department of the publishing house of
Louis-Christophe-Francois-Hachette. He also contributed literary
columns and art reviews to the Cartier de Villemessant's newspapers.
Zola supported the struggle of Edouard Manet and the Impressionists; Manet
thanked him with a portrait. As a political journalist Zola did not
hide his antipathy toward the French Emperor Napoleon III, who used the
Second Republic as a springboard to become Emperor. </p>
<p>During his formative years Zola wrote several short stories and essays, 4 plays and 3 novels. Among his early books was <em>Contes à Ninon</em>, which was published in 1864. When his sordid autobiographical novel <em>La Confession&nbsp;de Claude</em> (1865) was published and attracted the attention of the police, Zola was fired from Hachette. </p>
<p>Zola did not much believe in the possibility of individual freedom,
but emphasized that "events arise fatally, implacably, and men, either
with or against their wills, are involved in them. Such is the absolute
law of human progress." Inspired by Claude Bernard's <i>Introduction à la médecine expérimentale</i>
(1865) Zola tried to adjust scientific principles in the process of
observing society and interpreting it in fiction. Thus a novelist, who
gathers and analyzes documents and other material, becomes a part of
the scientific research. His treatise, <em>Le Roman Experimental</em>
(1880), manifested the author's faith in science and acceptance of
scientific determinism. Zola was obsessed with counting, counting
lamp-posts, trees, doorways, and sought to take all of the
&#8220;unpredictable&#8221; out of life. <br>
 </p>
<p>After his first major novel,<em> Thérèse Raquin</em> (1867), Zola began the long series called <i>Les Rougon Macquart</i>,
the natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire. "I
want to portray, at the outset of a century of liberty and truth, a
family that cannot restrain itself in its rush to possess all the good
things that progress is making available and is derailed by its own
momentum, the fatal convulsions that accompany the birth of a new
world." The family had two branches &#8211; the Rougons were small
shopkeepers and petty bourgeois, and the Marquarts were poachers and
smugglers who had problems with alcohol. Some members of the family
would rise during the story to the highest levels of the society, some
would fall as victims of social evils and heredity. <br>
</p>
      <p>Zola presented the idea to his publisher in 1868. "The
Rougon-Macquart &#8211; the group, the family, whom I propose to study &#8211; has
as its prime characteristic the overflow of appetite, the broad
upthrust of our age, which flings itself into enjoyments.
Physiologically the members of this family are the slow working-out of
accidents to the blood and nervous system which occur in a race after a
first organic lesion, according to the environment determining in each
of the individuals of this race sentiments, desires, passions, all the
natural and instinctive human manifestations whose products take on the
conventional names of virtues and vices." </p>

<p>At first the plan was limited to 10 books, but ultimately the series
comprised 20 volumes, ranging in subject from the world of peasants and
workers to the imperial court. Zola prepared his novels carefully. The
result was a combination of precise documentation, accurate portrayals,
and dramatic imagination; the last had actually little to do with his
Naturalist theories. Zola interviewed experts, prepared thick dossiers,
made thoughtful portraits of his protagonists, and outlined the action
of each chapter. He rode in the cab of a locomotive when he was
preparing <em>La Bête humaine</em> (1890, The Beast in Man), and for <i>Germinal</i> he visited coal mines. This was something very different from Balzac's volcanic creative writing process, which produced<i> La Comédie humaine</i>, a social saga of nearly 100 novels. <i>The Beast in Man</i>
was adapted for screen for the first time in 1938. The director, Jean
Renoir wrote the screenplay with Zola's daughter, Denise Leblond-Zola.
In the film Séverine (Simone Simon) wants her lover, the locomotive
engineer Lantier (Jean Gabin), to kill her stationmaster husband.
Lentier, an honest and proud man, cannot do it, but in a fit of anger
and frustration he strangles his beloved instead and commits suicide by
throwing himself off a fast moving train. </p>
<p>With <i>L'Assommoir </i>(1877, Drunkard), a depiction of alcoholism,
Zola became the best-known writer in France, who attracted crowds
imitators and disciples, to his great annoyance: "I want to shout out
from the housetops that I am not a chef d'ecole, and that I don't want
any disciples," Zola once said. His personal appearance &#8211; once somebody
said that he had the head of a philosopher and the body of an athlete &#8211;
was known to everybody. Following the publication of <span class="st"><em>Les Soirées de Médan</em> </span>(1880),
Guy de Maupassant jokingly suggested that Zola's country house at Médan
should be visited with the same interest as the Palace of Versailles
and other historical places. Zola lived there eight months in the year,
and the other four month in Paris. </p>
<p><i>Nana</i>, about a young Parisian prostitute, took the reader to
the world of sexual exploitation. In general, sex was a central element
in Zola's novels. The book was a huge success in France but in Britain
it was attacked by moralists. Henry Vizetelly, who had published several
Zola translations from the <i>Rougon-Macquart</i> series, was imprisoned on charges of obscenity. The translation of <em>La Terre</em> (1887) practically ruined Vizetelly &amp; Company.<i> Germinal</i>,
one of Zola's finest novels, came out in 1885. It was the first major
work on a strike, based on his research notes on labor conditions in
the coal mines. <i>Germinal </i>was criticized by right-wing political groups as a call to revolution. Zola's tetralogy, <em>Les Quatre Evangiles</em>, which started with&nbsp;<em>Fécondité</em> (1899), was left unfinished. </p>

<p>Also notable in Zola's career was his involvement in the Dreyfus affair with his open letter&nbsp;<em>J'accuse</em>.
"In making these accusations, I am fully aware that my action comes
under Articles 30 and 31 of the law of 29 July 1881 on the press, which
makes libel a punishable offence," Zola wrote defiantly. Alfred
Dreyfus (1859-1935) was a French Jewish army officer, who was falsely
charged with giving military secrets to the Germans. The trials quickly
developed into a ideological struggle, or as Anatole France wrote,
"rendered an inestimable service to the country by bringing out and
little by little revealing the forces of past and the forces of future:
on the one side bourgeois authoritarianism and Catholic theocracy; on
the other side socialism and free thought." <br>
</p>
      <p>Dreyfus was transported to Devil's Island in French Guiana.
The case was tried again in 1899 and he was found first guilty and
pardoned, but later the verdict was reversed. "The truth is on the
march, and nothing shall stop it," Zola announced, but during the
process he was sentenced in 1898 to imprisonment and removed from the
roll of the Legion of Honor. He escaped to England, where he settled in
Essex as 'M. Jacques Beauchamp'. Zola's plan to publish an album of
English anecdotes illustrated by photographs was never realized. While
not writing, he read the <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> with the help of an English dictionary and watched a bit of cricket. <br>
</p>

<p>It was not until 1906 that the French appeal court quashed Dreyfus's
sentence, but Zola did not see his campaing vindicated. After being
pardoned he returned to France as a hero. Zola died on September
28,1902, in Paris, under mysterious circumstances,
overcome by carbon monoxide fumes in his sleep. According to some
speculations, Zola's enemies, the agents of the anti-Dreyfusard
faction, blocked the chimney of his apartment,
causing poisonous fumes to build up and kill him. At Zola's funeral
Anatole France declared, "He was a moment of the human conscience." When Zola's remains were transported to the Panthéon in
1908, Dreyfus was openly attacked in the street. A Paris court acquitted his assailant. Naturalism as a
literary movement fell gradually out of favor, but Zola's
integrity had a profound influence on such writers as <a href="dreiser.htm">Theodore Dreiser</a>, <a href="strindbe.htm">August Strindberg</a> and Emilia Pardo-Bazan. </p>
