      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American poet, novelist,
and writer of short stories, best-known for <em>John Brown'sBody</em>,
a long epic poem on the Civil War, which Benét wrote in France. Benét
received two Pulitzer prizes for his poetry. He was one of those rare
poets who was both popular and critically acclaimed. </p>

        <font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> John Brown's Body</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Stephen Vincent Benét was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
into an army family. His father was Colonel J. Walker Benét. Frances
Neill (Rose) Benét, Stephen's mother, was a descendant of an old
Kentucky military family. Because his father was an avid reader, who
especially loved poetry, Benét grew up in home, where literature was
valued and enjoyed. Most of his boyhood Benét spent in Benicia,
California. At the age about ten, Benét was sent to the Hitchcock
Military Academy. However, he preferred reading to athletics and did
not like the insensitivity of his school mates. Later wrote about his
experiences in his poem about Shelley at Eton: "His pile of books scattered about his feet, /
Stood Shelley while two others held him fast, / And the clods beat upon
him." Benét completed his secondary education in Augusta, Georgia,
where his father had been assigned a new post. Benét's first book, <em>Five
Men and Pompey </em>(1915), a collection of verse, was published when
he was 17. It showed the romantic influence of William Morris as well
as the influence of modern realism. </p>
      <p>Benét was rejected from the army because of his defective
vision. During the war he worked in Washington as a cipher-clerk in the
same department as James Thurber, who also had poor eyesight. Benét
received from Yale his master's degree, submitting his third volume of
poems, <em>Heavens and Earth&nbsp;</em> (1920), instead of a thesis.
In Yale his contemporaries included <a href="twilder.htm">Thronton
Wilder</a> and Archibald MacLeish. </p>
      <p>Benét's first novel, the autobiographical <em>The Beginning
of Wisdom</em> (1921), showed the influence of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He
continued his studies at Sorbonne, France, where lived somewhat
bohemian life and met his wife and moral compass of his life, the
writer and journalist Rosemary Carr. Many of his playful love poems
were collected in <em>Tiger Joy</em> (1925). Sylvia Beach, who ran the
Shakespeare and Company bookstore on Paris's Left Bank,&nbsp;brought
him to meet Gertude Stein.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Back in Benét in the United States, Benét set out to make a
living as a writer. In New York City the family lived first at 220 East
69th Street between Third and Second Avenues, and then at 215 East
68th. Visitors often dropped by without prior notice. Benét's study was
full of books, from the floor to ceiling, in piles on tables and chairs
and spilling onto the carpet. An omnivorous reader himself,&nbsp;Benét
used to read aloud to his children in the evening after dinner, Tales
of King Arthur, Kilping, Oz books, Arthur Conan Doyle. </p>
      <p>During the 1920s he&nbsp;published the&nbsp;novels, <em>Young
People's Pride</em> (1922), serialized in <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>,<em>
Jean Huguenot </em>(1923), and <em>Spanish Bayonet&nbsp;</em> (1926),
a historical novel about the 18th-century Florida dealing with Benét's
ancestors. With John Farrar he wrote two plays, <em>Nerves</em> and <em>That
Awful Mrs. Eaton</em>, which opened and closed in September 1924. After
their failure he did not attempt any form of dramatic for several
years. In 1930 he worked with Gerrit Lloyd on the screenplay for D.W.
Griffith film <em>Abraham Lincoln</em>. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1926 Benét won a Guggenheim fellowship, enabled him to
focus solely on writing, without constantly worrying about money and
bills. With his wife, he went back to France, where he lived for four
years, and started to&nbsp;work&nbsp;on&nbsp;his poem about the Civil
War, <i>John Brown's Body</i>. "So, from a hundred visions, I make
one, / And out of darkness build my mocking sun." Already in his
childhood, Benét had been fascinated by his father's old Rebellion
Records and his <i>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</i>. While in
France, he collected background material from libraries for the poem,
which became a bestseller, won the <a href="pulitzer.htm">Pulitzer</a>
Prize for Poetry, and has remained in print since its publication. Seen
from the perspective of a young, small town boy, it interweaved stories
of historical and fictional figures, from the raid of Harper's Ferry to
General Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. Benét's collection
of verse appeared with the acclaim of critics, although Harriet Moore
labelled it a "cinematic epic" in <i>Poetry,</i> and some other
critics, in tune with the times, tried to find from it important social
issues. </p>
      <p>Benét's financial success was brief: he lost almost all of his
earnings to the stock market crash. Before starting any new
work,&nbsp;he published a collection of ballads and poems, written over
a period of fifteen years. It celebrated American names and people,
such as William Sycamore, whose "... father, he was a mountaineer / His
fist was a knotty hammer..."&nbsp; </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I have fallen in love with
American names,</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">The sharp names that never get fat,</font><br>
        <font size="2">The snakeskin titles of mining claims,</font><br>
        <font size="2">The plumed war bonnet of Medicine Hat,</font><br>
        <font size="2">Tucson and Deadwood and Lost Mule Flat."</font></b></blockquote>
      <p>Benét was elected in 1929 to the National Institute of Arts
and Letters and nine years later to the American Academy of Arts and
Letters. In the 1930s Benét published among others <em>A Book of
Americans </em>(1933) with his wife. It was nostalgic excursion to the
past, "When Daniel Boone goes by, at night, / The phantom deer arise /
And all lost, wild America / Is burning in their eyes." Benét popular
poem, 'American Names,'&nbsp;which appeared&nbsp;first in <em>Ballads
and Poems </em>(1931), ended with the famous&nbsp;line 'Bury my heart
at Wounded Knee.' </p>
      <p><em>James Shore's Daughter</em> (1934), a story about wealth
and responsibility, is usually considered among Benét's best
achievements. <em>The Burning City </em>(1936) included the bitter
'Litany for Dictatorships,' in which Benét attacked fascism and mass
mentality: "We are all good citizens here. We believe in the / Perfect
State." <em>The Headless Horseman</em> (1937) was an one-act play,
inspired by Washington Irving's story.</p>
      <p><em>Thirteen O'Clock </em>(1937) included the
celebrated&nbsp;'The Devil and Daniel Webster', originally published in
the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>. It was later made into a play, and
opera (music by Douglas Moore), and a motion picture entitled <em>All
That Money Can Buy</em>, directed by William Dieterle and starring
Walter Huston as Mr. Scratch. The music by Bernard Herrmann was awarded
an Oscar. In the story a hard-pressed farmer, Jabez Stone, makes a deal
with the Devil, but is saved from the pit by a famous lawyer's pleading
at his 'trial.' The jury which he calls to hear Webster's case in
compounded out of the greatest villains of American history. Benét
based his tale on Faust, but set it in the 19th-century New England.
This work had two sequels, 'Daniel Webster and the Sea Serpent' (1937)
and 'Daniel Webster and the Ideas of March' (1939).</p>
      <p>The short story 'Sobbin' Women,' collected in <em>Thirteen
O'Clock</em>, later inspired Stanley Donen's musical film <span style="font-style: italic;">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</span>
(1954), starring Howard Keel and Jane Powell. The story was taken from
Plutarch's tale of the kidnapping and rape of the Sabine women, but its
beginning also had similarities with <a href="akivi.htm">Aleksis Kivi</a>'s novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Seven Brothers</span> (Seitsemän veljestä)
from 1870, which came out in English in 1929. </p>
      <p>In 'Johnny Pye and the Fool-Killer,' published in <em>Tales
Before Midnight </em>(1939), Benét Americanized the Death, whom the
hero outsmarts by refusing to accept an offer of immortality. Besides
the horror, mystery and fantastic, Benét was interested in science
fiction. The dystopic tale, 'By the Waters of Babylon'&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1937, years before the Atomic Bomb. The tale was set in the
future, in a world after the Great Burning&nbsp;<strong><font size="2">&#8211;</font></strong>
the fire which fell out of the sky. Poor vision had plagued Benét
throughout his life, and he was also crippled by arthritis and suffered
a bout of mental illness. These personal problems perhaps affected his
later fantasies, such as 'The Minister's Books' and 'The Angel Was a
Yankee,' collected in <em>The Last Circle </em>(1946). </p>
      <p>Benét also made
a number of radio broadcasts and worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter.
He wrote a series of radio scripts, including <em>Listen to the People
      </em>(1941) and <em>They Burned the Books </em>(1942). His
short stories, produced during these years, were often written under
pressure to pay bills. In the early 1940s Benét was a strong advocate
of America's entry into the war&nbsp;<strong><font size="2">&#8211;</font></strong>
in the United Nations Day speech President Roosevelt read a prayer
specially composed by the author. The antifascist poem <em>Nightmare
at Noon</em> (1940), published in <em>Life</em>&nbsp;magazine, became
a national sensation.&nbsp;For the Office of War Information Benét
wrote a short history of the United States, which was translated and
distributed in Europe. Benét died of a heart attack in New York City,
on March 13, 1943. He was posthumously awarded in 1944 the Pulitzer
Prize for <em>Western Star</em>. The poem was the first volume of a
large verse epic about the American frontier. Benét's elder brother,
William Rose Benét, become a journalist, and a Pulitzer Prize winner,
who helped found the <i>Saturday Review of Literature</i>. Benét's <i>The
Reader's Encyclopedia</i> (1948) was for decades the standard American
guide to world literature. </p>
