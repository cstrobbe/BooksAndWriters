<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> Anglo-American novelist and playwright,
best known for his stories about Berlin in the early 1930s. Christopher
Isherwood's novels were based largely on his own life. Many of his
famous literary friends appeared in his books under different names,
including W.H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Virginia Woolf. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am a camera with its shuter open,
quite passive, recording, not thinking. Recording the man shaving at
the window opposite and the woman in the kimono washing her hair. Some
day, all this will have to be developed, carefully printed, fixed."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Goodbye to Berlin</font></i><font size="2">, 1939) </font></blockquote>

<p>Christopher Isherwood was born in Disley, Chesire, the son of an
army officer, who was killed in World War I. The family had lived in
the neighboring village of Marple since the sixteenth century, when, as
successful farmers, they were able to buy 'The Hall' &#8211; an Elizabethan
mansion &#8211; standing in a big waterlogged park. In his childhood
Isherwood travelled around with his father's regiment. <br>
</p>
      <p>Isherwood was sent in 1914 to St. Edmund's preparatory school,
where he made friends with the future poet, W.H. Auden. Later he wrote
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lions and Shadows</span> (1938):
"I had arrived at my public school thoroughly sick of masters and
mistresses, having been emotionally messed about by them at my
preparatory school, where the war years had given full licence to every
sort of dishonest cant about loyalty, selfishness, patriotism, playing
the game and dishonouring the dead." Isherwood studied at Repton School
and in 1925 at Corpus Christi Cambridge, without taking a degree. After
Cambridge he worked for a time as a secretary to André Mangeot, a
French violinist, and earned also his living as a private tutor. From
1930 to 1933 he taught English in Germany. Isherwood's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">All the Conspirators</span>, came out in 1928. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">The Memorial</span> (1934), both exploring the English middle-class world in the 1920s. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The audience took the fights dead
seriously, shouting encouragements to the fighters, and even quarreling
and betting amongst themselves or the results. Yet nearly all of them
had been in the tent as long as I had, and stayed after I had left. The
political moral is certainly depressing: these people could be made to
believe in anybody and anything."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Good-bye to Berlin</font></i><font size="2">, 1939) </font></blockquote>
<p>In the 1930 Isherwood wrote three prose-verse plays in collaboration
with his old school friend W.H. Auden. Prolonged visits to Germany
between 1929 and 1933 provided Isherwood with the material for his
best-known fictional work, popularly entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">The Berlin Stories</span>, but in actuality a pair of loosely structured novels: <span style="font-style: italic;">Mr Norris Changes Trains</span> (1935) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Goodbye to Berlin</span>
(1939). The depiction of the glittering and grotesque metropolis of
Germany, its cafés, night-people, and vices, was based on his
observations in the decadent Weimar Republic in pre-Hitler years. When
the narrator, William Bradshaw, first meets Arthur Norris in <i>Mr Norris Changes Trains</i>,
he notes that his eyes were "the eyes of a schoolboy surprised in the
act of breaking one of the rules. Not that I had caught him,
apparently, at anything excepts his own thoughts..." Other characters
include Sally Bowles, the embodiment of carefree individualism. <i>Goodbye to Berlin</i>
is considered among the most significant political novels of the 20th
century. Later the stories inspired the world famous musical <i>Cabaret</i>. <br>
</p>
      <p>Along with writers such as Auden, Cecil Day-Lewis, and Stephen
Spender, Isherwood was under the surveillance of the Security Service
(MI5), mainly due to his associate, Gerald Hamilton, whom he portrayed
in his semi-autobiographical novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Mr Norris Changes Trains</span>.
An adventurer by nature, Hamilton became involved in radical activities
in Germany, was imprisoned and expelled from Italy, and associated with
the Comintern propaganda chief Willi Münzenberg. Isherwood regarded him
as "a most incredible old crook". Partly to escape his everyday
routines, Isherwood started in 1938 with Auden a journey to China, and
recorded in <span style="font-style: italic;">Journey to a War</span>
(1939) his experiences in the country ravaged by civil war and a
Japanese invasion. With Auden he emigrated to the United States,
becoming an American citizen in 1946. </p>

<p>Isherwood settled in 1939 in southern California, where worked as a
teacher and wrote for Hollywood films. On the eve of the World War II,
he turned into pacifism. During the war years in 1941-42 he worked at a
Quaker hostel in Pennsylvania with refugees from Europe. In 1943 he
became a follower of Swami Prabhavananda, founder of the Vedãnta
Society of Southern California, producing several works on Indian
Vedãnta in the following decades. When a number of European exiles in
California, such as Bertolt Brecht and Theodor Adorno, did not
appreciate American tastes and culture, Isherwood felt affection for
the diversity of Los Angeles, its spiritualism, and the worship of
youth. As Terry Southern began working with his friend Isherwood on the
screenplay for MGM movie <i>The Loved One</i> 
(1965), he wanted Lenny Bruce to appear as the drunken "Dear Abby" columnist Guru Brahmin. 
The film was based on  <a href="ewaugh.htm">Evelyn Waugh</a>'s novel, in which the author parodied the extremes of 
American funeral and mourning customs and 
 fascination for Indian mysticism. </p>
<p>Isherwood's later  books include <span style="font-style: italic;">Prater Violet</span> (1945), a story of  filmmakers in prewar London. <span style="font-style: italic;">The World in the Evening</span>
(1954) was a study of a young writer who attempts to understand the
failure of his two marriages and his homosexual needs. "I was wearing
my usual crazy costume, the symbol of my protest against this life I
was leading: a white tuxedo jacket, with a crimson bow tie and
carnation to match my moiré cummerbund. Elizabeth, if she could have
seen me, would have said, "Darling, what on <i>earth </i>are you supposed to be? No &#8211; don't tell me. Let me guess...""  </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">A Single Man</span> (1965)
presented a single day in the life of George, a lonely, middle-aged
homosexual man, whose partner has died in a car accident. Isherwood
observes his character as if he were in an aquarium: "He crosses the
front room, which he calls his study, and comes down the staircase. The
stairs turn a corner; they are narrow and steep. You can touch both
handrails with your elbows, and you have to bend your head, even if,
like George, you are only five eight. This is a tightly planned little
house. He often feels protected by its smallness; there is hardly room
enough here to feel lonely..." In the retrospective autobiography, set
in the 1930s, <span style="font-style: italic;">Christopher and His Kind</span>
(1977), Isherwood examined his complex relationship with Auden &#8211; his
friend had died a few years before the book was published. <span style="font-style: italic;">Kathleen and Frank</span> (1971) was a double portrait of his parents, as seen through his mother's and father's letters. </p>
<p>With his guru Swami Prabhavananda Isherwood translated from the Sanskrit <i>The Bhagavad-Gita</i> and <i>The Yoga Aphorism of Patanjali</i>. Later he wrote a biography of Ramakrishna and his disciples (1965). <span style="font-style: italic;">My Guru and His Disciple</span>
(1980) broke from the strictly chronological format to create a
spiritual autobiography wherein the values of Vedanta Hinduism counter
his life as a Hollywood scriptwriter. From 1959 to 1962 Isherwood was a
guest professor at Los Angeles State College and the University of
California at Santa Barbara, teaching courses in creative writing. In
1965-66 he taught at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>
<p> Isherwood was one of the first internationally known figures to
admit that he was homosexual. From 1953 until his death, Isherwood
lived with his partner, the portrait artist Don Bachardy, who had also
other lovers; he called Isherwood "Dobbin." "And again and again I have
to remind myself that the whole art of life is to lean on people, to
involve oneself with them quite fearlessly and yet &#8211; when the props are
kicked away &#8211; remain leaning, as ot were, on empty air," Isherwood
wrote in his diary. In 1975 he won the Brandeis Medal for Fiction. With
his explicitly autobiographical works Isherwood become in the 1970s a
leading spokesman for gay rights, but in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Diaries:Volume Two 1960-1969</span>  (2010)  he kept a relatively reticent  line about sex. Isherwood died in Santa Monica, on January 4, 1986. </p>

<br>
- Bob Fosse's film Cabaret (1972), starring Liza Minnelli, was based on
this book, which on turn inspired Fred Ebb-John Kanders' Broadway
musical from John van Druten's play I am a Camera, filmed in 1955. Liza
Minnelli as Sally Bowles was in her first singing role. She won a Best
Actress Oscar, British Academy of Film and Television Arts award, and
Golden Globe for Best Actress. However, John Simon in the New Leader<i></i> (March 20, 1972) was not happy with her performance:<b> </b><b></b><b></b>"The
film's irredeemable disaster is its Sally Bowles: changing her into an
American was bad enough; into Liza Minnelli, catastrophe... Plain,
ludicrously rather than pathetically plain is what Miss Minnelli is.
That turnipy nose overhanging a forward-gaping mouth and hastily
retreating chin, that bulbous cranium with eyes as big (and as
inexpressive) as saucers." TV movie 1999, book: Joe Masteroff, play by
