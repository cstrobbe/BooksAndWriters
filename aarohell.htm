<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Poet, Ph.D. (in geology), pioneer of modernism
in literature in Finland. Hellaakoski showed new directions for poetry with his meters that differed from the norm. He published some twelve collections, but ceased writing poetry from the late 1920s to 1940, concentrating during those years to teaching and researching.

<P>Aaro Hellaakoski was born in Oulu, the first son of Antti Rietrikki Helaakoski, a geography teacher and 
later Ph.D., and Aina Maria (Lindman) Helaakoski. Because of his harelip, he was mocked by other children, 
and at home his relationship with his stern father was strained. Hellaakoski studied in Oulu and Turku. Upon 
graduting he moved to Helsinki, where he added one "l" to his name, thus it became 
Hellaakoski. In 1919 he received his M.A.from the University of Helsinki. At that time his 
relationship with his father had become better – they both loved nature and science, and he 
ofted visited his family, which had moved to Tampere. </P><P>After the conquest of Tampere during the Civil 
War (1917-18), Hellaakoski joined the White Army. He did not serve in the front but as a guard in a 
prison. The treatment of Red prisoners after the war shocked Hellaakoski. However, 
the poem 'Rajasuutari' in 
<EM>Me kaksi</EM>&nbsp;(1920, We two), about a Red cobbler executed by a firing squad, closes with the 
uncompromising words: "Se askel, se jyrkin, se kammottaahan: / 
Tilis tee! Yp&ouml;yksin&auml;s outoon maahan!" (That step, the steepest, it 
horrifies: / Make your will! Alone you go to the strange land!) </P>
<P>Hellaakoski was married to Lempi Aaltonen, a teacher, the sculptor W&auml;in&ouml; Aaltonen's sister. 
They had met in 1921 and Hellaakoski fell immediately in love with the beautiful, dark, intelligent woman. 
Hellaakoski gave her his new book, <EM>Elegiasta&nbsp;oodiin</EM> (1921,&nbsp;From elegy to ode), which included some strong 
love poems. In a poem from 1921, inspired by Lempi and 
starting with the words "You are mine," he wrote:<B><FONT size=2> </FONT></B>"Tuta 
saata: joku kest&auml;v&auml; voima / k&auml;y hy&ouml;kyen ylitses – / olet kaipuuni kummitsoima 
/ kunkin viekin askeles". Hellaakoski compared his passion to waves surging over her. Lempi 
Aaltonen first rejected Hellaakoski but eventually in 1924 she accepted his proposal. His temperament frightened her – "Sharp teeth and hard mouth / I 
have always had," Hellaakoski once wrote. The writer 
<A href="joell.htm">Joel Lehtonen</A> witnessed the wedding. According to a story, after the 
priest had asked "do you want...", Hellaakoski had answered "yes" so loud, 
that the priest took a few frightened steps backwards. </P>
<P>In Helsinki Hellaakoski associated with artists, the writer Viljo Kojo, and the young 
sculptor W&auml;in&ouml; Aaltonen, his a kindred spirit in his classical, pure expression. 
Aaltonen, who illustrated Hellaakoski's poems, mad in 1919 a bronze portrait of his friend. In 1938 
they traveld in Italy and Hellaakoski recorded his impression in the article 'Italia Bella'. </P>
<P>Hellaakoski's first collection of poems, <EM>Runoja</EM> (1916, Poems), satirized bourgeois mentality and 
empty merriments. The uneven collection received poor reviews – Eino Leino 
dismissed it as immature both in content and form – but it contained the poem 
'Conceptio artis', in which Hellaakoski formulated his esthetic principle: "Naked is how 
I want you, / unadorned unpainted, / by others' cheap / gifts untainted." 
<FONT size=2>(transl. by Keith Bosley) </FONT></P>
<P>In <EM>Nimett&ouml;mi&auml; lauluja</EM>&nbsp;(1918, Nameless songs) and <I>Me kaksi</I> satirical tones alternated 
with feelings on loneliness; the latter received a good review by Rafael Koskimies in 
the magazine <I>Aika</I>. The 1920s an intensely creative period for Hellaakoski, who also tried his hand at watercolors. 
He published three collections of poems, studies of the artists Tyko Sallinen and 
W&auml;in&ouml; Aaltonen, and a collection of short stories, <EM>Iloinen&nbsp;yll&auml;tys</EM>&nbsp;(1927).
 <A href="koskenni.htm">V.A. Koskenniemi</A>, the&nbsp;leading writer between the two world wars and the editor of <EM>Aika</EM>, admired Hellaakoski's work, seeing him as a kindred spirit. After Hellaakoski attacked Eero J&auml;rnefelt and Maila Talvio in an article published in <EM>Iltalehti</EM>, Koskenniemi labelled his&nbsp;work&nbsp;as a critic as literary hysteria, connected with stupidity and delusions of grandeur. 
</P><P>With <EM>J&auml;&auml;peili</EM> (1928, The ice mirror) Hellaakoski reached the highest point of his early period. Its innovative pictorial typography in 'Sade' and 'Dolce far niente' recalled Apollinaire's <I>Calligrammes</I> (1918). Other sources of inspiration were Cubism and the Italian poet F.T. Marinetti (1876-1944), writer of <I>Manifeste du futurisme</I><I></I> (1912). Hellaakoski's enthusiasm about urban visual landscape had also connections with the youthful macine romanticism of Mika Waltari and Olavi Paavolainen, whose collection of poems, <I>Valtatiet</I>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in the same year. However, Paavolainen's reaction to the work was negative. Hellaakoski's experimentation remained an unique effort until the 1960s. </P>
<P><I>J&auml;&auml;peili</I> included Hellaakoski's famous poem 'Hauen laulu' 
(The Song of a Pike): "Kosteasta kodostaan / nous hauki puuhun laulamaan /" (From his wet home / 
the pike climbed into a tree to sing). 
The poet considered it his best achievement; its imagery of creativity and inspiration 
has been a subject of many interpretations. Several poems, such as 'Uni' (dream), 'Vieras' (guest), 'Outo kieli' (strange language), and 'Tyranni' (tyrant), recorded intime moments from Hellaakoski's family life, his happiness and responsibility as a father. "Rakas silm&auml; ummistui, / hymyyn huuli unohtui. / Ken on, ken on vierell&auml;ni / hengitt&auml;in mun henke&auml;ni?"<FONT size=2><B> </B>(from 'Vieras') </FONT>After <I>J&auml;&auml;peili</I>, which sold poorly, he did not publish collections for over 12 years. Moreover, Viljo Tarkiainen did not mention his name in his history of Finland's literature&nbsp;from&nbsp;1936. </P>
<P>From 1925 to 1927 Hellaakoski worked as a teacher at a lyc&eacute;e (Helsingin suomalainen yhteislyseo), and then became a teacher at Helsingin suomalainen tytt&ouml;lyseo (later Tytt&ouml;normaalilyseo), working there until 1952. Hellaakoski received his Ph.D. in geology in 1929, and from 1930 to 1949 he was a lecturer at the University of Helsinki. In the 1930s Hellaakoski did not publish poetry, but concentrated on teaching and scientific work. His first new collection, the patriotic <EM>Vartiossa</EM> (1941, On guard) emerged from a spiritual crisis, which started his second creative period.&nbsp;Hellaakoski's angry reply to Koskenniemi's negative review in <EM>Valvoja-Aika</EM>&nbsp;was not published. </P><P>Before the Winter War (1939-40) Hellaakoski had thought that the edition of his selected poems would be a "gravestone for a living body," but the war broke his mental dams. He read Fr&ouml;ding, Rilke, Goethe, and Verlaine and felt that he still had someting to say as a poet. <EM>Uusi runo</EM>&nbsp;(1943) – the title meaning "new poem" – was written during the Continuation War at nights. Major works from this later period include <EM>Huojuvat keulat</EM>&nbsp;(1946, The swaying prows) and <EM>Sarjoja</EM> (1952, Suites), a cycle of alternating long and short verses about nature and travellers there. </P>
<P>After the war, Hellaakoski joined the leftist Kiila (wedge) group, but remained critical and independent on its politics. Koskenniemi, who had supported the German cause and whose anti-Communist stand was well-known, called him as a turncoat opportunist. Kiila was founded in the 1930s. Its members, such as Viljo Kajava and Arvo Turtiainen, favored free verse and were more or less Marxist. For a period,&nbsp;Hellaakoski served as chief editor of the literary periodical <I>N&auml;k&ouml;ala</I>, founded in 1949. Hellaakoski died of cancer on November 23, 1952 in Helsinki. By an accident his novel manuscript <I>Raskas-Matti </I>was burned with his own selection of disposable writings.</P>

<P>As a poet Hellaakoski was a visionary. He strove for a personal, powerful poetry, while also seeking spiritual expression. Hellaakoski's first period is characterized by revolt against empty traditions and an assault on the bourgeoisie conformity; in his latter period the poet found his inspiration in the pantheistic acceptance of the unity of man and the world. But for a former image breaker resignation was not easily:<FONT size=2><B> </B></FONT>"Kapinoinut ja kiistellyt / olenhan. Siin&auml; on syyni. / On niin vaikea olla nyt / alistuvainen ja tyyni."<FONT size=2> (from 'Suolaa' in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Hiljaisuus</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1949) </FONT>Human aspirations Hellaakoski set against long natural cycles, explaining in his essay <I>Runon historiaa</I> (1964, A history of poetry) that as a geologist he was used to measure time in millions of years. "Enh&auml;n geologina osaa katsoa nykyhetke&auml; ylen likin&auml;k&ouml;isesti; joskohta aikayksikk&ouml;ni pyrkiv&auml;t v&auml;kisin olemaan kymmeni&auml;tuhansia ja miljoonia vuosia. Viisaimmilla vasemmistolaisilla v&auml;l&auml;ht&auml;&auml; joskus samallaisia mittalukuja, ja silloin me ny&ouml;k&auml;yt&auml;mme toisillemme." <FONT size=2>(from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Runon historiaa</FONT></I><FONT size=2>; written in 1946-47) </FONT>In the background of several of his poems was the nature of Taipalsaari, where he spent his summers. </P>
<P>Besides poems and geographical papers, Hellaakoski 
published essays, short stories and aphorisms. He was an amateur painter, but destroyed most of his works, sparing only some watercolors. Between 1921 and 1923 he made some thirty watercolor paintings. Hellaakoski was familiar with Expressionism, Cubism,
and theories of <I>Futurism</I>, which also influenced his literary work. <EM>Niinkuin min&auml; n&auml;in</EM>&nbsp;(1959, The way I saw it) was Hellaakoski's biography of the expressionist artist Tyko Sallinen. </P>
