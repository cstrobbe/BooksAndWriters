<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French writer, satirist, the
embodiment of the 18th-century Enlightenment. Voltaire is remembered as
a crusader against tyranny and bigotry. Compared to Rousseau's
(1712-1778) rebelliousness and idealism, Voltaire's world view was more
skeptical, but both of their ideas influenced deeply the French
Revolution. Voltaire disliked Rousseau and wrote to him in 1761: "One
feels like crawling on all fours after reading your work." <font size="2"></font></p>
<blockquote><i><font size="2">"</font></i><b><font size="2">Liberty of thought is the life of the soul."</font></b><font size="2"> (from <i>Essay on Epic Poetry</i>, 17</font><font size="2">27) </font><font size="2"></font>

</blockquote>
<p>François-Marie Arouet de Voltaire was born in Paris into a middle-class family. 
His father was a minor treasury official. Voltaire was educated 
by the Jesuits at the Collège Louis-le-Grand (1704-11). He learned Latin and Greek and 
later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish and English. From 1711 to 1713 
he studied law. Before devoting himself entirely to writing, Voltaire worked as a 
secretary to the French ambassador
in Holland. From the beginning, Voltaire had troubles with the authorities, but he energetically 
attacked the government and the Catholic church. These activities led to numerous imprisonments 
and exiles. In his early twenties he spent eleven months in the Bastille for writing satiric verses 
about the aristocracy. </p>
<p>Voltaire did not support the dogmatic theology of institutional religions, his religiosity 
was anticlerical. With his brother Armand, who was a fundamentalist Catholic, Voltaire 
did not get on as well as with his sister. 

Atheism Voltaire considered not as baleful as fanaticism, but nearly always fatal to virtue. 
The doctrines about the Trinity or the Incarnation he dismissed as nonsense. 
As a humanist, Voltaire advocated religious and social tolerance, but not necessarily 
in a direct way. Well known is Voltaire's hostility toward the Jews. 
His play&nbsp;<span class="ft"><em>Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le prophéte</em> </span>(1741), 
which portrayed the founder of Islam 
as an intriguer and greedy for power, was 
denounced by Catholic clergymen. They had no doubts that
the true target was Christian fanaticism. However, Pope Benedict XIV, whom Voltaire 
dedicated the work, replied by saying that he read it with great pleasure. 
 </p>

<p>In 1716 Voltaire was arrested and exiled from Paris for five months.
From 1717 to 1718 he was imprisoned in the Bastille for lampoons of the Regency. 
During this time he wrote the tragedy <em>&#338;dipe</em>, and started to use the name Voltaire. 
The play brought him fame which did not lessen the number of his enemies at court. </p>

<p>At his 1726 stay at the Bastille, Voltaire was visited by a flow of
admirers. Between 1726 and 1729 he lived in exile mainly in England.
There he avoided trouble for three years and wrote in English his first
essays, <em>Esssay upon Epic Poetry</em>&nbsp;and <em>Essay upon the Civil Wars in France</em>,
which were published in 1727. After returning to France Voltaire wrote
plays, poetry, historical and scientific treatises and became royal
historiographer. <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>L'Histoire de Charles XII</em><strong> </strong></span></span>(1731) used novelistic technique and rejected the idea that divine intervention guides history. In 1734 appeared Voltaire's <i>Philosophical Letters </i>in
which he compared the French system of government with the system he
had seen in England. Voltaire stated that he had perceived fewer
barriers between occupations in England than in his own country. The
book was banned, and Voltaire was forced to flee Paris. The English
edition became a bestseller outside France. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In general, the art of government
consists in taking as much money as possible from one class of citizens
to give to the other."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Dictionnaire Philosophique</font></i><font size="2">, 1764) </font></blockquote>
<p>Voltaire's economic situation improved substantially, when he joined a syndicate, which made a large
profit with the state lottery. In addition, with lucky speculation in the Compagnie des Indes 
he became so wealthy, that he lent money to dukes and princes.</p>
 

<p>At the age of thirty-nine, Voltraire started his famous sixteen-year 
liaison with&nbsp;Émilie du Châtelet. She was twenty-seven, married, and the mother 
of three children. "I found, in 1733, a young woman who thought as I did," 
Voltaire wrote in his memoirs, "and who decided to spend several years in the 
country, cultivating her mind." Voltaire's rival was the <em>philosophe</em>
scientist Pierre-Louis Moreau de Malpertuis. Moreover,&nbsp;he suffered
from digestive problems and attacks of diarrhea, and was often stopped
from having sex with her. </p><p>The Marquis du Châtelet was well aware of 
the affair, and sometimes visited his wife&nbsp;and her lover at the Château de Cirey, where the couple&nbsp;lived&nbsp;
in 1734-36 and 1737-40. Between the years Voltaire took a refuge in Holland (1736-37). Under the tutelage of 
Mme du Châtelet, a mathematician and 
scientist, Voltaire assimilated the principles of physics and was able to write <em>Eléments de la philosophie de Newton,</em>
which was dedicated to her. Voltaire nicknamed&nbsp; madame du
Châtelet&nbsp;"Mme Neuton Pompom." She died in September 1749, a few
days after giving birth to a baby girl. The infant died&nbsp;a few days
later.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mme du Châtelet's translation and commentary
on&nbsp;Newton's <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, which was her last great work,&nbsp;came out in 1759. </p>


<p>In 1740 Voltaire was an ambassador-spy in Prussia, then in Brussels
(1742-43), and in 1748 he was at the court of King Stanislas in
Lunéville. From 1745 to 1750 he was a historiographer to Louis XV and
in 1746 he was elected to the French Academy. In Paris, Voltaire had a
new mistress, Marie-Louise Denis, his eldest niece. At the invitation
of Fredrick the Great, Voltaire moved in 1750 to Berlin, realizing
eventually that the ruler was more enlightened in theory than in
practice. Frederick cut down his allowance of sugar and chocolate and
Voltaire said that the king never showed gratitude to any creature
other than the horse on which he fled from the Battle of Mollwitz. </p>

<p>Voltaire settled in 1755 in 1755 in Switzerland, where he lived the
rest of his life, apart from trips to France. He had his own château,
Les Delices, outside Geneva, and later at nearby Ferney, in France.
Anybody of note, from Boswell to Casanova, wanted to visit the place;
Voltaire's conversations with visitors were recorded and published and
he was flattered by kings and nobility. "Common sense is not so
common," Voltaire wrote. </p>
<p>Voltaire's official publishers were Gabriel and Philibert Cramer
from Geneve. They operated from Stockholm to Naples, and from Venice to
Lisbon and Paris, spreading the ideas of Enlightenment. As an essayist
Voltaire defended freedom of speech and religious tolerance. In his<em> Dictionnaire philosophique</em>
(1764) he defined the ideal religion &#8211; it would teach very little dogma
but much morality. Voltaire's thoughts were condemned in Paris,
Geneva, and Amsterdam. For safety reasons Voltaire denied his
authorship.</p>
<p>In his late years Voltaire produced several anti-religious writing.
In Ferney he built a chapel with the inscription 'Deo Erexit Voltaire'
inscribed on the lintel. He also led campaign to open up a trial, in
which the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas was found guilty of murdering
his eldest son and executed. The parliament at Paris declared
afterwards in 1765 Calas and all his family innocent. <font size="2">(See also the writer </font><a href="../../../ezola.htm"><font size="2">Emile Zola</font></a><font size="2">, who defended falsely accused Alfred Dreyfus in his open letter </font><i><font size="2">J'accuse</font></i><font size="2"> in 1898.)</font></p>


<p>Voltaire died in Paris on May 30, 1778, as the undisputed leader of
the Age of Enlightenment. He had suffered throughout his life from poor
health, but at the time of his death he was eighty-four. Because he was
excommunicated at the time, he had risked becoming a a vampire by the
rules of folklore. During the Frech Revolution, his coffin was
installed in the Panthéon in Paris. In the 1830s, when the Panthéon
served as a church again, it was rumored that his remains had been
dumped in a sewer. When the tomb was opened in 1897, it was reported
that "A viscous matter, apparently coagulated sawdust" coated
Voltaire's remains. His skull had been sawed in half when his brain was
removed soon after his death. Voltaire's sardonic smirk was still
recognizable. <br>
</p>
      <p>Voltaire left behind him over fourteen thousand known letters
and over two thousand books and pamphlets. Among his best-known works
is the satirical short story&nbsp;<em>Candide</em> (1759), which reflected the 
nihilism of <a href="../../../jswift.htm">Jonathan Swift</a>. In the
story the young and innocent hero, 
Candide, experiences a long series of misfortunes and disastrous 
adventures. He is kicked out of the castle of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh for making 
love to the baron's daughter, Cunégonde, in the army he is beaten nearly 
to death, in Lisbon he experiences the famous earthquake, he is hunted by the 
Inquisition and Jesuits, and threatened with imprisonment in Paris. 
Meanwhile Cunégonde's father, mother and brother are hacked to 
pieces by invaders, and she is raped repeatedly. Eventually Candide 
marries Cunégonde, who has become an ugly gummy-eyed, flat-chested 
washerwoman, with wrinkled cheeks."If this is the best of possible 
worlds," Voltaire wrote, "what then are the others." 
Finally Candide finds the pleasures of cultivating 
one's garden&nbsp;&#8211; "Il faut cultiver notre jardin." </p>

<p><i>Candide</i>'s world is full of liars, traitors, ingrates, thieves, 
misers, killers, fanatics, hypocrites, fools and so on. However, Voltaire's 
outrage is not based on social criticism but on his ironic view of human nature. 
When Candide asks his friend Martin, does he believe that men have always 
massacred one another, Martin points out that hawks eat pigeons. " &#8211; Well, 
said Martin, if hawks have always had the same character, why do you suppose that 
men have changed?" Candide rejects the philosophy of his tutor, the 
unsuccessfully hanged Doctor Pangloss, who claims that "all is for the 
best in this best of all possible 
worlds"<font size="2"> (see </font><a href="../../../leibnitz.htm"><font size="2">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</font></a><font size="2">)</font>.
<i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Candide </i>was partly inspired by the devastating Lisbon earthquake 
of 1755, Dr. Pangloss was allegedly a caricature of Leibniz, but it is
possible that the real model was Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698-1759),
a French philosopher and scientist. The prolific writer produced a number of studies
from the physics of Venus to the proof of the existence of God. 
Voltaire's<em> </em><span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Histoire du docteur Akakia et du natif de Saint-Malo</em><strong> </strong></span></span>(1753)
openly ridiculed Maupertuis' ideas. In 1821, Voltaire's novel was among
the works which Eteinne Antoine, bishop of Troyne, condemned as godless
and sacrilegius Pope Pius VII place Candide on the list of prohibited
books. The United States Customs seized a shipment of the imported
edition of the novel in 1928 and declared it obscene. <i>Candide's</i> narrative frame, the education of a young man, was again 
utilized among others in <a href="../../../stendhal.htm">Stendhal</a>'s <i>The Red and the 
Black</i> and <a href="../../../tmann.htm">Thomas Mann</a>'s <i>The Magic 
Mountain</i>. Leonard Bernstein 
made <i>Candide</i>
a musical comedy which opened in Boston in 1956 with mixed reviews.
Lillian Hellman, who wrote the libretto, who had never before worked on
a musical. Hellman drew a parallel between Candide's blind faith in Dr.
Palgloss and the paranoia of the McCarthy era of the 1950s. "Three of
the most talented people of our Theater possesses&#8211; Lillian Hellman, Leonard Bernstein and Tyrone Guthrie &#8211; have joined hands transforming Voltaire's Candide into a really spectacular disaster," said Walter Kerr in his  <span style="font-style: italic;">Herald Tribune</span> review. <br>
 </p>

<p>In addition to <i>Candide</i>, Voltaire treated the problem of 
evil 
 in his classic tale <em>Zadig</em> (1747), set in the ancient 
Babylon, and in 'Poem of the Lisbon' Earthquake'. "But how 
conceive a God supremely good," Voltaire asked in the 
poem, "Who heaps his favours on the sons he loves, / Yet scatters 
evil with as large a hand?" <em>Micromégas </em>(1752) was an early 
science-fiction story, in which two ambassadors from the outer space 
visit Earth, and witness follies of human thought and behavior. 
Voltaire possibly wrote the <i>conte</i> already in 1738-39. It 
has similarities
 with 'Voyage du Baron Gangan', which he sent to
Fredrick the Great. 
</p>
<p>
Voltaire's<i> Dictionnaire Philosophique</i> was burned with the
young Chevalier de la Barre, who had neglected to take of his hat while
passing a bridge, where a sacred statue was exposed. Later Voltaire
introduced his <i>Dictionary</i> as a dialogical book: its 
short, polemical articles were more useful when "the readers produce the 
other half". In <i>Essay on the Manner and Spirit of Nations,</i> Voltaire 
presented the first modern comparative history of civilizations, including 
Asia. Later he returned to the Chinese philosophy is his <i>Dictionary</i>,
praising the teachings of Confucius: "What more beautiful rule of
conduct has ever been given man since the world began? Let us admit
that there has been no legislator more useful to the human race."
Voltaire regarded China as a "most tolerant and receptive nation" and
also asserted that the organization of Chinese empire is in truth the
best that the world has ever seen.<br>
