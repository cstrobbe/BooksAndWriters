<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French novelist of the realist school, best-known for&nbsp;<em>Madame Bovary</em>&nbsp;(1857), a 
story of adultery and unhappy love affair of the provincial wife Emma Bovary. As a writer Flaubert was a 
perfectionist, who did not make a distinction between a beautiful or ugly subject: all was in the style. 
The idea, he argued, only exists by virtue of its form &#8211; its elements included the perfect word, 
cunningly contrived and verified rhythms, and a genuine architectural structure. <i>Madame Bovary</i> was 
first translated into English by Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor Marx. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Has it ever happened to you," Leon went
on, "to come across some vague idea of one's own in a book, some dim
image that comes back to you from afar, and as the completest
expression of your own slightest sentiment?"</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">"I have experienced it," she replied.</font><br>
<font size="2">"That is why," he said, "I especially love the poets. I
think verse more tender than prose, and that it moves far more easily
to tears."</font></b><font size="2"> (from <i>Madame Bovary</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Gustave Flaubert was born in Rouen into a family of doctors. His
father, Achille-Cléophas Flaubert, a chief surgeon at the Rouen
municipal hospital, made money investing in land. Flaubert's mother,
Anne-Justine-Caroline (née Fleuriot), was the daughter of a physician;
she became the most important person in the author's life.
Anne-Justine-Caroline died in 1872. </p>
<p>Flaubert began to write during his school years. At the age of
fifteen he won a prize for an essay on mushrooms. Actually the work was
a copy. His first published short story was 'Bibliomanie' (1837), which
appeared in the pink pages of a Rouen literary journal called <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Colibri</span>.
This stylistic exercise in Hoffmannian fantasy about a bookseller's
fetishist love of books drew its inspiration from a fabricated trial
account published in <span style="font-style: italic;">La Gazette des Tribunaux</span>.
The case concerned a former Catalonian monk, a bibliophile who became a
serial killer over the possession of rare books. He was found guilty
and executed. <br>
</p>
      <p>A disappointment in his teens &#8211; Flaubert fell in love with
Elisa Schlésinger, who was married and some 10 years his senior &#8211;
inspired much of his early writing. His bourgeois background Flaubert
found early burdensome, and eventually his rebel against it led to his
expulsion from school. Flaubert completed his education privately in
Paris. </p>

<p>In the 1840s Flaubert studied law at Paris, a brief episode in his
life, and in 1844 he had a nervous attack. "I was cowardly in my
youth," Flaubert wrote once to George Sand. "I was afraid of life." He
recognized from suffering a nervous disease, although it could have
been epilepsy. However, the diagnosis changed Flaubert's life. He
failed his law exams and decided to devote himself to literature. In
this Flaubert was helped by his father who bought him a house at
Croisset, on the River Seine between Paris and Rouen. </p>
<p>In 1846 Flaubert met the writer Louise Colet. They corresponded
regularly and she became Flaubert's mistress although they met
infrequently. Colet gave in <i>Lui </i>(1859) her account of their
relationship. After the death of both his father and his married
sister, Flaubert moved at Croisset, the family's country home near
Rouen. Until he was 50 years old, Flaubert lived with his mother &#8211; he
was called ''hermit of Croisset.'' The household also included his
niece Caroline. His maxim was: "Be regular and orderly in your life
like a bourgeois, so that you may be violent and original in your
work." </p>
<p>Although Flaubert once stated ''I am a bear and want to remain a
bear in my den,'' he kept good contacts to Paris and witnessed the
Revolution of 1848. Later he received honors from Napoleon III. From
1856 Flaubert spent winters in Paris. He had written since childhood,
and unable to throw anything away, he stored his manuscripts. But by
the age of thirty, his only major work was a prose-poem, <em>La Tentation de Saint&nbsp; Antoine. </em>Part of its fantastic mode was inspired by a Brueghel painting.
His friend, Louis Bouilhet, adviced, "I think you ought to throw it in
the fire and never mention it again." In 1871, when the Prussian army
destroyed the last monarchical regime in France, Flaubert buried a box
full of letters and perhaps other papers in his garden. <br>
 </p>
<p>Flaubert's relationship with Collet ended in 1855. From November
1849 to April 1851 he travelled with the writer Maxime du Camp in North
Africa, Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Italy. It took several Egyptian
guides to help Flaubert to the top of the Great Pyramid &#8211; the muscular,
almost six feet tall author was at that time actually relatively fat.
"Handsome heads, ugly feet" was his comment upon the Colossi of Abu
Simbel. Du Camp made the first known photographs of these sandstone
figures. <br>
</p>
      <p>On his return Flaubert started <i>Madame Bovary</i>, which took five years to complete. Sometimes he spent a week on one paragraph. It appeared first in the <i>Revue</i>
(1856) and in book form next year. The realistic depiction of adultery
was condemned as offensive to morality and religion. In one cartoon
Flaubert was portrayed as a surgeon, wearing a blood-stained apron and
holding up the heart of Emma Bovary. Flaubert was prosecuted, though he
escaped conviction, which was not a common result during the official
censorship of the Second Empire. When Baudelaire's provocative
collection of verse, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i>, was brought before the same judge, Baudelaire was fined and 6 of the 100 poems were suppressed. </p>

<p><i>Madame Bovary </i>was published in two volumes in 1857, but it appeared originally in the <i>Revue de Paris</i>,
1856-57. Emma Bovary is married to Charles Bovary, a physician. As a
girl Emma has read Walter Scott, she has romantic dreams and longs for
adventure. "What exasperated her was that Charles did not seem to
notice her anguish. His conviction that he was making her happy seemed
to her an imbecile insult, and his sureness on this point ingratitude.
For whose sake, then was she virtuous? Was it not for him, the obstacle
to all felicity, the cause of all misery, and, as it were, the sharp
clasp of that complex strap that bucked her in on all sides." Emma
seeks release from the boredom of her marriage from love affairs with
two men &#8211; with the lawyer Léon Dupuis and then with Rodolphe Boulanger.
Emma wants to leave her husband with him. He rejects the idea and Emma
becomes ill. After she has recovered, she starts again her relationship
with Léon, who works now in Rouen. They meet regularly at a hotel. Emma
is in heavy debts because of her lifestyle and she poisons herself with
arsenic. Charles Bovary dies soon after her and their daughter Berthe
is taken care of poor relatives. Berthe starts to earn her living by
working in a factory. The character of Emma was important to the author
&#8211; society offered her no escape and once Flaubert said: "Emma, c'est
moi."<b></b> Delphine Delamare, who died in 1848, is alleged to have been the original of Emma Bovary. </p>
<p>Eleanor Marx's translation of <i>Madame Bivary</i> appeared in the same year in which the first volume of <i>Das Kapital</i> was 
published in English. She committed suicide in 1898 by taking cyanide poison after learning that her 
common law husband Dr Edward Aveling had 
entered into a legal marriage with a young actress. Aveling, who had purchased the poison, 
inherited Eleanor Marx's fortune, including revenues from the translation.</p>
<p>In the 1860s Flaubert enjoyed success as a writer and intellectual
at the court of Napoleon III. Among his friends were Zola, George Sand,
Hippolyte Taine, and the Russian writer Turgenev, with whom he shared
similar aesthetic ideals &#8211; dedication to realism, and to the
nonjudgmental representation of life. Their complete correspondence was
published in English in 1985. ''The thought that I shall see you this
winter quite at leisure delights me like the promise of an oasis," he
wrote to Turgenev. "The comparison is the right one, if only you knew
how isolated I am! Who is there to talk to now? Who is there in our
wretched country who still 'cares about literature'? Perhaps one single
man? Me! The wreckage of a lost world, an old fossil of romanticism!
You will revive me, you'll do me good.''<font size="2"> </font><font size="2">(</font><font size="2">from <i>Flaubert &amp; Turgenev. A Friendship in Letters</i>, edited and translated by Barbara Beaumont, 1985) </font></p>
<p>Flaubert was by nature melancholic. His perfectionism, long hours at
his work table with a frog inkwell, only made his life harder. In a
letter to Ernest Feydeau he wrote: "Books are made not like children
but like pyramids... and are just as useless!" Flaubert's other,
non-literary life was marked by his prodigious appetite for
prostitutes, which occasionally led to venereal infections. "It may be
a perverted taste," Flaubert said, "but I love prostitution, and for
itself, too, quite apart from its carnal aspects." His last years were
shadowed by financial worries &#8211; he helped with his modest fortune his
niece's family after their bankruptcy. Flaubert died of a cerebral
hemorrhage on May 8, in 1880. </p>
<p>In the 1870s Flaubert's work gained acclaim by the new school of
naturalistic writers. His narrative approach, that the novelist should
not judge, teach, or explain but remain neutral, was widely adopted.
Flaubert himself detested the label Realist &#8211; and other labels. Among
Flaubert's later major works is&nbsp;<em>Salammbô </em>(1862), a story
of the siege of Carthage in 240-237 BC by mercenaries. The novel
inspired in 1998 Philippe Fénélon's opera, the libretto was written by
Jean-Yves Masson. Also the composers Berlioz and Mussorgsky had planned
opera adaptations, but they were never realized. In Orson Welles's film <span style="font-style: italic;">Citizen Kane</span> (1941) Charles Foster Kane produces an opera for his former mistress and second wife, Susan Alexander, based on <span style="font-style: italic;">Salammbô</span>. Bernard Herrmann, who wrote the score, proclaimed in 1972 that "I was fortunate enough to start my career with a film like <span style="font-style: italic;">Citizen Kane</span>. It's been a downhill run ever since!"<em> <br>
</em></p>
<p><em>Trois contes</em>
(1872) was a collection of three tales. The Italian writer Italo
Calvino has praised it as "one of the most extraordinary spiritual
journeys ever accomplished outside any religion."<em> L'Éducation sentimentale</em> (1869, A Sentimental Education),&nbsp; a panorama of France, was set in the era of the Revolution of 1848. Its first version <em>(<span class="st">La première Education Sentimentale</span></em>)
Flaubert had finished in 1845. The story depicted the relationship
between a young man and an older married woman. Fréderic Moreau, the
hero, is a gifted young man, full of vague longings, but he constantly
meets people who have nothing else to offer but pessimism and cynicism.
The ironic title, <i>A Sentimental Education</i>, means the education of feeling, and refers to the failure of Flaubert's generation to achieve its ideals. <em><br>
</em></p>
      <p><em>La Tentation de Saint Antoine</em> (1874, The Temptation of Saint Anthony), written between 1848 and 1874,
influenced the young Freud. Its story was based on the story of the
4th-century Christian anchorite, who lived in the Egyptian desert and
experienced philosophical and physical temptations. There were other
writings, novels, and unfinished projects, but this wasthe work on which Flaubert spent most of his time.  </p>

<p>Flaubert's book on bourgeois stupidity, <em>Bouvard et Pécuchet</em>, was left unfinished at his death, and was first published in <i>La Nouvelle Revue </i>(1880-81),
edited by Flaubert's niece Caroline Commanville. The two protagonists,
two copy clerks who move to the country, have often been considered
forefathers of Beckett's characters. <i>Bouvard and Pécuchet</i> was partly inspired by Bartlémy Maurice's story '<i>Les Deux greffiers</i>' (1841), which had appeared in the magazine <i>La Gazette fdes tribunnaux.</i> Some of the banalities which Flaubert found unbearable, he had already collected in <i>Dictionary of Received Ideas</i> (1911). </p>
