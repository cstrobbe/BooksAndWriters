<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American literary critic, journalist, and
essayist, who wrote &#8211; according to some estimations &#8211; 3 000 newspaper
columns. During the 15-year period following World War I, Mencken set
the standard for satire in his day. Mencken's <span style="font-style: italic;">Prejudices</span> (1919-1927) is a
treasure for all interested in exuberant prose. His essays are still
widely read and cherished.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Here is something that the
psychologists have so far neglected: the love of ugliness for its own
sake, the lust to make the world intolerable. Its habitat is the United
States. Out of the melting pot emerges a race which hates beauty as it
hates truth."</b> (from 'The Libido for the Ugly,' 1927)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Henry Louis Mencken was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His
grandfather had prospered in the tobacco business and his father,
August, continued the family tradition. Mencken studied at the
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (1892-96) and then worked at his
father's cigar factory. After his father died in 1899, Mencken was free
to choose his own trade in the world. "I chose newspaper work without
any hesitation whatever, and save when the scent of a passing
garbage-cart has revived my chemical libido, I have never regretted my
choice," he once said. He was a reporter or editor for several
Baltimore papers, among them <i>Baltimore Morning Herald</i>. Later he
joined the staff of the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, for which he worked
throughout most of his life. From 1916 to 1918 he was a war
correspondent in Germany and in Russia. </p>
      <p>Although Mencken published a collection of poems in 1903, he
considred <span style="font-style: italic;">George Bernard Shaw: His
Plays</span> (1905) his "first real book". Mencken's study on the
philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche (1908) was partly inspired by his own
bourgeois German background. Upon the publication of the book, Mencken
was charged being an intimate associate and agent of "the German
monster, Nietzsky," as it was said in the official report. Mencken also
taught himself German well enough to translate Nietzsche's <i>Anti-Christ</i>,
which appeared in 1920. With Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx he
shared a similar view on the role of religion in society &#8211; it was an
tool for manipulating credulous masses, but his personal philosophy is
very close to that of Schopenhauer: "To read the thoughts of others is
like taking the remains of someone else's meal, like putting on the
discarded clothes of a stranger." </p>
      <p>During World War I Mencken was pro-German, and his <span style="font-style: italic;">A Book of Prefaces </span>(1917) was
attacked by Stuart Sherman and others, who considered him unpatriotic.
From 1914 to 1923 Mencken coedited with drama critic George Jean Nathan
(1882-1958)<i> </i>the<i> Smart Set</i>, which mocked everything from
politics to art, universities to the Bible, and beginning from 'The
Sahara of the Bozart' (November 1917), it took as its target the
culture of the South. With Nathan he cofounded <i>Parisienne</i>, <i>Saucy
Stories</i>, and <i>Black Mask</i> pulp magazines in the late 1910s,
and cofounded and edited <i>American Mercury</i> (1923-33). When
Mencken became really interested in the city councils and the state
legislatures and the Federal Congress, Nathan was appalled and left the
      <i>Mercury</i>. They were never more than friendly enemies. In
1919 Mencken published <span style="font-style: italic;">The American
Language</span>, a guide to American expressions and idioms, which was
a critical and popular success. It grew in the following years with
each reissue and have had several supplements. In 1917 Mencken started
as a literary adviser at Knopf publishers. From the mid-1920s his work
became increasingly political, and soon Mencken gained his nationwide
fame the reigning critic of manners and politics. </p>
      <p>Mencken was one of the most influential American critics in
the 1920s. He helped such newcomers as <a href="dreiser.htm">Theodore
Dreiser
      </a>and <a href="slewis.htm">Sinclair Lewis</a>. In general, he
preferred realism over high- flown idealism and modernism. He loved <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i> and Conrad's<i> Lord Jim</i>. As an editor he published
manuscripts by such young writers as Eugene O'Neill and Dorothy Parker,
and was the friend and mentor of<a href="jmcain"> James M. Cain</a>.
Mencken reviewed major works of Upton Sinclair, Henry James and <a href="fsfitzg.htm">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, whose first published
story appeared in the <i>Smart Set</i>. Mencken contributed to <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> (1924-28), <i>New York American</i> (1934-35), and the <i>Nation</i>
(1931-32). He was a columnist in <i>Evening Mail</i> in New York
(1917-18), and "The Free Lance" in <i>Sunpapers</i> (1919-41) in
Baltimore. When Rudolph Valentino was slandered in an unsigned
editorial headed 'Pink Powder Puff' in the Chicago<i> Tribune</i> (July
18, 1926), the great lover of the screen challenged the unknown
journalist to a boxing or a wrestling match, and Mencken was chosen to
play the part of the sage. He told that the actor should ignore the
taunt &#8211; "Let the dreadful farce roll along to exhaustion." Soon after
Valentino's death in August 1926, Mencken wrote of their meeting for the<i>
Baltimore Evening Sun</i>. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The charm of journalism, to many
of its practitioners, lies in the contacts it gives them with the
powerful and eminent. They enjoy communion with men of wealth, high
officers of state, and other such magnificoes. The delights of that
privilege are surely not to be cried down, but it seems to me that I
got a great deal more fun, in my days on the street, out of the lesser
personages who made up the gaudy life of the city. A mayor was
thrilling once or twice, but after that he tended to become a stuffed
shirt, speaking platitudes out of a tin throat."</b></font> <font size="2">(from 'Reflections on Journalism' in </font><i><font size="2">Twentieth-Century
Essays</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Ian Hamilton, 1999) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1930 Mencken married the writer and professor of English
Sara Haardt, who was eighteen years his junior and seriously ill. After
years of attacking the authority of the Bible and the church, he was
married in the Episcopal Church. Before proposing he had courted Haardt
for seven years, but during this period he had also continued his
relationship with Marion Bloom, a country girl from Maryland, and had
an affair Aileen Pringle, a quick-witted silent-movie star. "A very
amusing movie gal," Mencken said of her. Pringle married in 1944 James
M. Cain; they divorced within two years. Sara Haardt died of
tuberculosis in 1935. </p>
      <p>Mencken abandoned in 1938 his famous <i>Evening Sun </i>Monday
articles, and at the beginning of World War II he gave up writing
regularly for the <i>Sun</i>. Mencken's autobiographical trilogy began
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Happy Days</span> (1940), and
was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Newspaper Days</span>
(1941), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Heathen Days</span>
(1943). The last volume, <span style="font-style: italic;">My Life as
Author and Editor </span>(1993), appeared posthumously. Mencken
suffered in 1949 a stroke which impaired his speech. He was also unable
to read and write and did not remember the names of his friends.
Mencken died of heart failure on January 29, 1956 in Baltimore, in the
row house on Hollins Street where he had lived most of his life. In <i>Minority
Report</i> (1956) he had written: "The imbeciles who have printed acres
of comment on my books have seldom noticed the chief character of my
style. It is that I write almost scientific precision &#8211; that my meaning
is never obscure. The ignorant have often complained that my vocabulary
is beyond them, but that is imply because my ideas cover a wider range
that theirs do. Once they have consulted the dictionary they always
know exactly what I intend to say." </p>
      <p>In his essays Mencken, who was in "permanent opposition",
attacked on all aspects of American life, private and communal folly,
the daily panorama of human existence, saving nothing, but he had an
immense authority for a time. And he was always cocksure about
everything. "I have fixed and invariable ideas. They have not changed
since I was four or five years," he once stated. He called immigrant
ethnic groups uncivilized and out of touch with their own national
culture, criticized the influence of the British, questioning whether
intellectual life would exist at all in the U.S. were it not imported
from abroad, assaulted the style of Thorstein Veblen, and mocked
American education, literature ("thin and watery"), and such political
figures as Woodrow Wilson (a "pedagogue gone mashugga") and Calvin
Coolidge, whose intelligence is compared to that of a "cast-iron lawn
dog". Upon hearing of the death of Calvin Coolidge, he launched the
often-repeated line 'How can they be sure?' "Moronia" was the name he
sometimes used for the country he lived in.</p>
