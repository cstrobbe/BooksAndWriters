<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Short story writer and playwright who was a
correspondent of the Red Army forces of Semyon Budyonny during the
Russian civil war. Babel's fame is based on his stories of the Jews in
Odessa and his novel <i>Red Cavalry</i> (1926). He was the first major
Russian Jewish writer to write in Russian. </p>

Books and the People Who Read Them</font></i><font size="2"> by Elif

      <p>Isaak Babel was born in the Jewish ghetto of Odessa, Ukraine.
Most of his early years he spent in the Black Sea port Nikolaev, 90
miles away. At a time when most Jews were forbidden to live in Moscow,
St. Petersburg, Kiev, and other localities, Odessa had many times more
Jews than any other city in the Russian part of the empire. However,
between 1881 and 1917 two million Jews left Russia, mostly for America.
Babel's childhood was relatively comfortable, though he witnessed
pogroms in Southern Russia in 1905. However, his family was untouched.
His father was a successful businessman who installed his family in one
of the best streets in Odessa. Babel studied violin, German, French,
and Talmud at the Nicholas I Commercial Institute (1905-11) and wrote
stories at the age of fifteen in imitation of Guy de Maupassant. In
1915 Babel graduated from Kiev University, which had been evacuated to
Saratov on the Volga because of the war. </p>
      <p>After graduating Babel moved to St. Petersburg, where he
studied literature. In that capital city "traitors, malcontents,
whiners, and Jews" were banned and Babel had to use an apocryphal
passport. Two of Babel's stories were published in 1916 in <i>Letopis</i>, a
monthly edited by <a href="gorki.htm">Maksim Gorky</a>.
One described an abortion, in the other an Odessa Jew spends the night
with a prostitute to evade the police. These pieces were indicated as
obscene, but the courthouse was burned down by revolutionaries, and the
records were destroyed. <br>
</p>
      <p>Although Babel
himself had been untouched during the pogroms that spread throughout
Russia in 1905, he saw in rising revolutionary movements a promise of
freedom, and end of all persecution. Babel's satires attracted the
attention of the government. The short story 'V shchelochu' (The Bathroom Window) got him charged with pornography in 1917 but due to the political turmoil there never was a trial. The reworked version, published in 1923 with the subtitle "From the Book Oforty," contained a scene of voyerism. <br>
</p>
      <p>On Gorky's advice Babel decided to see the world and learn
about life. He participated briefly in the war on the Romanian front.
He was injured and after discharge Babel joined the staff of Gorky's
newspaper <i>Novaya Zhizn</i>. During the Revolution he worked
probably as a clerk for the Commissariat of Education and for the
CheKa, the Soviet Secret Police.</p>


      <p>In 1919, Babel married Eugenia Gronfein and joined the
Ukrainian State Publishing House (1919-20). He was assigned then as a
journalist to Field Marshall Budyonny's First Cavalry army, witnessing
its unsuccessful Polish campaign to carry Communist revolution outside
Russia. The Reds penetrated almost to Warsaw but were driven back. "I'm
tired," Babel confessed in <i>Konarmeyskiy Dnevnik 1920 Goda</i>, his
diary from which he drew material for <i>Red Cavalry</i>. "... life
flows past me, and what does it mean."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">1920 Diary</font></i><font size="2">, 1995)</font> A full
edited version of the diary was published in 1990 in Babel's collected
works. When Merian Caldwell Cooper, the future producer of the motion
picture <i>King Kong</i>, was captured by Cossacks behind the lines in
Galicia, he was interrogated by Babel in July 1920. "A shot-down
American pilot, barefoot but elegant, neck like a column, dazzlingly
white teeth, his uniform covered with oil and dirt," Babel recorded.
"He asks me worriedly: Did I maybe commit a crime by fighting against
Soviet Russia?" Eventually Cooper escaped to Riga, without his boots,
with which he bribed the guards at the border. </p>
      <p>While in Odessa Babel began to write a series of stories set
in the Odessan ghetto of Moldavanka, where he was born. "It was not
before 1923," Babel recalled later, "that I learned to express my
thoughts clearly and not too wordily. Then I went back to writing." <i>Tales
of Odessa</i> appeared in book form in 1931. It depicted with broad
strokes and humor the Jewish underworld, the middlemen, small
merchants, brokers, whores, tough Jewish gangsters, saloon keepers,
rabbis, and entrepreneurs, on the eve of Revolution. In the center of
the colourful caricature of the ghetto is Benia Krik, the king of
gangsters. The stories are entitled 'The King', 'How It Was Done in
Odessa', 'The Father', and 'Liuba the Cossack', where Benia Krik is
absent. In the play <i>Sunset </i>(1928) Babel returned to the Odessa
gangster world, but this time the protagonist was Benya's father,
Mendel Krik. It did not gain success and also <i>Marya </i>(1935)
attracted little attention. </p>
      <p>In 1923 Babel started to publish a cycle of novels called <i>Red
Cavalry</i>. Like <a href="maupassa.htm">Maupassant</a>, Babel often
surprises the reader with twists in the plot. In<i> Red Cavalry </i>basically
a pacifist narrator, Liutov, who is a Jewish officer, is assigned to a
regiment of traditionally anti-Semitic Cossacs. The joke was, as Jorge
Luis Borges has stated, that "the mere idea of a Jew on horseback
struck them as laughable, and the fact that Babel was a good horseman
only added to their disdain and spite." In one tale, 'Zamosc,' the
narrator falls asleep and his horse drags him to the front line of the
battle. He wakes looking up at a Russian peasant, armed with a rifle,
who tells him, "It's all the fault of those Yids." Out of the horror of
battles, torture and murder Babel creates a rapidly cutting polyphonic
tale of revolutionary change. Some stories are narrated in a stylized
form of the Cossacks' own language. Two stories appeared in
Mayakovsky's magazine <i>LEF</i>. The work was translated into more
than 20 languages, gaining Babel national fame, but it was also
attacked by Commander Semyon Budyonny of the First Cavalry, who claimed
that its emphasis on brutal acts insulted his troops. Babel was
defended by Gorky. Budyonny rose in the Party system, becoming Hero of
the Soviet Union and a powerful enemy. </p>
      <p>From 1923 Babel lived mostly in Moscow. Among his friends was <a href="eburg.htm">Ilya Ehrenburg </a>who called him "a wise rabbi".
Babel often told him that the most important thing is the happiness of
people. According to Ehrenburg, he understood the goals of the
Revolution and saw it as a guarantee of future happiness. He had an
affair with Evgeniya Gladun-Khayutina, the future wife of Nikolai
Yezhov, a people's commissar. It was said, that he visited their home
even in the 1930s. Before he was allocated an apartment in Moscow in a
house occupied by foreigners, he served for a period as the secretary
of the village soviet in Molodyonovo. </p>
      <p>Babel's first wife, Yevgenia Gronfein, went to Paris in 1925,
for a "temporary" separation; his daughter Natalie was raised in
France. Babel's mother and sister lived in Brussels from 1926 on, but
the author himself did not leave the Soviet Union despite numerous
opportunities. Babel visited his wife in Paris and travelled on
journalistic assignments in Ukraine and the Caucasus. He also served as
a secretary of a village soviet in Molodenovo. Between the years 1925
and 1930 he wrote a series of fictionalized accounts of his childhood
and young manhood. In the loosely autobiographical 'Story of My
Dovecote' he described the fate of a murdered grandfather.</p>
      <p>Babel's literary reputation was high in the Soviet Union and
abroad in the beginning of the 1930s. He revised his stories for his
collected works that appeared in 1932 and 1936. From the mid-1930s,
Babel avoided publicity under increasing Stalinist persecution,
although he worked on film scripts, including Eisenstein's banned <i>Bezhin
Meadow</i> and on a new book. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1934 Babel joked, "If one talks about
silence, one cannot fail to say that I am a great master of that
genre." However, Antonina Pirozhkova, an young engineer with whom Babel
spent his last years in Moscow, states that he was prolific during that
period. His speech in 1935 at the International Congress of Writers in
Paris about Soviet people and culture made a great impression. <i>Mariya</i>,
his play, was withdrawn from a Moscow theatre. The autobiographical
short story 'Di Grasso' (1937) was the last work to be published in
Babel's lifetime. It depicted his enthusiasm about theatre in his youth
&#8211; he has pawned his father's watch with Kolya Schwartz to visit Theatre
Street but Kolya does not return it before his wife gets angry about
it. When <a href="mandelst.htm">Osip Mandelstam</a> had returned from exile to Moscow, Babel said to him: "Silence won't save me. Mark my words &#8211; they will come for me soon." <br>
 </p>

      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Clutching the watch, I was left
alone, and suddenly, with a lucidity I had never known before, I saw
soaring columns of the Duma, the illuminated foliage on the boulevard,
the bronze head of Pushkin glimmering faintly in the moonlight, and I
saw for the first time everything around me as it was in reality &#8211;
silent, and indescribably beautiful." </b>(in 'Di Grasso') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Babel was arrested by the N.K.V.D., a precursor of the K.G.B,
in May 1939 at his cottage in Peredelkino, the writers' colony. The
secret police confiscated nine folders from the dacha, and fifteen from
his Moscow apatment. Under interrogation and probable torture at
Lubyanka, Babel confessed a long association with Trotskyites and
engaging in anti-soviet activity, including being recruited into a spy
network by Ilya Ehrenburg and supplying André Malraux with the secrets
of Soviet aviation. His trial was held in Buturka Prison and on January
27, 1940, he was shot on Stalin's orders for espionage. His body was
dumped in a communal grave. The Soviet officials informed Babel's widow
that her husband died on March 17, 1941 in a prison camp in Siberia.
Babel's charges were posthumously cleared in 1954. His seized
manuscripts have not been recovered. Babel's collected works, based on
the 1936 edition but including new materials, were republished in 1957
and 1966. Antonina Pirozhkova, who devoted her life to his literary
legacy, wrote a memoir of the last years of his life; she died in
September 2010, at the age of 101. </p>
