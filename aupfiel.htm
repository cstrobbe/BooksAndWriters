<P><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></P>


<P>English-Australian mystery writer, who roamed in his youth the sub-continent working as a boundary-rider, cattle-drower, rabbit-trapper and station-manager. Upfield's famous hero is the Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (or 'Bony', as he is known in the books familiarly), the son of an unknown white man and an aborigine mother. Bony is a gentleman and genius of criminal science, who has an M.A. degree from Brisbane University. During his investigations Bony frequently faces race prejudices but wins them with his wit and smile. Bony is fully aware of his talents and solves crimes confidently through patience. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;'Every successful investigator owes much to Lady Luck,' he told Irwin. 'No investigator ever begins to be successful unless driven by curiosity. Luck, curiosity, plus a little inductive reasoning into the behavior of foxes and eagles, will raise any police recruit to the top of his department.'&quot;</B> (from </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">Cake in the Hat Box</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, 1954) </FONT><FONT SIZE="2"></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>William Arthur Upfield  was born in Gosport, Hampshire,  the son of James Oliver Upfield, a 
prosperous draper, and Annie Upfield, n&#233;e Barmore, a shop assistant. Very soon in his early 
years,  Upfield's first names were reversed, and he became known as Arthur William. From the age 
of six or seven, he lived with his grandparents for a period, and then returned to his parents' home. On 
leaving school at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a firm of estate agents, but he failed 
the qualifying examination &#150; partly because he spent all his time with writing unpublished novels, Sexton Blakeish thrillers. 
However, at school he had had problems with spelling and he failed in English. Around the age of eighteen, he joined as a part-time trooper the Hampshire Carabineers Yeomanry. </P>
<P>Upfiled's father sent him to Australia in 1911, so he would be less likely to bring disgrace to the family 
and he would have a new opportunity to seek his fortune. Upfield was fascinated by the wildness 
and freedom of the country. During the following years he travelled widely, working in odd jobs, 
such as a cook in a hotel,   boundary rider for sheep stations, and cowhand, among other things. 
He learned of the Aboriginals, their culture, and this period gave him much of the material 
that he would later use in his fiction. Rumors, that  at some point of his life he he 
had an Aboriginal wife and childred, have never been confirmed. In<I> Follow My Dust!</I> (1957) 
he said: &quot;In all human history no people are closer to the Christian ideals than the 
Australian aborigine, and next to him is the white man who is captured by the 
aborigines' Spirit of the inland. Give an aborigine a pair of trousers, and another is 
wearing them the next day. Give him a hunk of meat, and he shares it all round. The white man 
is hungry, hand him a meal.&quot; 
&quot;</P>
<P>With the outbreak of World War I, Upfield joined the Australian Imperial Force. 
He fought at Gallipoli and in Egypt and France. In 1915 he married in Anne Douglass, a nurse, 
whom he had met in a hospital near Alexandria while recovering from gastritis. His second youngest brother Nelson was killed on the Somme. </P>
<P>After the war Upfield returned to England, where he worked as a private secretary to an army 
officer. However, adjusting to normal life was not easy for him. &quot;With the ever-growing 
clarity I came to see that neither my wife nor I would be happy in England, no matter what height 
I reacher,&quot; he later said.  Upfield sailed back to Australia in 1921. 
He continued 
his wandering and worked as an itinerant trapper, miner, whatever there was to be had,   realizing eventually that  &quot;the 
life road I was now traveling wasn't going to make me upward into the light of prosperity and happiness 
and contentment.&quot; </P>

<P>In the late 1920s Upfield started again to plan career 
in literature. He took a job as a cook at the isolated Wheeler's Well in New South Wales 
and spent his spare time in writing. He produced four novels, 
among them<I> The House of Cain</I> (1928), 
in which a hideout for 
murderers is run by an evil millionaire murderer. His serious novels did not sell 
well, but with Bony Bonaparte and<I> The Barakee Mystery</I> (1929) Upfield finally gained 
success. &quot;A mystery story whose plot is original yet entirely probable, whose 
setting is unusual, and whose characters are neither puppets nor monsters, deserves 
recognition,&quot; said a reviewer in the<I> Times Literary Supplement</I>. Noteworthy, Upfield's &quot;half-caste&quot; detective made his appearance when Aborigines were treated as something less than human. </P>
<P>Upfield had made in the bush the acquaintance of Leon Wood, a half-caste Aborigine, a tracker employed by the Queensland Police. &quot;He was the son of a station owner, and had received a high school education. Like all his type, the bush had drawn him back and claimed him.&quot; Upfied decided that he would change the white detective in<I> The Barrakee Mystery</I> to his friend and Wood became the model for his detective hero, Inspector Napoleon (Boney) Bonaparte. Bony was found beneath a sandalwood tree when he was two-week-old infant, beside his dead mother, and brought to a mission school. There he was named after the subject of a book he was attempting to eat. After reveiving a Master of Arts at the University in Brisbane, Bony joined the Queenland police service. His wife, the grey-eyed Marie, is also half-caste; they have three sons, Charles, Bob, and Ed. Bony has initiation marks on his back and chest, made with a sharp flint. He uses the skills of both his cultures, Aboriginal instincts and Western intelligence, and he likes tough cases which take him all over Australia. </P>

<P>Bony was in 29 novels. J.B. Priestley wrote of Upfield: &quot;If you like 
detective stories that are something more than puzzles, that have solid characters 
and backgrounds, that avoid familiar patterns of crime and detection, then Mr 
Upfield is your man.&quot; In <I>The New Shoe</I> (1952) an old craftsman makes a red-gum casket, 
which nearly becomes Bony's coffin. <I>The Man of Two Tribes </I>(1956) is a story of survival 
in the desolate Nullarbor Plains. In <I>Murder Down Under </I>(1937) Bony is on holiday in
 western Australia and meets the bizarre Mr. Jelly, an amateur criminologist who collects 
portraits of murders. The critic H.R.F. Keating included in 1987 Upfield's 
<I>The Sands of Windee</I> (1931) among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. 
In the story about a &quot;perfect murder&quot; Upfield invented a method to destroy carefully 
all evidence of the crime. His &quot;Windee method&quot; was used in a true-life crime, 
the Snowy Rowles murder case, 
in which one of his friend was killed.  Like in the fictional story, 
a murder was concealed by the mixing of human and kangaroo ashes. It was assumed that 
the perpetrator had heard Upfield discussing the plot of the novel with his 
companions at Dromedary camel station in 1929. 


 </P>
<P>In <I>Cake in the Hat Box</I> (1954) Bony is caught between two systems of justice. 
Constable Stenhouse is found dead in his police jeep on a lonely dirt road. Bony soon 
realizes that he is not the only person searching for the feller who shot Stenhouse. 
Jacky Musgrave, the police tracker, is supposedly killed and the local aborigine tribe 
wants vengeance too. Bony tells Constable Irwin about aborigines: &quot;They are loyal 
to white men living for a long time in their own locality, and suspicious of all others. 
It takes years of association and study to reach even the middle of the bridge spanning 
the gulf between them and us. Be patient. A thousand years are as nothing in this timeless 
land, and when the last aboriginal sinks down to die, despite the veneer imposed on him 
by our civilization, he will be the same man as were his forebears ten thousand years 
ago.&quot;  By modern standards, some of the content of the books would not be 
considered politically correct &#150; Upfield refers to Aborigines as &quot;Abos&quot; which was 
acceptable in Australia  in the 1960s but is not acceptable today. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;It was one of Bony's axioms that Time is the investigator's greatest ally.&quot; </B>&#150; <B>&quot;Bony felt the satin smoothness of wood, was reminded of the red sand of inland, the real heart of Australia which fools continue to claim dead.&quot;</B> (from </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">The New Shoe</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, 1952) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>According to the journalist and Upfield's serials agent 
Pamela Ruskin, the author was a tough, irascible, 
wiry man, with slate-colored eyes and &quot;a thin 
trap of a mouth and ears like jug handles.&quot; He 
wrote normally for five hours every day, 
typing with two fingers, smoking while writing, 
and ignoring spelling. It took about seven months to 
complete a book.  In the early 1930s, Upfield ran with 
his wife a guest house in Kalamunda; 
novels had not brought them a fortune. He was then employed by the Melbourne afternoon paper, the<I> Herald.</I> 
After the outbreak of WW II, he volunteered for the Australian Imperial Forces, receiving  an appointment 
as a military censor at the headquarters. </P>
<P>During the war such Bone novels as <I>Murder Down Under</I> 
(Doubleday, 1943),  <I>Wings Above the Claypan</I> (Doubleday, 1943), <I>No Footprints 
in the Bush </I>(Doubleday, 1944) were brought out in the United States. <I>Winds of Evil 
</I>(Doubleday, 1944) was placed by the mystery writer Craig Rice (pseudonym of Georgianna 
Ann Randolph)  at the head of her  ten &quot;whodunits&quot; of the year. 
The Doubleday Crime Club editions were not paperbacks, but well-designed hardbacks.
Upfield's sympathetic characterization 
of the world of Aborigines and skillful depiction of the natural environment, bush fires, 
drought, sudden rains and dry lakes, gave his works special quality which separated them 
from the usual style of hardboiled crime fiction.
</P>

<P>Although Upfield's mysteries attracted readers in England and America and received 
good reviews, 
 he was never 
wholeheartedly  admitted to the Australian literary establishment. 

In later years, Upfield became prominent 
in the Australian Geological Society. He led a major expedition in 1948 to northern and 
western parts of the country. The party included Michael Sharland,  journalist, 
Ray Bean,  photographer, Harry Tate, motor mechanic, George King, cook, 
and J.K. Ewers, author and columnist, whom Upfield had known since the 1930s. </P>

<P>
Arthur Upfield died in Bowral on February 13, 1964. 
The last Bony novel, <I>The Lake Frome Monster</I> (1966), was completed by J.L. 
Price and Dorothy Stange. Upfield's long-time companion, Jessica Hawke, 
published a biography in collaboration with author entitled <I>Follow My Dust! 
</I>It draws from a work he wrote in the 1930s, <I>The Tale of a Pommy</I>, 
but he not get it published. 

Upfield lived 
with Hawke at Airey's Inlet, Victoria, and at Bermagui and Bowral, New South Wales, 
from the late 1940s. </P>

1 September, 1890, not in 1888 as usually stated. Upfield himself once claimed that the certificate burned in a campfire in Queensland. </B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
