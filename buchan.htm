<p>Scottish diplomat, barrister, journalist, historian, poet, and novelist, whose most famous thriller was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Thirty-Nine Steps </span>(1915),
his 27th book, which has been filmed several times. Alfred Hitchcock's
film version of the story from 1935 is ranked as one of the director's
best achievemets. In addition to his large body of nonfiction, John
Buchan published nearly 30 novels and seven collections of short
stories.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Public life is regarded as the crown of
a career, and to young men it is the worthiest ambition. Politics is
still the greatest and the most honorable adventure." </b></font></blockquote>

<p>John Buchan was born in Perth, Scotland, the eldest son of Rev. John
Buchan and Helen (née Masterton) Buchan. In 1876 the family moved to
Pathhead, Fife, a small mining town, and then to Glasgow. After
attending Hutcheson's Grammar School, Buchan studied at the University
of Glasgow and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he had an outstanding
career, winning the Stanhope Essay Prize in 1897 and the Newdigate
Prize in the following year. In 1901 he became a barrister of the
Middle Temple and a private secretary to the High Commissioner for
South Africa, Lord Milner. <span style="font-style: italic;">Prester John</span>
(1910), set in the years after the Anglo-Boer War and written for an
adolescent male audience, was partly based on his South African
experiences. The title of the book refers to the fifteenth-century
legend of purpoted Christian priest and king of the Ethiopians. </p>
<p>Returning to London in 1903, Buchan specialized in tax law and
continued to write prolifically, both fiction and nonfiction. He joined
in 1906 the publisher Thomas Nelson and Sons, revitalized publication
of pocket editions of great literature, and virtually edited <i>The Spectator</i>.
In 1907 he married Susan Charlotte Grosvenor; they had three sons and
one daughter. After the outbreak of WWI, Buchan tried to enlist but was
refused because of an ulcer. Before being able to join the army, he
worked as a special correspondent for <i>The Times</i> on the Western
Front. The official War Propaganda Bureau commissioned him to write
accounts of major battles and various propaganda booklets. All his
best-selling thrillers from this period dealt with episodes in the war,
its outbreak, the Russian capture of the Turkish citadel of Erzurum,
and the final German offencives. In 1916-17 Buchan served on the
Headquarters Staff of the British Army in France as temporary
Lieutenant Colonel. When Lloyd George was appointed Prime Minister,
Buchan was made Director of Information, and then for a short time
Director of Intelligence, a brief interlude in Buchan's career of which
he did not much talk. After the war Buchan became a director of the
news agency Reuters. He was a strong supporter of the League of
Nations, he stressed the importance of close Anglo-American relations,
and he was concerned by the Bolshevik regime in Russia. His first visit
to America he made in 1924. </p>
<p>From 1927 to 1935 Buchan was a Conservative member of parliament for
the Scottish universities. He held a number of important government
posts, serving among others as Lord High Commissioner of the Church of
Scotland (1933-34). In 1935 he was created the first Baron Tweedsmuir
of Elsfield and appointed Governor General of Canada. As European war
approached, he served as a trusted advisor to U.S. President Franklin
D. Roosevelt. Buchan died in office in Montreal, Canada, on February
11, 1940, after suffering a stroke. </p>
<p>Buchan began his literary career in the 1890s. His first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sir Quixote of the Moors</span> (1895), came out while he was still a student at Brasenose College, Oxford. It was followed by such works as <span style="font-style: italic;">Scholar-Gipsies</span> (1896) and <span style="font-style: italic;">History of Brasenose</span>
(1898). At Oxford Buchan wrote five books, and before he was
twenty-five he had published eight books. However, he did not devote
himself entirely to writing. After a sojourn in South Africa, Buchan
became a dedicated supporter of Britain's imperialism, and viewed some
of his earlier literary endeavours rather uncomfortable. <span style="font-style: italic;">Grey Weather</span> (1899), his first collection of tales and sketches, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Watcher by the Treshold</span> (1902), included some tacitly pagan stories. </p>
<p>While ill in bed in 1914, during the first months of the war, Buchan wrote <i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i>,
which introduced the spy-catcher Richard Hannay, who was modelled after
a young Army officer named Edmund Ironside, later Field-Marshal Lord
Ironside of Archangel. Hannay had all the qualities of a hero, who
could defend the English way of life against foreign thread &#8211; he is
resourceful, courageous, "solid and respectable citizen" devoted to his
own country &#8211;&nbsp; but he
was not an calculating agent, more of an innocent abroad. And he had no
taste for violence and he was not interested in sex like James Bond. <br>
</p>
      <p>In the story Hannay, a 37-year-old wealthy Scot, meets an
American journalist, named Scudder, who tells of an international
assassination plan. Scudder is murdered, and Hannay realizes that he is
the prime suspect. He flees to Scotland, and hides there from the
police and the foreign conspirators and other anarchists. Hannay
guesses that Scudders's cryptic note ("Thirty-nine steps &#8211; I counted
them &#8211; High tide 10:17 p.m.) refers to the location of the anarchists'
beach house. The conspirators are arrested. </p>

<p>A consistent theme in Buchan's thrillers was that nothing is as it seems &#8211; behind a 
respectable facade, there is a hidden agenda and deeply buries secrets, threatening the order 
of modern society. Or as he wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Power House</span>
(1916): "You think that a wall as solid as the earth separates
civilization from Barbarism. I tell you the division is a thread, a
sheet of glass. ..." Buchan had supported Zionist movement, but
anti-Jewish clichés occur in his books frequently. By the end of WWI,
Buchan had acquired a bitter taste of war, although war and adventure
are still the different sides of the same coin in <i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i>. His brother Alastair and best friend 
Tommy Nelson were killed in 1917. <span style="font-style: italic;">These for Remembrance</span> (1919) commemorated six close 
friends killed in the war. </p>

<p>Richard Hannay was portrayed again in <span style="font-style: italic;">Greenmantle </span>(1916), Buchan's tenth novel, where the hero plays a 
spy and stops the Germans from using an Islamic prophet for their own ends. This time Hannay's adventures 
take him through Germany and the Balkans to Constantinople and finally to the Near East front of World War 
I. Another series character, Sandy Arbuthnot, partly modelled after T.E. Lawrence, tackle with Hannay and 
Sir Archibald Roylance a 
gang of international criminals in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Three Hostages</span> (1924). Although Hannay appeared in Buchan's 
later novels, too, his career as an adventurer ends in this story &#8211; he has married Mary Lamington from 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Mr Standfast</span> (1919), has a son, 
is happy with his life as lord of Fosse Manor, and he is first reluctant to assist his former colleagues. "It was 
jolly to see the world coming to life againg," Hannay thinks in the beginning of the story, "and to remember 
that this patch of England was my own, and all these wild things, so to speak, members of my little household." 
With his thrillers, Buchan established a certain type of hero, who did not have as hard-boiled mentality as 
the American adventurer detectives, and certain plot patterns, that were adopted by such writers as H.C. McNeile, 
<a href="/ewallace.htm">Edgar Wallace</a>, and <a href="/house.htm">Geoffrey Household</a>. </p>
<p>The lawyer and politician Edward Leithen, perhaps the most
autobiographical of Buchan's heroes, was the central character in three
novels, starting from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Power House</span>, and continuing in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dancing Floor</span> (1926), which returned again in the theme of paganism, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gap in the Curtain</span> (1932), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sick Heart River</span> (1941).<i> The Gap in the Curtain</i>
was a supernatural story, in which the guests at a country house party
are enabled by an unconventional scientist to catch a glimpse of an
issue of the <i>Times </i>dated a year ahead. Sir Edward finds himself
in the middle of an old struggle between faith and doubt. Dickson
McGunn, a respectable Glaskow grocer, was featured in <span style="font-style: italic;">Huntingtower</span> (1922), <span style="font-style: italic;">Castle Gay</span> (1930), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The House of the Four Winds</span> (1935). <span style="font-style: italic;">Witch Wood&nbsp;</span>
(1927), a historical novel set in 17th-century Scotland, told about
stern Scottish Protestants and devil worship. <br>
</p>
      <p>All his spare time Buchan devoted to writing. His chief
recretional outlets were riding, climbing, and walking. On of Buchan's
most loved
books is <span style="font-style: italic;">John Macnab</span> (1925),
which tells of three bored gentlemen of the establishment, a lawyer,
banker, and Tory Cabinet Minister, who form a poaching trinity under
their invented "a nom de guerre", John Macnab. Buchan's other works
include the 24-volume <span style="font-style: italic;">Nelson's History of the War</span>
(1915-19), biographies of Montrose (1913, 1928), Walter Scott (1932),
Oliver Cromwell (1934), and Augustus (1937). Buchan's autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">Memory Hold-the-Door</span> (1940) was published in North America under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Pilgrim's Way</span>.</p>

<p>Buchan was one of the favorite writers of <a href="hitch.htm">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, who had toyed with the idea of filming <i>Greenmantle</i>.
Often in Hitchcock's films an innocent man is chased by the police and
the villains. In one scene Hannay says: "I know what it is to feel
lonely and helpless and to have the whole world against me, and those
are things that no men or women ought to feel."<font size="2"></font>
The basic outline of the story was thoroughly worked over in the screen
version. At the end Hitchcock parallels handcuffs with a suggestion of
marriage. The sequence in which Hannay was first protected and then
betrayed by a jealous Highland crofter, have no counterpart in the book
at all. <i>The 39 Steps </i>was crucial for Hitchcock's career &#8211; it
became an international success and brought him to the attention of the
American producer David O. Selznick, with whom he would cooperate in <i>Rebecca </i>(1940) and other productions. </p>
<p>Anna Masterton Buchan (1877-1948), Buchan's sister, took the pseudonym O. Douglas for her first book, <i>Olivia in India: The Adventures of a Chota Miss Sahib</i>
(1913), saying: "I did not want to use my name as (in my opinion) John
had given lustre to the name of Buchan which any literary efforts of
mine would not be likely to add to, so I called myself 'O. Douglas'."
George O'Brien wrote in <i>Mystery &amp; Suspense Writers</i> (1998): "Victor Maskell, the protagonist modeled on Sir Anthony Blunt in John Banville's the <i>Untouchable</i>
(1997), may regard Buchan as ridiculously old-fashioned. But the kind
of material which his thrillers were first to bring into focus &#8211; the
conspiratorial shadow cast by contemporary history, the challenge to
integrity and cohesion, the bleak vicissitudes of international power
play &#8211; continue their complex existence in the genre, as shown in not
only <i>Kumari </i>(1955) and <i>Helen All Alone </i>(1961) by Buchan's son, William, but also in <i>Heart's Journey in Winter</i> (1995) and <i>High Latitudes: A Romance</i> (1996), by James Buchan, John Buchan's grandson."<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">Mystery &amp; Suspense Writers</font></i><font size="2">, vol. 1, ed. by Robin W. Winks, 1998) </font></p>
