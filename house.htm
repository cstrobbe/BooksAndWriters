<p>British author of thrillers, who published some thirty-seven books
including children's fiction. Household's flight-and-chase novels,
which show the influence of <a href="buchan.htm">John Buchan</a>, were often narrated in the first person by a gentleman-adventurer. Among his best-know works is <i>Rogue Male</i>
(1939), a suggestive story of a hunter who becomes the hunted. It
appeared just before the outbreak of World War II, and started with a
scene in which an English sportsman looks at his target, an unnamed
European dictator, through the rifle sight. The book was filmed by
Fritz Lang in 1941 as <i>Man Hunt</i>. Household's fast-paced story foreshadowed such international bestsellers as Richard Condon's thriller <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i> (1959), Frederick Forsyth's <i>The Day of the Jackal</i> (1971), in which a ruthless hit man plans to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle of France, and Ken Follett's novel <i>Eye of the Needle </i>(1978), a story about the tracing of a German agent in the wartime England. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">"<b>The ethics of revenge? The same as the ethics of war, old boy! Unless you are a conscientious objector, you cannot condemn me." </b>(from <i>Rogue Male</i>, 1939) </font></blockquote>
<p>Geoffrey Household was born in Bristol, the son of Beatrice (Norton)
Household and Horace W. Household, a lawyer, who became secretary of
education for Gloucester. Household was educated at Clifton College,
Bristol (1914-1919) and Magdalen College, Oxford, receiving his B.A. in
English in 1922. Between the years 1922 and 1935, Household was engaged
in commerce abroad, though he had dreamed of being a poet. In Bucharest
he worked for four years as an assistant confidential secretary for
Bank of Romania. In 1926 Household went to Spain, where he worked as a
marketing manager for Elders and Fyffes, banana vendors for the United
Fruit Company. During this period he learned to speak and write
Spanish. </p>
<p>After moving to the United States in 1929, Household wrote for
children's encyclopedias and composed children's radio plays for
Columbia Broadcasting System. From 1933 to 1939 he was a traveling
salesman for John Kidd, a manufacturer of printing ink, in Europe, the
Middle East, and South America. During World War II Household served in
the Intelligence Corps. He led a unit in Greece, and in Romania, he was
to assist in blowing up the oil fields if threatened by the German
army. Much of the was he spent in the Middle East. Household was
decorated for his service. <br>
 </p>
<p>Household's wandering years gave him valuable material for his
novels, which often take the reader to different parts of the world.
Several of his of heroes have a bicultural background &#8211; as the
Ecuadorian-English Claudio Howard-Wolferstan of <i>Fellow Passenger</i> (1955), the Argentinian-born English botanist of <i>Dance of the Dwarfs</i> (1968), and Adrian Gurney of <i>Red Anger</i>
(1975), who is half Rumanian. Household started to write sporadically
already in the 1920s. His first story, 'The Salvation of Pisco Gabar'
was published in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1936. As a novelist he debuted with<i> The Terror of Villadonga</i>, which came out in the same year. This  adventure story for children described the discovery of a prehistoric sea-beast. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Prisoner of the Indies</span> (1967), another children's book, told about the adventures of a young sailor on one of Sir John Hawkin's ships.&nbsp; </p>
<p><i>Rogue Male</i> appeared first in serialized form in the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Atlantic Monthly</span>,
between July and September 1939, on the eve of WWII. The novel, which
marked Household's breakthrough as a thriller writer, was then issued
in a special edition for distribution to the British Armed forces. <br>
</p>
      <p>The anonymous protagonist is a big game hunter, who is caught
stalking the sinister dictator of nameless state and perhaps trying to
alter the course of world history. Household do not not specifically
mention German, Hitler and the Nazis, but he doesn't on the other hand
leave much other alternatives.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"Like most
Englishmen, I am not accustomed to inquire very deeply into motives...
I remember asking myself when I packed the telescopic sight what the
devil I wanted it for; but I just felt that it might come in handy."
The narrator-hero is tortured and thrown from a cliff, apparently to
his death, but he survives miraculously and escapes to England.
However, his pursues do not give up the chase. After showdown on the
moors of Dorset the hero writes in his confessional diary, that one
must hunt animals in their natural surroundings <font face="Symbol">-</font> and the natural surroundings of  human beings is the city. "I shall not miss," he promises.  <i>Rogue Male</i>
deals with a basic moral problem: if the death of one person could save
a number of lives, does it justify the killing of the person in
question? </p>

<p>Fritz Lang's movie version of the book, entitled <i>Man Hunt</i>,
was released in 1941, some months before America's entry into the war
in Europe. However, Lang did not water down its antifascist message,
although Hollywood's Production Code Administration ordered the removal
of some of its brutal scenes. At the end the hero (Walter Pidgeon)
joins the RAF and makes an unauthorized parachute jump to Germany to
finish his mission. </p>
<p> Household himself had a keen interest in shooting. The hide and seek formula was used in several of his works, among them <i>Dance of 
the Dwarfs</i>, set in the South American jungle, which also provided the milieu for the search 
of Utopia in <i>The Third Hour</i> (1937). Twelve of his novels dealt with international intrigue and espionage. In   <i>Rogue Justice</i> (1982) Household returned  
to the paranoid, doomsday atmosphere of <i>Rogue Male</i>. The hero in <i>Watcher in the Shadows</i>
(1960), Charles Dennim, abandons his civilized life and retreats to
rural England to trap a relentless ex-Resistance fighter, who wants to
revenge the death of his wife at the hand of Hitler's minions. The
roles of hunter and hunter are repeatedly exchanged. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dance of the Dwarfs</span> men are hunted by feral prehistoric survivals. <br>
 </p>

<p>Besides writing thrillers and children's books Household also published an autobiography, 
<i>Against the Wind </i>(1958), and several collections of short stories, which he himself 
considered his best work. In one of his short pieces, 'Tell These Men to Go Away,' set 
in Hungary, an old English lady, Miss Titterton,  keeps her principles of truth, courage 
and good manners in the middle of the war. With all the stiff dignity of a governess, who 
has taught two generations of spoilt children, she defies the German Army and refuses to 
give her furniture to SS. Finally she is thrown into jail, receiving no special privileges 
beyond permission to decorate her cell with curtains and chintz covers and to invite 
selected prisoners to coffee. "Miss Titterton felt that it was very forgiving of the 
Family to rescue her and fly her back to London immediately after the war. 
When they explained to her that prison had been the only way of preserving her 
from a quite certain concentration camp and the very possible attentions of the 
Gestapo, she tried hard to believe them. But in her experience, she said, justice 
was always done. She was afraid it stood reason that she had deserved her sentence 
&#8211; perhaps for not taking enough care with the unruly member, my dear. 
It was very kind of them all to accept her disgrace so l
ight-heartedly."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Europe That Was</font></i><font size="2">, 1979) </font></p>
<p>Household was married twice, first to Elisaveta Kopelanoff, a
Romaian-born American, who encouraged his early writing attempts. In
1942 he married the former Ilona M.J. Zsoldos-Gutmàn; they had one son
and two daughters. He had met her in Jerusalem while posted there as a
field security officer. After the war Household spent his time writing
and as a country gentleman, first in Dorset, and later in
Buckinghamshire. Household died on October 4, 1988. His last novel, <i>Face to the Sun</i>, appeared in the year of his death. Household published also science fiction novels, 
supernatural fiction, and fantasy stories. <i>The Cats to Come</i> (1975) told about a future 
world run by felines. 
<i>Hostage London: The Diary of Julian Despard</i> (1977) was a near-future thriller and <i>Summon the Bright Water</i> (1981) was set in a post-Holocaust UK.
