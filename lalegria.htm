<P>Salvadoran-Nicaraguan poet, novelist, essayist, and human-rights activist, noted for her <I>testimonio</I>, accounts of the Sandinista movement and the experience of Salvadoran revolutionaries. Most of her life, Claribel Alegr&iacute;a has spent outside El Salvador in self-imposed exile, in the U.S., Europe, and Mexico and other Latin American countries, but in the 1980s she took up residence in Nicaragua. Alegr&iacute;a's most acclaimed books include <I>Cenizas de Izalco</I> (1966, Ashes of Izalco),<I> Sobrevivo</I> (1978), and<I> Saudade </I>(1999, Sorrow).</P>

<P>Claribel Alegr&iacute;a was born Clara Isabel Alegr&iacute;a Vides in Estel&iacute;, Nicaragua, but she grew up in exile in Santa Ana, El Salvador, where her family had moved when she was still an infant. Daniel Alegr&iacute;a, her father, was a medical doctor and supporter of Augusto C&eacute;sar Sandino. After opposing the the U.S. occupation of Nicaragua in 1924 he was forced into exile. </P>
<P>Alegr&iacute;a's mother, Ana Mar&iacute;a Vides, was a Salvadorean, whose family belonged to the coffee planter elite. Later Alegr&iacute;a described her grandparent's house in Santa Ana in <I>Luisa en el pa&iacute;s de la realidad</I> (1987, Luisa in Realityland), an experimental novel consisting of short stories, poems and vignettes. </P>
<P>Alegr&iacute;a attended Jos&eacute; Ingenieros school, founded by her uncle, Ricardo Vides. After winning a scholarship, she spent a summer term at the Loyola University, New Orleans. At the age of 19, she moved to the U.S., where she studied at the George Washington University, Washington DC., receiving in 1948 her B.A. degree in philosophy and letters.</P>

<P>In 1947 Alegr&iacute;a married the U.S.-born journalist Darwin J. ("Bud") Flakoll; they had three daughters and one son. Flakoll coauthored some of her novels and translated much of her work into English. He died in 1995. Alegr&iacute;a's<I> Sorrow</I>, a collection of love poems, was written for her deceased husband. </P>
<P>Alegr&iacute;a began her literary career under the influence of the Nobel laureate <A href="../../../jimenez.htm">Juan Ram&oacute;n Jimenez</A>, with whom he studied in Washington, DC. Also Emily Dickinson inspired her work. Alegr&iacute;a's first poetry collection, <I>Anillo de silencio</I>, was&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1948. According to some sources, she took the pen name of Claribel Alegr&iacute;a by the suggestion of Jos&eacute; Vasconcelos, a Mexican philosopher and writer. </P>
<P>In 1951, Alegr&iacute;a moved to Mexico and to Santiago de Chile in 1953, where she and her husband worked on a anthology of 
Latin American Writers. In 1956 she returned to the United States. A turning point in Alegr&iacute;a's career was the Cuban 
Revolution of 1959. Her writing, which earlier had been introspective and meditative, took a more politically aware and 
radical turn. As a figure of resistance, Alegr&iacute;a eventually went into exile from El Salvador. However, 
later Alegr&iacute;a has said that she never wanted to subordinate her literary work to political activism.</P>

<P>For the first forty years of her life, Alegr&iacute;a mostly published poetry. Alegr&iacute;a's style, in blank verse, is urgent 
and straightforward; female identity, love, death, and suffering are recurring motifs, but her focus is the Central American reality, of which she writes with commitment and passion: "my wounded country, / my child, / my tears, / my obsession" (from 'Documentary'). In the poem 'Eramos tres' (<I>Flores de volc&aacute;n</I>, 1982) Alegr&iacute;a called herself a "cementerio ap&aacute;trida" (a cemetary without a country) – in her work, the memories and ideals of the dead live on. </P>
<P>While living in Paris, Alegr&iacute;a wrote with Flakoll <I>Cenizas de Izalco</I>, which broke the traditional literary 
discourse and signaled the end of social realism. The novel was a finalist in the Biblioteca Breve competition sponsored by Saeix Barral.&nbsp;It uses diaries as a narrative vehicle, re-creates the 1932 
"Matanza" (massacre) of over 30,000 Salvadoran peasants by government troops. At the time of the event Alegr&iacute;a 
was eight; she witnessed the aftermath scenes of the uprising, and remained traumatized for many years. <I>Cenizas de Izalco 
</I>was first condemned in El Salvador by authorities and publicly burned. However, later it was used a secondary school 
textbook. The subject was suggested by Carlos Fuentes; Alegria first hesitated because until then she had not written prose.
</P>
<P>Alegr&iacute;a accompanied her husband on diplomatic posting to Argentina and Uruguay. Disillusioned by the U.S.-supported Bay of Pigs invasion&nbsp; of Cuba Flakoll eventually resigned from his job and returned to journalism. In the 1960s they lived in Paris and on the island of Mallorca, first in Palma Nova and later in Dei&aacute;. The island was a source for Alegr&iacute;a's novella <I>Pueblo de Dios y de Mandinga</I> (1985, Village of God and the Devil). She also met in Mallorca the English writer Robert Graves. Alegr&iacute;a and Flakoll translated Graves's poetry into Spanish. </P>
<P>Alegr&iacute;a has also marked the assassination of Archbishop Romero in 1980 as a turning point in her own conscientization. On a trip to El Salvador she saw people put sings in their windows reading, "Haga patria, mate un cura" (be a patriot kill a priest). </P>
<P>In her historical/testimonial books Alegr&iacute;a has fused the personal and the political, the collective and the internal. After the fall of Anastasio Somoza and the rise of the Sandinistas to power in 1979, Alegr&iacute;a traveled with Flakoll to Nicaragua, where they moved in 1985. During this period they collected material for <I>Nicaragua: la revoluci&oacute;n sandinista: una cr&oacute;nica pol&iacute;tika, 1855-1979</I> (1982). In 1983 Alegr&iacute;a published with Flakoll <I>No me agarran viva</I> (They Won’t Take Me Alive). The book, based on interviews, tells of the life and death of a young Salvadorian guerrilla and mother, Eugenia, who was a member of the FMLN (Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation). </P>
<P><I>Somoza: expediente cerrado, la historia de un ajusticiamento</I> (1993, Death of Somoza) reveals the story of the assassination of the deposed Nicaraguan President Somoza in Asunci&oacute;n, Paraguay. On the recommendation of the novelist <A href="../../../cortaz.htm">Julio Cort&aacute;zar</A>, Alegr&iacute;a and Flakoll met a contact person, who helped them to meet and interview the survivors of the commando team, that carried out the "bringing to justice" of Somoza. </P>
<P>Alegr&iacute;a is one of Central America's major poetical voices. She has recorded the experience of revolutionaries, the contributions of women involved in the struggle for a new society, and the fate of political prisoners, who have been silenced. In her interest in recovering women's history and bringing women to the foreground, she shares much in common with postcolonial writers from Africa, India, and the Caribbean. </P><P>Alegr&iacute;a's&nbsp;prizes include the Cuban-sponsored Casa de las Am&eacute;ricas Prize in 1978 for <I>Sobrevivo</I>, the 2006 Neustadt International Prize for Literature. The University of Eastern Connecticut awarded her a Doctorate Honoris Causa in 1998. Besides her poetry and prose writings, Alegr&iacute;a has translated works by Robert Graves, Miguel Angel Asturias, and Salman Rushdie. With Flakoll she translated and published<I> On the Front Line</I> (1990), an anthology of Salvadoran guerrilla poetry. Alegr&iacute;a made in 2002 a reading tour with the poet Ernesto Cardenal in the northeastern United States. In the 2006 presidential election she supported the economist Edmundo Jarquin of the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS).
