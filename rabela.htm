<p>French Renaissance writer, a Franciscan monk, humanist, and physician, whose comic novels <i>Gargantua</i> and 
<i>Pantagruel</i> are among the most hilarious classics of world
literature. François Rabelais' heroes are rude but funny giants
traveling in a world full of greed, stupidity, violence, and grotesque
jokes. The true target of his satire was the feudal and the
ecclesiastical powers, and the world of the learned. Rabelais' books
were banned by the Catholic Church and later placed on The Index
librorum prohibitorumon (the Index of Forbidden Books). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Afterwards I wiped my tail with a hen,
with a cock, with a pullet, with a calf's skin, with a hare, with a
pigeon, with a cormorant, with an attorney's bag, with a montero, with
a coif, with a falconer's lure. But, to conclude, I say and maintain,
that of all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tail-napkins, bunghole
cleansers, and wipe-breeches, there is none in the world comparable to
the neck of a goose, that is well downed, if you hold her head betwixt
your legs. And believe me therein upon mine honour, for you will
thereby feel in your nockhole a most wonderful pleasure, both in regard
of the softness of the said down and of the temporate heat of the
goose, which is easily communicated to the bum-gut and the rest the
inwards, in so far as to come even to the regions of the heart and
brains."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Gargantua</font></i><font size="2">, 1534) </font></blockquote>
<p>François Rabelais was born in 1484 (or 1483, 1490, 1495) near the
town of Chinon in western France. His father Antoine Rabelais owned
vineyards there. According to some sources he was a lawyer, according
to others an apothecary or inn-keeper. Little is known about Rabelais'
youth and time at the Abbaye de Seuillé, where he was sent. He was a
novice at the Convent of La Baumette, where the brothers de Bellay may
have been among his fellow students. He became a member of the
Franciscan convent at Fontenay-le-Comte, in Lower Poitou, and by 1521
he had taken holy orders. <br>
</p>
      <p>At the fair of Fontenay-le-Comte, Rabelais heard stories which stirred his imagination, and he later wrote in <i>Gargantua</i>:
"He went to see the jugglers, tumblers, mountebanks, and quacksalvers,
and considered their cunning, their shifts, their somersaults and
smooth tongue, especially of those of Chauny in Picardy, who are
naturally great praters, and brave givers of fibs, in matter of green
apes." After the ecclesiastical authorities of the Sorbonne started to
confiscate Greek books, Rabelais petitioned Pope Clement VII. He
received permission to leave the Franciscan order and join the
Benedictines. </p>

<p>In the monasteries Rabelais had studied Greek, Latin, law,
astronomy, and ancient Greek medical texts, which had been ignored for
centuries. He left the Abbaye de Maillezais without permission and
started to study medicine, possibly with the Benedictines in their
Hôtel Saint-Denis in Paris, and then in Montpellier. In 1530 he became
bachelor of medicine. </p>
<p>At Montpellier Rabelais lectured on the ancient physicians,
Hippocrates and Galen. He made public dissections of human bodies and
was a specialist in the new disease, syphilis, and hysteria. Rabelais
also invented devices for the treatment of hernia and fractured bones
and published his own editions of Hippocrates'<i> Aphorisms</i> and Galen's <i>Ars parva</i>. In 1532 he was a physician at Hôtel-Dieu, a general hospital in Lyons.&nbsp; <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Pantagruel</i> (1532) was publisged under the pen
name
Alcofribas Nasier &#8211; an anagram of Rabelais's real name. It dealt with
the early years of Pantagruel, the son of Gargantua, and introduced the
cunning rogue Panurge, an Everyman, who became Pantagruel's companion.
Multifaceted Panurge is a sum of hodgepodge parts: a total coward, a
rogue, a rebel, a joyful fellow; his reactions to the world are not
governed by reasoning but childish emotions. Panurge is a stock type
character, but his source is thought to be possibly the <span style="font-style: italic;">Macaronaci Opus</span>,
burlesque poems written by Teofilo Folengo, a monk of the twelft
century. Often he serves as a spokesman for Rabelais's philosophical
and theological battles, which he waged against the Sorbonne and the
Catholic Church. <br>
</p>
      <p>Rabelais took the character of Gargantua from a booklet, which was sold
in Lyons, and depicted the adventures of a giant famous in oral folk
tradition. The city was at that time the cultural center of France and
famous for its international book trade. It was claimed that at one
Lyons fair more copies of the booklet were sold than Bibles in nine
years.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Pantagruel </span>was followed by <i>Gargantua</i> (1534). The books were highly successful, but condemned by the Parliament and the Sorbonne, which included them <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>on its list of censored books.&nbsp; <br>
 </p>


<p>In Lyon Rabelais fathered a son, Théodule, who died at the age of
two. He went to Rome as physician to his friend and patron Bishop Jean
du Bellay. Du Bellay was the bishop of Paris, who was later appointed
cardinal. In Rome Rabelais made archeological and botanical studies.
During the following years he visited the city several times. In 1536
he entered the monastery of Saint Maur-les-Fossés. The pope allowed him
to practise medicine and in 1537 Rabelais received his doctor's degree.
He lectured on medicine and in 1539 he served as the medical advisor of
Guillaume du Bellay in Turin. <br>
</p>
      <p>King Francis I of France (1494-1547) gave a license to print the third book of the Gargantua-Pantagruiel series, <i>Le Tiers Livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel</i>
(1546), which was dedicated to Margaret of Navarre, the King's sister.
At Court the party in favour of toleration was strong. Marguerite of
Navarre and Jean and Guillaume de Bellay had been willing to help those
who had trouble with religious authorities, and the King supported
moderate policies. He had also tried to defend Erasmus (1466-1536), the
famous humanist and scholar, against the attacks of theologians. In <i>Gargantua</i> Rabelais gave his support to the humanist ideal of King Francis I. <br>
 </p>

<p><i>Le Tiers Livre</i> (The Third Book) appeared under Rabelais' own
name, and again condemned in spite of the royal licence. Panurge
wonders if he should marry, and starts with Pantagruel a voyage to the
Oracle of the Holy Bottle for an answer. The king had been Rabelais'
protector, but as the king's health was declining, Rabelais fled to
Metz, where for a while he practised medicine. Although French
booksellers were not able to publish "heretical" works, they went on
selling and printing books by Rabelais and other writers simply
dropping their addresses from the title page. In <i>Pantagruel</i>
Rabelais wrote: "Printing likewise is now in use, so elegant and so
correct that better cannot be imagined, although it was found out but
in my time by divine inspiration, as by a diabolical suggestion on the
other side was the invention of ordnance." </p>
<p>In 1547 René du Bellay gave Rabelais the curacy of Saint-Christophe-du-Jambet, 
though he probably did not reside there. Later he was also given the curacy of Mendon, 
near Paris &#8211;  he was known as "the curate of Meudon". The fourth book in 
the series, <i>Le Quart Livre de Pantagruel</i>, came out in 1552;  a partial edition 
of the <i>Quart livre</i> 
had appeared in Lyons in 1549. Before his death, Rabelais acquired a new powerful enemy: 
he was denounced by John Calvin, and 
thus he had angered  both Catholics and Protestants. Rabelais died probably 
on April 9, 1553, in Paris. There have been doubts about the authenticity of the fifth book, 
<i>Cinquisme Live </i>(1564), where Panurge and his friends arrive at the temple of the Holy 
Bottle. The five books of <i>Gargantua</i> and <i>Pantagruel</i> were first published together 
in English by J. Martin in 1567. The fifth book was first printed without the name of the 
place, and the in 1565 at Lyons by Jean Martin. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Burn 'em, tear 'em, nip 'em with hot
pincers, drown 'em, hang 'em, spit 'em at the bunghole, pelt 'em, paut
'em, bruise 'em, beat 'em, cripple 'em, dismember 'em, cut 'em, gut

carbonade 'em on gridirons, these wicked heretics! decretalifuges,
decretalicides, worse than homicides, worse than patricides,
decretalictones of the devil of hell."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Le Quart Livre</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p>Rabelais mixed in his books elements from different narrative forms
&#8211; chronicle, farce, dialogue, commentary etc, and peppered them with
broad popular humor. With his flood of outrageous ideas and anecdotes
Rabelais emphasized the physical joys of life &#8211; food, drink, sex, and
bodily functions connected to them &#8211; and mocked asceticism and
oppressive religious and political forces. Much of their time Gargantua
and Pantagruel are occupied with drinking which earned Rabelais the
reputation of a drunkard. "Drink always and you shall never die,"
Rabelais wrote. In folklore Penthagruel was a dwarf-devil who preyed on
drunkards. Rabelais explained that Panta in Greek is all and Gruel
means in Hagarene language thirsty, thus his name means 'all-thirsty'. </p>
<p>Rabelais' work influenced a long line of writers from <a href="cervante.htm">Cervantes</a>,
Swift, and Laurence Sterne to James Joyce and Céline. With Cervantes he
shared the same satirical view of the romances of chivalry. Balzac once
said: "Hundreds of absurd stories have been made up about the author of
<i>Pantagruel</i>, one of the finest books in French literature.
Rabelais, a sober man who drank nothing but water, is thought of as a
lover of food and drink and a confirmed tippler." The author himself
placed his books in the long line of heroic narratives, starting from
Homer and Virgil. <br>
</p>
      <p>In <i>Rabelais and His World</i> (1968) the Russian theorist of literature, Mikhail M. Bakhtin (1895-1975) introduced the term <i>carnivalesque</i>
to describe those forms of unofficial culture that use laughter,
parody, and "grotesque realism" as a weapon against official culture
and totalitarian order. <a href="auerb.htm">Erich Auerbach</a> wrote in <i>Mimesis</i>
(1946) that the revolutionary thing about Rabelais' way of thinking "is
not his opposition to Christianity, but the freedom of vision, feeling
and thought which his perpetual playing with things produces, and which
invites the reader to deal directly with the world and its wealth of
phenomena. On one point, to be sure, Rabelais takes a stand, and it is
a stand which is basically anti-Christian; for him, the man who follows
his nature is good, and natural life, be it of men or things, is
good..." </p>
