<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Witty and sophisticated American writer and
theater critic, noted for her satirical commentaries on marriage,
intellectuals, and the role of women. McCarthy's novels were often
drawn from autobiographical sources; she put friends, enemies,
ex-husbands, thinly disguised, into her fiction. Her bestselling novel,
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Group</span> (1963), was
about her classmates at Vassar and their subsequent lives. McCarthy's
seven novels appeared between the years 1942 and 1979. Most of her
fiction and nonfiction explored the response of intellectuals to
political and moral problems. McCarthy's attraction to Communism ended
in 1936-37, but in the mid-1960s she re-emerged as a political
essayist, writing against the Vietnam War. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When you have committed an action
that you cannot bear to think about, that causes you to writhe in
retrospect, do not seek to evade the memory: make yourself relive it,
confront it repeatedly over and over, till finally, you will discover,
through sheer repetition it loses its power to pain you. It works, I
guarantee you, this sure-fire guilt-eradicator, like a homeopathic
medicine - like in small doses applied to like. It works, but I am not
sure that it is a good thing."</b> </font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">How I Grew</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Mary McCarthy was born in Seattle, WA. Orphaned at the age of
six, when both her parents died in the great flu epidemic of 1918-1819,
she was brought up by her rigid aunt and uncle in Minneapolis, where
she spent six miserable years, after which her rich grandparents took
care of her. Her virginity McCarthy lost at the age of 14 in the front
seat of a Marmon roadster to a man twice her age. McCarthy was educated
at the Annie Wright Seminary, Tacoma, Washington and Vassar College,
New York, where she studied literature and met Elizabeth Bishop and
Muriel Rukeyser. After graduating with honors aged 21, she married the
first of her husbands, the playwright Harold Johnsrud, and moved to New
York. After the marriage ended, she had a series of affairs, writing
later provocatively that at one point she stopped counting the number
of men she slept with in her Greenwich Village apartment. </p>
      <p>During the 1930s McCarthy was active on the American left,
becoming a Trotskyist and an anti-Stalinist. She worked as an editor in
Covici-Friede publishers in 1936-37, and then coedited with Philip Rahv
      <i>Partisan Review</i> for a short time, and had also an affair
with him. From 1938 to 1962 McCathy wrote theater reviews for <i>PR</i>,
the premier journal of the New York intellectuals; she was also the
only woman of her Vassar friends, who was accepted in the inner circle
of the magazine. </p>
      <p>In 1938 McCarthy married her second husband, the critic Edmund
Wilson (1895-1972), with whom she had her only child. McCarthy was
Wilson's wife number three. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Intellectual
Memoirs</span>
(1992) she confessed, that she never loved him, an "old"
man who was "fat, puffing" and had bad breath. They looked strikingly
different &#8211; McCarthy slim, twenty-five, and Wilson two hundred pounds,
and forty-two, when they met. "So finally I agreed to marry Wilson as
my punishment for having gone to bed with him..." she wrote. Both
became soon experts in attacking each other's weak points. It has been
claimed, that Wilson beat her up in 1938, after which she suffered a
mental breakdown. During World War II, McCarthy began to support the
war effort but Wilson remained skeptical. They divorced in 1946. The
couple lived for several years in Wellfleet, a small community south of
Provincetown on Cape Cod. During her Wellfleet years, McCarthy commuted
regularly to New York City to escape from her husbands overpowering
presence and to meet her lovers. <br>
 </p>
      <p>McCarthy's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Company She Keeps</span> (1942), was a collection of loosely linked
stories. The satire about New York intellectuals depicted the failure
of a marriage, and the search for personal identity through
psychoanalysis. McCarthy herself had a new psychiatrist in the early
1940s, who had been analyzed by Freud. Vladimir Nabokov praised
McCarthy's novel in his letters to her husband. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Oasis</span> (1949) was
a short novel about artists and intellectuals living in a utopian
society. <i>The Group </i>(1963) was a sexually outspoken depiction
of eight Vassar graduates in the 1930s. It followed the group of
friends through their first sexual experiences, marriage, and domestic
duties. Intended to be a partial parody, it portrays women as they
embrace or oppose ideas of political and social progress fashionable in
the 1930s and 1940s. The book was made into a movie in 1966. Comically
titled <span style="font-style: italic;">Birds of America&nbsp;</span>
(1971) focused on a boy whose mother refuses to accept modern
conveniences; gradually the boy understands his mother's views of
"progress". </p>
      <p>McCarthy met in 1944 the philosopher <a href="arendt.htm">Hannah
Arendt</a> in a hotel bar, a year later they quarreled, but eventually
they settled their differences and became dear friends, confidantes,
and devoted correspondents. When Arendt was attacked by the Jewish
community for her book on Adolf Eichmann, McCarthy rushed to her aid
and wrote a defence of her views. Arendt herself was a German-born Jew,
and had subtitled the work "A Report on the Banality of Evil". Their
correspondence was later collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Between
Friends&nbsp;</span> (1995). </p>
      <p>In 1967 McCarthy made trips to South Vietnam, recording her
views of the war in essays in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>.
After visiting Hanoi, McCarthy wrote favorably about the Vietcong. The
two collections of her essays, <span style="font-style: italic;">Report
from Vietnam </span>(1967) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Hanoi</span>
(1968), received less attention than she expected. Years later she
admitted, "My dear, I arrived in Hanoi wearing a Chanel suit, and
carrying many suitcases!" </p>
      <p>Among McCarthy's other publications are critical works, travel
books, and the autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">Memories
of a Catholic Girlhood</span> (1957). As important as her fiction are
criticism and political reporting, such as T<span style="font-style: italic;">he Mask of State: Watergate Portraits</span>
(1971). <span style="font-style: italic;">Cannibals and Missionaries</span>
(1979) was a topical novel about the psychology of terrorism. A plane
carrying Americans, rich art collectors and politicians, is hijacked by
a terrorist. At first the terrorist intends to use the politicians in
the flight as hostages, but then decides to trade the art collectors
for their artworks. "We all know in our gut that art educates. In other
societies, they've aware of the power it has of speaking directly to
the masses, teaching them to better socialists, better citizens. The
trouble is that with us it's fallen into the wrong hands. Forget the
speculators... The concept of the collector is so rotten by now that it
stinks." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Cannibals and
Missionaires</font></i><font size="2">, 1979) </font></p>
      <p>In her essays McCarthy explored a wide range of subjects from
sexual emancipation, communism, nuclear weapons, Vietnam and Watergate
to the work of contemporary playwrights and novelists. "Our
anti-Communism came to us neither as the fruit of a special wisdom nor
as a humiliating awakening from a prolonged deception, but as a natural
event, the product of chance and propinquity. One thing followed
another, and the will had little to say about it. For my part, during
that year, I realized, with a certain wistfulness, that it was too late
for me to become any kind of Marxist. Marxism, I saw, from the learned
young man I listened to at Committee meetings, was something you had to
take up young, like ballet dancing." <font size="2">(from 'My
Confession,' 1954) </font>In one of her most controversial essays,
'America the Beautiful: The Humanist in the Bathtub' (1947), McCarthy
wrote that consumerism has created pseudo-equality, "an equality of
things rather than of persons... We are nation of twenty million
bathrooms, with a humanist in every tub." McCarthy's theatre reviews
were published in 1956 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Sights and Spectacles&nbsp; 1932-1956</span>.
      </p>
      <p>McCathy taught or lectured at Beard College,
Annendale-on-Hudson, New York (1945-1946 and 1986), Sarah Lawrence
College, Bronxville, New York (1948), University College, London
(1980), and Vassar College (1982). From 1962 McCarthy spent with her
fourth husband, James West, half of her time in Paris. </p>
      <p>Much of the last years of McCarthy's life was dominated by her
legal battle with the writer Lillian Hellman. <font size="2"> </font>In
a taped interview with Dick Cavett, first aired in 1980, McCarthy said
about Helman, with only slight hyperbole, that "every word she writes
is alie, including <i>and</i> and<i> the</i>." Hellman's defamation
suit against McCarthy &#8211; she demanded $2.25 million &#8211; was dropped after
Hellman's death in June 1984 on Martha's Vineyard. ''If someone had
told me, don't say anything about Lillian Hellman because she'll sue
you, it wouldn't have stopped me. It might have spurred me on. I didn't
want her to die. I wanted her to lose in court. I wanted her around for
that.'' </p>
      <p>In 1984 McCarthy had an operation to relieve the pressure of
water on her brain. James West once said, that she was "more interested
in ideas than in her health." McCarthy died of cancer in New York
Hospital, on October 25, 1989. She was a member of the American
Academy, National Institute of Arts and Letters. Her several awards
include Edward MacDowell Medal (1982), National Medal of Literature
(1984), and the first Rochester Literary Award (1985). She had honorary
degrees from six universities.</p>
