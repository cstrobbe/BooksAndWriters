<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author, who won the first National Book Award for fiction in 1950 for <em><span class="st">The Man with the Golden Arm</span>
</em>, later made into a film, starring Frank Sinatra. More than any
other city, Chicago inspired Algren, as it was the case with James T.
Farrell, with whom he is often grouped. Algren depicted its drunks,
pimps, prostitutes, freaks, drug addicts, prize-fighters, corrupt
politicians, and hoodlums &#8211; the whole underside of urban life. He also
published poems, essays, and short stories, the best of which include
'A Bottle of Milk for Mother' and 'How the Devil Came Down Division
Street'. His trans-Atlantic love affair with the French writer Simone
de Beauvoir lasted with intervals for 17 years and ended in bitter
accusations. De Beauvoir dedicated her book <i>The Mandarins </i>to Algren, and kept his ring, but never left Jean-Paul Sartre, 
her life's companion, who was no good in bed. 
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The great strength of a fighting man is
his pride. That was Young Rocco's strength in the rounds that followed.
The boy called Kid Class couldn't keep him down. He was down in the
fourth, twice in the fifth, and again in the seventh. In that round he
stood with his back against the ropes, standing the boy off with his
left in the seconds before the bell. He had the trick of looking
impassive when he was hurt, and his face at the bell looked as
impassive as a catcher's mitt." </b></font><font size="2">(in 'He Swung and He Missed,' 1942) </font></blockquote>

<p>Nelson Algren Abraham was born in Detroit, but he grew up in Chicago
in a poor immigrant neighborhood on the South Side, where his parents
moved when he was three. Algren was the youngest of three siblings. His
mother, Goldie, had a candy store, and Gerson Abraham, his father, was
a garage mechanic. Algren's grandfather, whom he never saw, was a
Swedish immigrant, who took the Old Testament at its literal truth,
converted to Judaism and changed his name to Isaac Ben Abraham. "My
father was about two years old and he woke up to find himself in
Jerusalem with a lot of camels. I'm sure he never knew how he got
there, but the first thing he remembered were a lot of camels with
Arabs riding them." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Conversations with Nelson Algren</font></i><font size="2">, 1964) </font></p>
<p>Algren was educated in Chicago's public schools, graduating in 1928. 
He studied journalism at the University of Illinois, taking his B.A. during the 
Depression in 1931. After graduating, Algren went south looking 
for newspaper work and doing odd jobs, including working as a door-to-door 
salesman. He adopted his Swedish grandfather's name and in 1933 he lived 
in a derelict petrol station in Texas. There he wrote his first short 
story, 
'So Help Me', the winner of a 1935 O'Henry Award, which was published later in <i>Story</i> magazine. 
The effort led to a contract and a $100 advance for his first novel. 
In 1934 he was jailed for a month for stealing a typewriter. 
Back in Chicago Algren joined the <a href="johnreed.htm">John Reed Club</a>. He was editor of the <i>New Anvil</i>, an experimental magazine and worked for the Chicago Board of Health. </p>
<p>As a novelist Algren made his debut with <em>Somebody in Boots</em>
(1935), which was based on his experiences in Texas. The book was written
in the classic documentary style of the 1930s and received mixed
reviews. In the middle of the Great Depression it sold a mere 750
copies and the disappointed author was briefly hospitalized. <i>Somebody in Boots</i> contained characters, situations, and locales that later formed the basis for Algren's future works. 
Before his next novel, which appeared in 1942, Algren wrote short stories and worked intermittently on 
the W.P.A. Illinois Writers' Project. <em>Never Come Morning</em>
(1942), a realistic story about poverty and crime, was banned from the
Chicago Public Library. Its first edition contained an introduction by
Richard Wright. The central character, Bruno Bicek, is a small time
hood and aspiring boxer. He cheats and murders, and allows his
girlfriend to be gang-raped. Finally Bicek is betrayed by his own clan
and is sentenced to death for murder. </p>
<p>In 1937 Algren married Amanda Kontowicz, whom he had met at a party
celebrating the publication of his first novel; they divorced,
remarried and divorced again. During WW II Algren served as a private
in an U.S. Army field artillery unit and then as a medical corpsman and
was eventually stationed in France. This experience Algren used in
several of his short stories, which appeared in a wide variety of
publications, starting from <i>Noble Savage</i> to <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Esquire</i>. His best early stories Algren collected in<em> The Neon Wilderness</em> (1947).</p><p>Though
Algren considered himself a Communist during the Great Depression, and
worked for the Communist Party, he was not a card carrying member.
However, the FBI
had a file on him. The file ran to 546 pages, including information
supplied by army and navy intelligence as well as by the State Department. Nothing had changed in Algren's life&nbsp;after
he&nbsp;had published his first novel about the gritty side&nbsp;of
American life &#8211; he lived in poverty and drank heavily. For a period his
financial situation improved when he was aided by a grant from
Chicago's Newberry Library and an award from the American Academy of
Arts and Letters; its members believed that <em>Never Come Morning</em> had not received the recognition it deserved.&nbsp; </p>

<p>During the post-war years Algren started an affair with the French
writer Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre's life-companion. At that
time she shared Sartre with Dolores Vanetti Ehrenreich, once the
mistress of the surrealist poet André Breton. Dolores lived in New
York, where Sartre had decided to spend a few months every year with
her. Beauvoir made a lecture tour in the United States in 1947 and the
two writers met through an introduction arranged by Mary Guggenheim.
"On train to Los Angeles I read one of his books and thought about
him," de Beauvoir later wrote, "he lived in a hovel, without a bathroom
or a refrigerator, alongside an alley full of steaming trash cans and
flapping newspapers, this poverty seemed refreshing, after the heavy
odour of the dollars in the big hotels and the elegant restaurants,
which I found hard to take." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">A Transatlantic Love Affair</font></i><font size="2">, 1998) </font><font size="3">Algren
showed Beauvour Chicago's underside, introduced her to stickup men,
pimps, baggage thieves, whores and heroin&nbsp;addicts. &nbsp;He was
the first man with whom Beauvoir ever had an orgasm. On every day they
met, they slept together. </font></p>
<p>Algren and de Beauvoir traveled in Latin America, and in 1949 Algren met Sartre in Paris. 
("Procurers," he Algren once said, "are more honest than philosophers"). 
Sartre helped to translate 
<i>Never Come Morning</i> and parts of <i>Chicago</i> into
French.&nbsp;His affair with Beauvoir broke down after five years,
but&nbsp;in 1960,&nbsp;when Algren met her in Seville, they&nbsp;went
together to Istanbul, Crete, and Athens. Their relationship turned sour
again after the publication of the third part of her autobiography, <i>Force of Circumstance</i> (1963).&nbsp;
Algren&nbsp; believed that marriage is founded on love and commitment,
but Beauvoir dismissed sexual fidelity as "often preached, seldom
practiced . . ."</p><p>Beauvoir&nbsp;wrote him some 350 letters, in
English. Though Algren had served in the Army in France, he spoke no
French and was never willing to learn the language. He also knew that
Beauvour would never settle with him in Chicago and have his baby.
However, she referred to him as "my beloved husband."&nbsp; De
Beauvoir, who died in 1986, was buried wearing his ring. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"At first, I had found it amusing meeting
in the flesh that classic American species: self-made leftist writer.
Now, I began taking an interest in Brogan. Through his stories, you got
the feeling that he claimed no rights on life and that nevertheless he
had always had a passionate desire to live. I liked that mixture of
modesty and eagerness."</b> (Simone de Beauvoir in </font><i><font size="2">The Mandarins</font></i><font size="2">, 1957; dedicated to Nelson Algren, who is Lewis Bogan in the novel)</font></blockquote>
<p>Algren made his breakthrough at the age of 41 with <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i>
(1949). Otto Preminger's film adaptation from 1956 was a sensation with
its cold turkey scenes. The protagonist is Frankie Machine, a WWII
veteran and stud-poker dealer, who fights against his drug addiction in the
world of junkies, drunks, and petty thieves, and finally kills himself.
"Neither God, war, nor the ward super work any deep change on West
Division Street," wrote Algren. The work received the National Book
Award and Algren was invited to Hollywood to write the screenplay. The
experience was disastrous and Algren sued the film's producer, Otto
Preminger. Sinatra decided to accept the role when Marlon Brando still
hesitated. Though the&nbsp;film made money, Algren<strong> </strong>profited
nothing. "I am the&nbsp;tin whistle of American letters," he once said.
Sinatra received a nomination for Best Actor; the Oscar went to Ernest
Borgine for his performance in <em>Marty</em>. </p>
<p><span class="st"><em>Chicago: City on the Make</em></span>&nbsp;(1951) was a book that the Chicago Chamber of Commerce did not like because Algren's essay presented 
the back alleys of the town and the state, not only its thriving business world. Studs Terkel, Algren's close friend, wrote 
the introduction for the reissue edition of 1987. </p>

<p><em>A <span class="st">Walk on the Wild Side</span></em>, a comic
novel, which came out in 1956, was hailed as a masterpiece. It depicts
with black humour a drifter in the Depression era, who gets involved
with prostitutes, pimps and con men in the old French Quarter of 1930s.
"The book asks why lost people sometimes develop into greater human beings
than those who have never been lost in their whole lives," explained
Algren. The $25,000, which he received for the film rights, he spent
the fast. The genesis of the story was the author's earlier work, <i>Somebody in Boots</i>. As before, the critics were divided and Algren was hospitalized for a short time &#8211; he had tried to commit suicide.
</p>
<p>Algren married Betty Ann Jones in 1965; they divorced two years
later. He taught creative writing at the universities of Iowa and
Florida, regularly wrote a column for the <i>Chicago Free Press</i>,
and continued his self-destructive life, heavy drinking, and gambling.
When the&nbsp;American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters&nbsp;awarded him the&nbsp;medal for Literature,
Algren refused to travel to the ceremony in New York City, saying:
"I'm sorry, but I have to speak at a ladies' garden club that day." </p><p>In 1974 Algren settled in Paterson, New Jersey, and wrote <em>The Devil's Stocking</em>,
his fourth novel, which was published posthumously in 1983. It was
based on the life of the prizefighter Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, who was
tried and imprisoned for murder. Carter spent 19 years in prison. He
was freed in 1985. "... the character of Carter himself has been
transmogrified into Ruby Calhoun, a protagonist who grows in complexity
as the action proceeds, until he becomes a fully realized,
multidimensional tragic personage in a narrative that has all the vital
signs of having been produced by a writer still fully confident of his
inventive powers."<font size="2"> </font><font size="2">(</font><font size="2">John W. Aldridge in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">October 9, 1983)</font>
Bob Dylan's song 'Hurricane' and Norman Jewison's film from 1999 also
dealt with Carter's fate. "An innocent man in a living hell / That's
the story of the Hurricane," sang Dylan in 1975. Algren wrote a feature
for <span style="font-style: italic;">Esquire</span> suggesting Carter's innocence, but the magazine rejected it.<br>
 </p>
<p>Algren moved to Long Island in September 1980.&nbsp;His literary
friends included&nbsp; Betty Friedan, William Gaddis, Joe
Pintauro,&nbsp;Irwin Shaw, and Kurt Vonnegut. Financially, he lived a
very meager life. He had a small income from&nbsp;the German
publication of his books.&nbsp;&nbsp;Embittered by the success of
others,&nbsp;he concluded in an interview that "James Jones gets
three-quarters of a million dollars, Algren gets a free train-ride to
New York." Algren died of a heart attack on May 9, 1981,&nbsp; in Sag
Harbor, New York. A few weeks earlier he had been elected to membership
in the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. The city of
Chicago changed West Evergreen Street to West Algren Street, but after
complaints of the residents the city changed it back again. </p>
