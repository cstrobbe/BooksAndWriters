      <p>Anglo-Irish poet, critic, and educator. Cecil Day-Lewis was
appointed Poet Laureate in 1968. He also gained fame as a detective
story writer under the name Nicholas Blake. In sixteen of his twenty
mystery novels the hero was Nigel Strangeways, an Oxford graduate. It
is told that the primary model was the writer <a href="whauden.htm">W.H.
Auden</a>. Lewis was married twice and fathered five children, one of
whom is the Academy Award-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Nigel's six feet sprawled all over
the place; his gestures were nervous and little uncouth; a lock of
sandy coloured hair dropping over his forehead, and the deceptive
naïveté of his face in repose gave him a resemblance to an overgrown
prep. schoolboy. His eyes were the same blue as his uncle's, but
shortsighted and noncommittal. Yet there was an underlying similarity
between the two. A latent, sardonic humor in their conversation, a
friendliness and simple generosity in their smiles, and that impression
of energy in reserve which is always given by those who possess an
abundance of life directed towards consciously-realised aims."</b>
(from </font><i><font size="2">Thou Shell of Death</font></i><font size="2">, 1936) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Cecil Day-Lewis was born at Ballintubber, Queen's County (now
county Laois), Ireland, the son of Reverend Frank Cecil Day-Lewis, an
ordained priest of the Church of Ireland, and Kathleen Blake Squires.
The family moved to England in 1905. After his mother died, he was
brought up in London by his father, with the help of an aunt, Agnes;
she was unmarried and was known to the young Cecil as Knos. </p>
      <p>Day-Lewis went to Wilkie's Prep School in London and to
Sherborne School in Dorset. Before leaving Sherbone, he had begun to
write poetry. In 1927 he graduated from Wadham College, Oxford. While
in Oxford he became part of the circle that gathered around W.H. Auden
and helped him to edit <i>Oxford Poetry 1927</i>. Its preface was
written by both of them in alternating paragraphs. Day-Lewis's own
first collection, <span style="font-style: italic;">Beechen Virgil</span>
(1925), was privately printed, but his poems had appeared in the
anthology <i>Ten Singers</i>, published in October 1924. However, he
did not include any of these pieces, which reveal the influence of
Yeats, in the several <i>Selected Poems</i> and <i>Collected Poems</i>
he published during his lifetime. In 1928 Day-Lewis married Mary King, the daughter of a master
at Sherborne. They had two sons. After graduation, he worked as a
schoolmaster. Due to compassionate poems which he had addressed to his
wife and collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Transitional
Poems</span> (1929) he nearly lost his job at Cheltenham Junior School.
 </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Tempt me no more, for I </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Have known the lightning's hour, </font><br>
        <font size="2">The poet's inward pride, </font><br>
        <font size="2">The certainty of power. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Tempt Me No More') </font></blockquote>
      <p>In his youth Day-Lewis adopted communist views. As an act of
rebellion, he also removed the hyphen in his name, but reinstated it
later in life. Some of his early poems have a strong political and
didactic subtex. Along with writers such as W.H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, and Stephen Spender, Day-Lewis
was under the surveillance of the Security Service (MI5) and other
branches of British intelligence. Following the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War, Day-Lewis planned to go to Spain and join the International
Brigade, but as he later confessed, he "lacked the courage to do so."
From the late 1930s, he grew increasingly
disillusioned with the Communist Party, which he evetually renounced.
To cut himself off all contacts with the Party, he moved to the village
of Musbury near the Devon border &#8211; there was "no Party group within
many miles." <br>
</p>
      <p>A new turn in Day-Lewis's career occured in 1935, when he decided to supplement
his income from poetry by writing a detective novel. His agent advised
him to separate the roles of detective novelist and poet. Thus he
created Nigel Strangeways, the hero of sixteen of his twenty books, who
was named after the former name of the HM Prison Manchester. The first
novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> A Question of Proof</span>,
published under the pseudonym Nicholas Blake, was written to pay for
the repair of a leaky roof. For Day-Lewis's surprise, it became a
selection of the Crime Club and eventually was followed by nineteen
more crime novels. From the mid-1930s Day-Lewis was able to earn his
living by writing. A liaison with the wife of a local farmer resulted
in the birth of a son. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'Well, I've not been in jail yet. I
did get fined for sitting in Trafalgar Square. It was one of those
Committee of a Hundred picnics.' </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">'I see. You believe in unilateral disarmament?' </font><br>
        <font size="2">'Every sensible person does.' Cherry took a deep
breath, about to launch on a political speenc, but Sparkes forestalled
her. </font><br>
        <font size="2">'Would you say that betraying your country's
secrets to an enemy advanced the cause of nuclear disarmament?' </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Ask Me Another</font></i><font size="2">, 1964) </font></blockquote>
      <p>By the end of the decade Day-Lewis was living in Devon. He had
published several collections of poems under the influence of Auden,
among others <span style="font-style: italic;">From Feathers to
Iron&nbsp;</span> (1932), <span style="font-style: italic;">Collected
Poems </span>(1935), and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Time to
Dance and Other Poems </span>(1935).
From 1941 he worked at the
Ministry of Information as an editor in the publication department.
Still regarded as a communist propagandist, he was not allowed to speak
on radio, but he provided ad hoc scripts for the BBC and his Nicholas
Blake detective radio play <span style="font-style: italic;">Calling James Braithwaite</span> was broadcast in July 1940. At
the end of the war Day-Lewis joined the publisher Chatto&amp;Windus as a
director and senior editor. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Word
Over All</span> (1943) Day-Lewis distanced him from Auden and reached
his full stature as a writer. Many of the following works reflected his
personal life, extramarital affairs, and the turbulent nine-year
relationship with the novelist Rosamond Lehmann. </p>
      <p>In 1951 Day-Lewis married actress Jill Balcon, the daughter of
the film mogul Sir Michael Balcon. She was 21 years his junior; he was
the greatest love of her life. They had two children, Tamasin and
Daniel. The couple settled in a large Georgian house in Greenwich. A
few years after the marriage, when he was working for
Chatto&amp;Windus, he had a brief affair with Elizabeth Jane Howard, a
young writer, who left him. A poem from this period, entitled 'Moods of
Love', expressed his anger and frustration: "Better a brutal twitching
of the reins And off, than this devouring pious whore Who in soft
regret will twine you fast Where thigh-bones mope along the tainted
shore And crazed beachcombers pick over their past. ..." Howard married
the novelist <a href="amis">Kingsley Amis</a> in 1965. </p>
      <p>Day-Lewis was professor of poetry at Oxford in 1951-56, and a
lecturer in the 1950s and 1960s at several universities. During a
fruitful time at Harvard in 1964-5, where he held the Charles Eliot
Norton Chair, he wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">On Not Saying
Anything </span>(1964). In succession to John Masefield he was
appointed Poet Laureate in 1968. Day-Lewis was chairman of the Arts
Council Literature Panel, vice-president of the Royal Society of
Literature, Honorary Member of the American Academy, Member of the
Irish Academy of Letters. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Day-Lewis died from cancer, on May 22, 1972, in the
Hertfordshire home of Kingsley Amis and Elisabeth Jane Howard, where he
and his wife were staying. A great admirer of Thomas Hardy, he had
arranged that he should be buried as close as possible to the author's
grave in Stinsford churchyard. <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Whispering Roots</span> (1970) was the last volume published in his
lifetime. 'The Expulsion' (1972), which appeared in a Festschrift for
W.H. Auden's 68th birthday in a limited edition, was inspired by
Masaccio's frescoes in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence. Day-Lewis saw
them for the first time on a convalescence holiday in 1970. "Masaccio
paints us both A childish tragedy &#8211; hunched back, bawling mouth, And
the hour when the animal knew that it must die And with that stroke put
on humanity." Upon reading the typescrift, the sculptor Henry Moore
told that he had learned something new about the fresco.</p>
      <p>Day-Lewis's early mystery novels are full of literary
references, from Shakespeare to Blake, Keats, Arthur Hugh Clough and
A.E. Housman. <i>A Question of Proof </i> was set in similar
preparatory school milieu, where he was teaching at the time. <span style="font-style: italic;">Head of a Traveller</span> (1949) was
dedicated to Rosamond Lehmann's children. Among Day-Lewis's best
mysteries are <span style="font-style: italic;">The Beast Must Die </span>(1938),
a story of a father seeking revenge on the hit and run driver who
killed his child, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Case of the
Abominable Snowman </span>(1941), <span style="font-style: italic;">A
Tangled Web</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> (1956),
based on a real murder case, and <span style="font-style: italic;">End
of Chapter</span> (1957). </p>
      <p>Nigel Strangeways, the series detective, is an Oxford
graduate, six feet tall, blue eyed, always at the disposal of Inspector
Blount of Scotland Yard, the British Secret Service, and his many
friends. In <i>Thou Shell of Death</i> Stangeways meets and marries
explorer Georgia Cavendish, but after WW II he continues as a widower.
During the years, Nigel Strangeways ages and changes, and sees the
world less idealistically. </p>
      <p>The critic and award-winning mystery writer H.R.F. Keating
included in 1987 <i>The Beast Must Die </i>among the 100 best crime
and mystery books ever published. Day Lewis's own son was almost run
over in a circumstance similar to that which the story describes. It
begins with the promise: "I am going to kill a man... I have no idea
what he looks like. But I am going to find him and kill him." The title
of the story was taken from the text of Brahm's Four Serious Songs, a
paraphrase of the Book of Ecclesiastes: "The beast must die, the man
dieth also, yea both must die." </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Private Wound&nbsp;</span>
(1968) concerns the problems that divide Ireland, and was considered
the most autobiographical of the author's works in the mystery genre. <span style="font-style: italic;">Thou Shell of Death&nbsp; </span>(1936)
was a contemporary version of Cyril Tourneur's gory 1607 play, <i>The
Revenger's Tragedy</i>. Day-Lewis's best-known children's book is<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Otterbury Incident</span> (1948), a
story of a group of kids, who outwit criminals. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Dick Willoughby</span> (1933) Day-Lewis
depicted the life of a young Elizabethan, adding into his adventures
secret tunnels, sword-play, an evil Catholic kinsman, and an innocent
romance. </p>
