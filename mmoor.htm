<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning American poet, highly esteemed by her fellow
colleagues. Moore's often-quoted advice in 'Poetry' was that poets
should present for inspection "imaginary gardens with real toads in
them". Characteristic for her works is cryptic zigzag logic, eccentric
rhythms, and ironic wit. Her best-known poems feature animals and are
written in precise, clear language. Moore was a friend to many of the
greatest artists and writers of the 20th century, such as T.S. Eliot,
Ezra Pound, Elizabeth Bishop, and E.E. Cummings. </p>

<p>Marianne Moore was born near St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of
John Milton Moore, an engineer-inventor. Moore was brought up with her
brother in the home of her grandfather, the Reverend John R. Warner,
the pastor of Kirkwood Presbyterian Church. John Milton suffered a
mental breakdown before her daughter's birth and
was committed to a psychiatric hospital; she never met him. In 1896 the
family moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where Moore's mother, Mary
Warner, worked as a teacher at the Metzger Institute, a private girls's
school. </p>
<p>Moore was not an outstanding student at Bryn Mawr College in
Pennsylvania, but she was popular, active in the social life, and
contributed to the student literary magazine, the <i>Tipyn O'Bob </i>or <i>Tip</i>.
Among her friends were Peggy James, daughter of psychologist William
James, and Frances Browne, with whom she traveled to Europe in the
1960s. During her college years Moore considered herself primarily as a
writer of prose. At early age, she had wanted to be a painter. Her
first odes and sonnets Moore composed when she was seven. Moore
graduated in 1909 with a degree in biology and histology. She taught
typing and bookkeeping for four years at the U.S. Industrial Indian
School in Carlisle. One of her pupils was the famous Native American
athlete, Jim Thorpe. </p>
<p>In 1911 Moore spent a summer in England and France. Her first poems 
appeared in <i>The Egoist</i><i></i>, an English periodical, and Alfred 
Kreymborg's <i>Others</i>
in 1915. In Greenwich Village at Kreymborg's apartment she met such
young avant-garde poets as Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams.
After living in Chatham, New Jersey, with her mother, she returned in
1918 to New York City, again with her mother. From 1919 she devoted
herself to writing, working initially as a secretary, private tutor and
library assistant at the Hudson Park branch of the New York Public
Library. Her home was at 14 St. Lukes Place. </p>
<p>Moore's  first book,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Poems</span>, appeared in London in 1921, when she was 
34. It was published without her knowledge by two of her friends, Hilda 
Doolittle and Robert McAlmon. <i>Poems </i>was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Marriage</span> (1923) 
and   <span style="font-style: italic;">Observations</span> (1924), which   won the  <i>Dial</i>
Award for "distinguished service to American letters". T.S. Eliot noted
her work early and wrote in 1923: "I can only think of five
contemporary poets &#8211; English, Irish, French and German &#8211; whose works
excite me as much or more than Miss Moore's." These works contain some
of her best-known poems, including 'To Steam Roller', 'The Fish', 'When
I Buy Pictures', 'Peter', 'The Labors of Hercules' and 'Poetry'. In <i>Observations </i>Moore brought to her verse the rhythm of prose; she also avoided the rhyme in about half of its poems. </p>

<p>In 1925 she became an acting editor of <i>The Dial</i>, an influential
American journal of literature and arts, where she worked until the journal
was discontinued in 1929 for financial reasons. During these years she published texts from such writers as Paul Valery, <a href="/tseliot.htm">T.S. Eliot</a>, who admired her language, Hart Crane, <a href="/epound.htm">Ezra Pound</a>, and Ortega y Gasset. The closing down of <i>Dial</i> was a severe blow to Moore's career as a critic, although he continued to publish essays on diverse subjects. Moore's <span style="font-style: italic;">Selected Poems</span>
(1935) was highly praised by Eliot, who wrote in the Introduction: "My
conviction, for what it is worth, had remained unchanged for the last
fourteen years: that Miss Moore's poems form part of the small body of
durable poetry written in our time." Moore's correspondence with Eliot
began in 1921 and continued until 1964. </p>

<p>As several other writers in her time, Moore was interested in
the creative process and the relation between  expression and real 
things. Moore remained critical toward her own work. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Complete Poems</span>
from 1967 opened with the dictum: "Omissions are not accidents." In one
poem she stated: "If eternal action if effete / and rhyme is outmoded,
/ I shall revert to you / Habakkuk, as on a recent occasion I was
goaded / into doing by XY, who was speaking of unrhymed / verse."
Moore's poetry is marked by an unconventional but disciplined
use of metrics. Her poems have been compared to Picasso's cubist
portraits &#8211; she moved swiftly from image to image. Sometimes she used
pseudo-scholarly language or referred to art history, music, and to
current affairs: "Dürer would have seen a reason for living / in a town
like this, with eight stranded whales / to look at; with the sweet sea
air coming into your house / on a fine day, from water etched / with
waves as formal as the scales / on a fish."<font size="2"> (from 'The Steeple-Jack, revised, 1961 ) </font>Among
her favorite subjects are exotic animals, which she also described in
the essay 'What There is to See at the Zoo' (1987): "The zoo shows us
that privacy is a fundamental need of all animals. For considerable
periods, animals in the zoo will remain out of sight in the quiet of
their dens or houses. Glass, recently installed in certain parts of the
snake house at the Bronx Zoo makes it possible to see from the outside,
but not out from the inside." </p>
<p>World War II deepened Moore's personal world view which was
fundamentally religious in nature &#8211; she was a lifelong member of the
Presbyterian Church. Her brother John was a Presbyterian minister. In
the foreword to <span style="font-style: italic;">The Marianne Moore Reader&nbsp;</span>
(1961) she wrote: "My favorite poem? asked not too aggressively &#8211;
perhaps recalling that Henry James could not name his 'favorite letter
of the alphabet or wave of the sea.' The Book of Job, I have sometimes
thought..." Acceptance of the human lot is seen in her collection<span style="font-style: italic;"> What Are Years?</span> (1941). Her tragic identification with the world of pain reflected from <span style="font-style: italic;">Nevertheless</span> (1944). Her mother, who died in 1947, appears to have been Moore's closest friend, and her death affected her deeply. <i>Collected poems </i>Moore
dedicated to her mother. She also kept a notebook of her mother's
sayings, and regarded her as almost a collaborator, especially with the
translation of <i>The Fables of La Fontaine. </i> </p>

<p>Moore's later books include the Pulitzer Prize-winning <span style="font-style: italic;">Collected Poems </span>(1951), which was also awarded the National Book Award (1952) and the Bollingen Prize in 1953,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Predilections </span>(1955), a volume of critical papers, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Idiosyncrasy and Technique: Two Lectures </span>(1958).
Moore's influence is seen in such writers as Elizabeth Bishop, Randall
Jarell, Richard Wilbur and Robert Lowell. When the aspiring young poet
Sylvia Plath meet her in 1955, she saw Moore as "someone's fairy
godmother incognito." Marianne Moore died in New York City on February
5, 1972. She was a prolific letter-writer &#8211; producing sometimes up to
50 letters a day at the height of her career. With Ezra Pound she
corresponded from the late 1910s until 1968. Among her friends, beyond
the literary world, were the Museum of Modern Art Curator Monroe
Wheeler, the artist Edward McKnight Kauffer, the dance patron and
writer Lincoln Kirstein, the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, the artist
and sculptor Joseph Cornell, the artist George Plank, the painter Loren
MacIver, the sculptor Malvina Hoffman, and Mrs. Hildegarde Watson,
whose husband was the joint-owner of <i>The Dial</i>. Although Moore
wrote about fashion in her letters, she said, "Style is basic and does
not change with the year." She had a slender figure, her red hair was
tightly braided, and in paintings and photograps she often wore a large
hat, a straight-cut suit jacket, scarf or necktie, and a skirt. </p>

the 'eight-shaped stitch with which the outer leather is drawn tight on
a baseball'. - - - Moore, who never married, was said to have been
intensely jealous of Eliot's second marriage in 1957.&nbsp;</font> </blockquote>
