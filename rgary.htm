<p>French writer, who won the Critics Prize with his first work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Éducation européenne</span>
(1945, Forest of Anger). This modern variation of the traditional novel
of a young man's coming of age, bought Gary immediate acclaim. The
novel was later revised and reissued in English as <i>Nothing Important Ever Dies </i>(1960). Its hero is a 14-year-old boy who joins the Resistance in Poland under German occupation. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There was a new school of transcendental
abstraction is Paris; its adepts stood in front of an empty canvas with
imaginary brush in their hand, going through a pantomime of the act of
painting, thus expression their absolute rejection of all compromise
with being and matter, including that of art itself, and one of their
works had been bought for fifteen thousand dollars by the Twentieth
Century Museum in Geneva, a perfect illustration of Malraux's Voices of
Silence."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Ski Bum</font></i><font size="2">, 1965) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>Details of the author's childhood are vague. In his book of memoir, <i>Promise at Dawn </i>(1960),
Gary mentions that he never found out about his father, and his mother
talked French with a heavy Russian accent. Absolute truth did not
interest Gary, and in his memoir he said: "Then there is Merzavka, the
god of Absolute Truth and Total Righteousness, the lord of all true
believers and bigots; whip in hand, a Cossack's fur cap over one eye,
he stands in a heap of corpses, the eldest of our lords and masters,
since time immemorial the most respected and obeyed, since the dawn of
history he has had us killed, tortured and oppressed in the name of
Absolute Truth, Religious Truth, Political Truth, Moral Truth..." </p>
<p>According to some sources, Gary was born in Moscow, but it is
possible that he was born in Kursk, or in Vilna, now Vilnius,
Lithuania, the son of a Russian father, who abandoned his family, and a
French mother &#8211; however, his mother's background could have been
Russian. According to some sources, she was a Russian Jew from Kursk.
Her first or second husband was Ledja Kacew. From the age of 14, Gary
lived with his mother, Nina Owczinski, in France, where he was
educated. Before studying law in Aix-en-Provence and Paris, he earned a
French baccalaureate. In 1935, he published two short stories under the
influence of Malraux, 'L'orage', about a failed marriage, and 'Une
petite femme', set in Indochina, in the French paper <i>Gringoire</i>. As Kacew he also wrote an unpublished manuscript entitle <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Vin des morts</span>. 
The notorious paper had a strong anti-Semitic policy, but nearly a million readers. </p>
<p>During the World War II, Gary served as a pilot with the Free French Forces in Europe, and in North Africa, 
where his unit fought against Rommel's forces. In Syria Gary contracted typhoid and near Lagos he crashed his 
plane. Between 1943 and 1944 Gary flew many missions over France, Belgium, and Holland, and received after the 
war the Croix de Guerre and the Legion of Honor. His first book, <i>L&#8217;Éducation européenne</i>, 
Gary completed in England. An English translation appeared in 1944, entitled <i>Forest of Anger</i>.
His name, Romain Kacew, Gary changed first into Romain Gari, but soon
anglicized it. Upon his return to Paris, Gary married the English
author and journalist Lesley Blanch; they divorced officially in 1963
and Gary married the American actress Jean Seberg, born in 1938. A well
known and celebrted couple, they dined with the Kennedys and lunched at
the Élysee with de Gaulle, whose faithful supporter Gary remained
throughout his life. He even wrote an article which lashed the public
mind for abandoning the President in 1969. At de Gaulle's funeral in
1970 Gary wore his Free French air force uniform. In the U.S., Seberg
became politically active, supporting Civil Rights Movement. Until her
death, she was persecuted by the F.B.I. </p>
<p>After the war Gary was in the French diplomatic service for 20 years. He served at Sofia, Berne, 
as First Secretary of the French Delegation to the United Nations (1956-1960), and as a 
consul in Los Angeles. During this period he remained mostly as an outsider to the intense debate about 
the Algerian war, although he published in <i>Life</i> an article, that annoyed both Gaullists and 
Leftists. Upon his return to France, Gary became friends with Dominique Ponchardier, 
de Gaulle's bodyguard and an undercover agent, who formed an anti-OAS group. 
In the 1967-68 government of Georges Pompidou, he worked under Georges Gorse, minister of information, but 
resinged in May 1968, in support of the students. A regular or even intermittent traveller, Gary 
also lived in South Africa and then in Paris. </p>

<p>Gary wrote his works both in French and in English; the French are considered better. <span style="font-style: italic;">La Danse de Gengis Cohn</span> (1967) was a tragi-comic novel about the ghost of a Jewish stand-up comedian who takes possession of his Nazi executioner. <i>Roots of Heaven</i>
(1956), was set in Africa. The story of the inhuman aspects of progress
and greed won the Prix Goncourt and was adapted for the screen in 1958.
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Lady L</span> (1959) was a social satire. Originally <span style="font-style: italic;">Lady L</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Talent Scout </span>(1961, Les Mangeurs d'étoiles), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ski Bum</span>
(1965) were written and published in English, and then secretly
translated by a senior editor at Gary's French publishing house. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1968 the Cinema Control Commission asked for a ban on Romain Gary's film <i>Les Oiseaux vont mourir au Pérou </i>(The Birds Come to Die in Peru). George Gorse authorized the release. <span style="font-style: italic;">Chien blanc</span> (1970),  filmed by Samuel Fuller in 1982 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">White Dog</span>,
was a commentary on racism and politics. In the story a dog is trained
to attack blacks only. The film was banned in many countries, including
the U.S. The original story appeared in <span style="font-style: italic;">Life</span>
magazine. After seven or eight scripts, Fuller was called in to direct.
"Romain Gary wrote an allegory or parable which was an autobiography of
his own life, the life of his wife, Jean Seberg, and the Black Panthers
situation," Fuller explained later in an interview. <br>
 </p>


<p>Labelled as a commercial author, in spite of his Fidel Castro beard and such experimental novels as <i>The Dance of Gengis Cohn</i>,  (1968), and <span style="font-style: italic;">La Tête coupableEuropa</span> (1972), Gary felt that professional critics did not truly know his work, 
but mocked them in personal terms. 
As Émile Ajar Gary published four novels, of which <span style="font-style: italic;">La Vie devant soi</span> (1976) also won him the Goncourt award. 
Others were <span style="font-style: italic;">Gros-Câlin</span> (1974), <span style="font-style: italic;">Pseudo</span> (1976), and <span style="font-style: italic;">L&#8217;Angoisse du roi Salomon</span> (1979). Ajar's style was 
elliptical, he refused to grant interviews, and his novels were greeted with applause by influential critics.  
When the secret of the mysterious Ajar was revealed after Gary's death, one reviewer stated, that "Gary was and could be 
recognized as a great writer and master of language, <i>but not under his own name</i>."  

As Fosco Sinibaldi he wrote a novel titled <span style="font-style: italic;">L&#8217;Homme à la colombe</span> (1984) about the inefficiency of the 
United Nations. </p><p>
</p><p>Gary met Seberg in 1959 and nine months later Seberg divorced her husband. 
She had started her career in the U.S. in 
<i>Saint Joan</i> (1957), but brought then vitality and emotional appeal to French movies of the early 
sixties. Her films included <i>Bonjour tristesse </i>(1958), <i>A bout de souffle</i> (1960), <i>In 
the French Style</i> (1962), <i>Lilith</i> (1964), <i>Paint Your Wagon</i> (1969), <i>Airport</i> (1969), 
<i>L'attentat</i> (1972), <i>The Wild Duck</i> (1976). Generally Seberg looked better in French films 
than those of Hollywood.

Displeased with movies made from his books, 
Gary directed <i>Birds in Peru </i>(1969), based on his story and starring his wife Jean Seberg. 
Shortly afterward the film was finished their marriage ended in separation. However, they 
maintained a friendship. </p>
<p>Seberg, who never fully recovering 
from the loss of her infant daughter (most likely fathered by Gary),  committed suicide with barbiturates in 1979. 
Her body was found in the back of a car. 
She had disappeared from her home a week before. Earlier, on returning from filming in Guyana, 
Seberg attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself in front of a subway train. 
Romain Gary shot himself in Paris, on December 2, 1980. </p>
