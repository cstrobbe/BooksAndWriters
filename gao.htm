<p>Chinese novelist, translator, dramatist, director, critic and
artist, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000. His
controversial plays combine elements from ancient masked drama with
influences from Western modernism, represented by such writers as
Artaud, Brecht and Beckett. Gao Xingjian's career as a writer was
stopped in China when he wrote a play set against the background of the
Tiananmen Square massacre. From the late 1980s Gao Xingjian has lived
in France. He holds French citizenship and writes as fluently in French
as in Chinese. </p><blockquote><p><font size="2"><strong>Girl: There are things you can explain, and there are things you can't. Don't you know that?<br>Man: Of course I do, but I still want to know about love.<br>Girl: What a fool! <br>Man: Then go find yourself someone who isn't.<br></strong>(in <em>Dialogue and Rebuttal</em>, 1992)</font></p></blockquote>
<p>Gao Xingjian was born in Ganzhou (Jiangxi province) in eastern
China. His father was a bank official and his mother an amateur
actress, a member of a Y.M.C.A. theater troupe before the Communist
Revolution, and an avid reader of Western literature. As a child Gao
was encouraged to paint, write and play the violin. </p><p>Gao studied
French literature at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute between
1957-1962, taking a degree in French and literature. While in collage,
he became a member of the&nbsp;drama society. &nbsp;After graduating he
worked as a translator for the journal <em>China Reconstructs</em>. </p><p>In
the early 1960s, Gao's mother was sent to the countryside, where she
drowned in an accident, and Gao was forced into farm labor. During the
Cultural Revolution (1966-76), Gao served for a period as the leader of
a Red Guard brigade, but eventually he was sent to a re-education camp
because of his learning. He had started to write for himself, but
fearing the consequences the aspiring writer burned a suitcase full of
manuscripts, including novels, plays and articles, and spent six years
at hard labor in the fields. "I've always had this obsession with
writing," Gao Xingjian has told. "It's what caused my suffering and
misfortune in China, but I'm not about to stop. Even during the most
difficult times in China, I carried on writing secretly, without
thinking that one day I would get published." </p>
<p>After surviving cadre school Gao Xingjian was sent to southwestern
China as a schoolteacher. For a short time he worked as a translator in
the Chinese Writers Association and&nbsp;at the age of 38&nbsp;he
published his first novella, entitled <em>Hanye zhong de xingchen</em>
(Stars on a Cold Night). The first opportunity to travel abroad opened
for him in 1979 and he visited France and Italy. In 1981 he became a
resident playwright at the People's Art Theatre in Beijing, China's
foremost theatre company. </p><p>Between the years 1980 and 1988 Gao
Xingjian published a prolifical stream of plays, short stories, essays,
critiques, and his translations of Jacques Prévert's <em>Paroles</em> (1984) and <a href="ionesco.htm">Eugene Ionesco</a>'s <em>La Cantatrice chauve</em> (1985). <em>Chezhan</em> (Bus Stop), written for the company, was first politely declined due to its non-realistic tendencies. Following the spirit of <a href="beckett.htm">Beckett</a>'s <em>Waiting for Godot</em>
the story told&nbsp; about a group of people have been waiting for the
right bus for some ten years. The play was called when it opened as
"the most pernicious work since the establishment of the People's
Republic" and condemned by Communist Party officials.&nbsp;</p><p>The publication of <i>A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction</i>
(1981), based on ideas taken from the French structuralist school,
&nbsp;led to a heated debate about "spiritual pollution" and Gao was
put under surveillance. <em>Juedui xinhao</em> (1982, Absolute
Signal), a prodigal son tale,&nbsp;marked the&nbsp;breakthrough of
Chinese experimental theatre. Accused of being anti-socialist,&nbsp;the
production&nbsp;was stopped after thirteen performances. Gao Xingjian
was barred from publication for one year and he went into self-exile in
the mountains of southwest China. Upon returning to Beijing, he
finished <em>Yeren</em> (Wilderness Man) in ten days. This politically
uncontroversial&nbsp;play&nbsp; dealing&nbsp;with&nbsp;the history of
manking was favourably received. </p><p>In 1986 Gao Xingjian's<em> Bi'an</em>&nbsp;(The
Other Shore),&nbsp;about manipulating the collective
consciousness,&nbsp;was immediately banned but performed in Taiwan and
Hong Kong. Allowed to travel abroad as a painter, he left China and
settled in Paris, where he continued to write in Chinese and in French.
After the massacre on the Square of Heavenly Peace in 1989&nbsp;Gao
Xingjian&nbsp;broke with&nbsp;the Chinese Communist Party. When he
publicly condemned the acts against the student movement, he also
closed the door to his home country. He dealt later with the massacre
in the play <em>Taowang</em> (Exile), in<em> </em>which three
characters, a young man, a young girl, and a middle-agen
writer,&nbsp;run away from the pursuing People's Liberation Army
soldiers. Originally it was written for a performing-arts center in Los
Angeles, but then rejected. Eventually the play premiered in Swedish in
1992 at the Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern in Stockholm.&nbsp;When it was
performed in Germany, the setting was changed from Tiananmen Square to
Germany during the Nazi era. Noteworthy, this play put Gao Xingjian
also at odds with the Chinese Overseas Democratic Movement. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When you use words, you're able to keep your mind alive. Writing is my way of reaffirming my own existence." </b>(Gao Xingjian in an interview) </font></blockquote>
<p>Gao Xingjian's reflective and impressionistic novel <i>Soul Mountain</i>,
completed in 1989, is based on 10-month walking tour along the Yangtze
River. The journey took five months and resulted from the author's
personal crisis: in 1982 he had been mistakenly diagnosed with lung
cancer&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;the ailment killed his father&nbsp;&#8211; and next year
the Communist Party criticised Gao's works as "spiritual pollution''.
Rumors spread that Gao was about to be sent to a labor camp. </p>
<p>In the work Gao Xingjian used different literary styles, techniques,
and a variety of narrators. "You know that I am just talking to myself
to alleviate my loneliness. You know that this loneliness of mine is
incurable, that no-one can save me and that I can only talk with myself
as the partner of my conversation." At one point, the narrator
criticizes the author, saying: "You've slapped together travel notes,
moralistic ramblings, feelings, notes, jottings, untheoretical
discussions, unfable-like fables, copied out some folk songs, added
some legend&nbsp;&#8211; like nonsense of your own, and are calling it
fiction!" <i>Soul Mountain</i> is a travelogue, description of rural
villages, a story of a love affair, pieces of folklore and history. One
of its central themes&nbsp;&#8211; as in Gao's work in general&nbsp;&#8211; is a
skeptical attitude to all generally accepted or authoritarian views:
"Oh history oh history oh history oh history / Actually history can be
read any way and this is a / major discovery!" </p>
<p>After concluding <i>Soul Mountain</i> Gao Xingjian wrote a short
essay in which he rejected literature's "duty to the masses" and stated
that "literature is not concerned with politics but is purely a matter
of the individual." Gao Xingjian wanted to free artistic expression
from its struggle for social approval, calling this kind of literature,
that has recovered its innate, spiritual character, "cold literature".
Before settling in France, he had read&nbsp;Nietzsche's major works,
and developed a profound&nbsp;aversion to the philosopher, who had
became highly popular in China. The plays<em> Taowang</em> (1989, Escape) and<em>&nbsp;Kouwen siwang</em>
(2004, &nbsp;The Man who Questios Death)&nbsp; reflected his critical
response to&nbsp;Nietzsche's notion of Superman and fashionable trends
in art and literature. </p>
<p>As an artist Gao Xingjian has illustrated his own book covers and he
has had some thirty international ink-wash painting exhibitions. He has
translated into Chinese such authors as Beckett, Ionesco, Artaud and
Brecht. Among his several awards are Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et
des Lettres by the French Government in 1992, Prix Communauté française
de Belgique 1994, and Prix du Nouvel An chinois 1997. Before the Nobel
Prize, Gao earned most of his living from his works as an artist, not
from his writings. In 1998 he acquired French citizenship. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"I'm not involved in politics, but
that does not prevent me from criticizing the policies of Communist
China. I say what I want to say. If I have chosen to live in exile, it
is to be able to express myself freely without constraints." </strong></font></blockquote>
<p>After the decision of the Nobel committee China's Foreign Ministry
called the award a political maneuver the nation took no pride in.
Members of the Communist Party-line literati questioned whether the
author and playwright was Nobel material. In Sweden Gao's way for the
prize was paved by Goran Malmqvist, who had translated
Gao's&nbsp;dramas and had them produced in Stockholm. Malmqvist is a
China expert at the University of Stockholm and also one the academy
members, who make the selection of Nobel laureates. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"From my experience in writing, I can say
that literature is inherently man's affirmation of the value of his own
self and that this is validated during the writing, literature is born
primarily of the writer's need for self-fulfilment. Whether it has any
impact on society comes after the completion of a work and that impact
certainly is not determined by the wishes of the writer."</b> (in the </font><i><font size="2">Nobel lecture</font></i><font size="2">, 2000) </font></blockquote>
<p>Gao's autobiographical <i>One's Man's Bible </i>appeared in English
in 2000. It is an account of China's Cultural Revolution, seen through
the eyes of the author as a political activist, victim, and outside
observer. "Tragedy, comedy and farce do not exist but are aesthetic
judgements of human life that differ according to person, time and
place." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">One Man's Bible</font></i><font size="2">, 2000) </font>In the work the numerous narrators from <i>Soul Mountain </i>have reduced to "you" (Gao's alter ego), "he" (an old acquaintance), and "she" (a Jewish woman). </p>
