<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Finnish working class poet, translator,
prominent member
of the literary group 'Kiila' (Wedge) with <a href="/sinervo.htm">Elvi
Sinervo</a>
and <a href="/vkajava.htm">Viljo Kajava</a>. Turtiainen drew his
subjects from the life of workers and his native city, Helsinki.
Central themes are the struggle of the proletariat, building of the
better future, and the threats of war and Fascism. Turtiainen's poems
show his familiarity with such American writers as <a href="/wwhitman.htm">Walt Whitman</a>, <a href="/sandburg.htm">Carl
Sandburg</a> and <a href="/emasters.htm">Edgar Lee Masters</a>.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"How many years &#8211; more than fifty,

        <font size="2">(from 'A Farewell to the Rööperi of My
Childhood') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Arvo Turtiainen was born in Helsinki, the son Ernst
Turtiainen, a
master tailor, and Ida Lovisa Väätäinen. Turtiainen's father was a
Socialist, and had a successful career, but alcoholism led him to
commit suicide in the early 1920s. During the Finnish Civil War
(1917-18), at the age of 13, Turtiainen witnessed the tragic fate of
the Reds at Suomenlinna's, the sea-fortress in front of Helsinki, which
served for a period as a notorious prison camp. </p>
      <p>After finishing school, Turtiainen graduated in 1925 as dental
technician. He worked then in the profession in Vyborg (1927-30) and in
Turku and Helsinki (1930-32, 34-36). Until the Depression years and
rise of the right-wing Lapua movement, which campaigned to root out all
vestiges of Marxism, Turtiainen was not much interested in workers
movement. Between the years 1931 and 1932, he studied at the Social
Institute journalism and social sciences, and began to contribute in
Jyväskylä to the leftist magazine <i>Työn Voima</i> (1932-34). From
this period, from 1932 onwards, Turtiainen's faithful companion was his
portable Remington typewriter, which he used over 40 years. </p>
      <p>In 1934 Turtiainen settled in Helsinki, and published poems in
the magazine <i>Tulenkantajat</i>
(The Fire Bearers). Soon he became one of the central members of the
literary group Kiila, serving as its chair until 1951. Kiila's members
favored radical free verse and were more or less Marxists. From 1936 to
1938, Turtiainen was a subeditor of <i>Kirjallisuuslehti</i>. From
1945 to 1947 he edited the magazine <i>40-luku.</i> </p>
      <p>Turtiainen published in 1936 his first collection of poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">Muutos</span>, in which he praised the
workers at factories and buildings, and cursed the evils of the
unemployment. It was followed by the novel<span style="font-style: italic;"> Rautakourat</span> (1939), a strike
story, for which Turtiainen worked for some time at a dockyard. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Tie pilven alta</span> (1939), and a
collection of verse, Turtiainen used the technique of epitaph similar
to that of <i>Spoon River Anthology.</i>
All major publishing houses had rejected the work. Eventually it was
accepted by Kirjailijain kustannusliike. Some of the poems were based
on true life accounts. 'Tehtailija Salovaara' told of a manufacturer,
who accidentally shot his gardener, believing him to be a crow. A
member of parliament for Isänmaallinen kansaliike, IKL (Patriotic
People's Party), a nationalist and anti-communist party, threatened
Turtiainen with an action of libel. <br>
      </p>
      <p>During the Winter War (1939-40), Turtiainen served for a short
time in the army as an officer in Virojoki. On leave, Turtiainen broke
his leg, and was hospitalized for six months due to embolus. At the
battle of Summa, where Turtiainen's company was sent when he was
convalescenting, about 60 % of its men died or were wounded. After the
Continuation War (1941-44), broke out, Turtiainen went into a hiding
place in Tammelund, refusing to participate alongside Nazi Germany in
the war against the Soviet Union. </p>
      <p>In winter 1942 Turtiainen's his hiding place was revealed to
the authorities and was arrested and imprisoned for two years. While in
prison, he managed to write a collection of poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">Palasin kotiin</span> (1944), which drew
it subject from the war. In 1945 appeared prison poems <span style="font-style: italic;">Laulu kiven ja raudan ympyrässä</span>.
Turtiainen's diary from the period, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ihminen
n:o 503/42</span>, which came out in 1946, describes the penalty system
lively and satirically. At Riihimäki Turtiainen was denied the right to
have books and pen and paper. The situation changed after he was sent
to Sukeva, where he met a doctor with whom he talked about poetry.
"Myrkky-Iivari" (Poison-Ivar), as the doctor is called in the diary,
considered Turtiainen an idealist. In the beginning of 1944, during the
bombings of Helsinki by the Soviet airforces, Turtiainen's home was
destroyed , but after the Red Army launched a massive attack at the
Isthmus of Karelia, Turtiainen wrote optimistically in his diary: "The
day of freedom is coming!" </p>
      <p>Turtiainen's translation of Edgar Lee Masters's <i>Spoon
River Anthology </i>came out in 1947. In 1948 he travelled to Italy
with the writer Henrik Tikkanen &#8211; Turtiainen had money only for one-way
ticket to Trieste. After drinking two weeks with Tikkanen, he went to
Hungary, where he joined a Finnish cultural delegation and returned via
Moscow to Helsinki. His first marriage ended in 1951 &#8211; Turtiainen had
married at the beginning of the Winter War Helena Vormula whom he had
known for years. Another blow was that his new collection of poems, <i>Runon
kalvas kalkki</i>, was rejected by the publishing company Otava. Eino
S. Repo, who sent the poems back, had served in the army as an officer
during the war. Later in the 1960s he was appointed director of the
Finnish Broadcasting Company. Repo considered it questionable whether
all texts in Turtiainen's collection could be classified as poem. This
period of crisis, which included a passionate affair with the woman who
would become his second wife, ended in the 1950s. </p>
      <p>Turtiainen married in 1953 the critic and translator Brita
Polttila (1920-2008); she made her debut as a poet at the age of 43
with the collection <i>Katson tästä</i> (1963). In 1954 Turtiainen
received his first state literature award for <span style="font-style: italic;">Laulu ajasta ja rakkaudesta</span>. A new
rise to popularity happened, when Turtiainen began to take his subjects
from his own life and utilize in his lyrics elements of city slang,
culminating in <span style="font-style: italic;">Minä paljasjalkainen</span>
(1962). </p>
      <p>In the 1950s and 1960s Turtiainen was both know for his
leftist political stand and his poems depicting with humour and satire
the streets, places, and people of Helsinki. He used the '
Stadi' slang, the everyday language of the turn-of-the-century
Helsinki, which borrowed words among others from Russia and Swedish.
From these poems Turtiainen gained the name 'Stadin Arska' (Big City
Archie). Several of his odes were inspired by his own neighborhood,
Punavuori ('Redhill'), called by its slang name of Rööperi.. "You've
disappeared, old Rööperi, disappeared / to live in the visions of my
memory, in the summer of my childhood / You disappeared like the old
maples and lime trees from your yards / you became a shambles, got
moss-grown, stopped flowering. . . ." <font size="2">(translated by
Herbert Lomas, from <i>Helsinki: A Literary Companion</i>, 2000) </font></p>
      <p>Turtiainen's vernacular coarseness, and critical attitude
toward society, was largely accepted as a part of his folksy, talkative
character. Turtiainen also wrote radio plays,
essays, and translated such writer as Vladimir Mayakovsky,
Graham Greene, Edgar Lee Masters, Walt Whitman, and Pasternak's poems
from <i>Doctor Zhivago</i> with Helvi Juvonen. In 1973 Turtiainen was
made honorary doctor at the University of Helsinki. </p>
      <p>Remaining faithful to the ideals of commitment, Turtiainen had
his
own special role in the decades, when modernism began to dominate the
literary scene, but he also showed understanding to the work of <a href="psaariko.htm">Pentti Saarikoski</a>, the most visible poet of
the younger, modernist generation. With Saarikoski, whom he once called
a "naughty, kicking, recalcitrant, grinning black sheep," he disputed
at the House of Culture in Helsinki in 1965. Saarikoski read poems from
his latest collection <i>Mitä tapahtuu todella?</i>. Turtiainen made
cracks about it and sang a folksy poem, with his beard trembling. The
literary show ended in a draw. </p>
      <p>Unlike Elvi Sinervo, who expressed her sorrow after Stalin's
death and had a personal crisis after Khrushchev condemned the '"cult
of personality," Turtiainen fought against Stalinism. Especially in
cultural policy it was seen in the ideological line of <a href="/aikia.htm">Armas Äikiä</a> (1904-64), a hard-line Communist,
who returned in 1947 from the Soviet Union to Finland. For some time
Turtiainen's position as the major poet of the Communist Party was
threatened by Äikiä, whose works never gained a critical acclaim. When
the Nobel Laureate Boris Pasternak was expelled from the Union of
Soviet Writers in 1958, Turtiainen sent with the writer Elvi Sinervo a
protest letter to the Union. In 1964 Turtiainen visited China, where he
was disappointed at the level of literature. He also noted that Chinese
writers can quote classic drinking songs, but they don't drink.
However, like Pentti Haanpää, who had travelled in China in 1953,
Turtiainen did not condemn there restrictions on free speech. </p>
      <p>After the Soviet intervention in the Hungarian revolution of
1956, Turtiainen gradually left the Communist Party, eventually
resigning in 1965. The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (August 20-21,
1968) divided the Left parties. Officially the invasion was condemned
by the Communist Party, although its minority wing strongly opposed the
decision. Turtiainen's disappointment in the crushing of the "Prague
Spring" came out in <span style="font-style: italic;">Puhetta
Porthaninrinteellä&nbsp; </span>(1968). Turtiainen compared the Soviet
Union to an elephant in 'Pettyneelle rakastetulle' but also praised the
courage and faith of Communists in 'Kommunisteille', dated 21 August,
1968. However, most of the poems in the collection dealt with aging,
love, Helsinki, and the work of a poet. 'Rukous Hannu Salaman puolesta'
defended the novelist Hannu Salama, who had been found guilty of
"deliberate blasphemy" in 1966. Later the judgement was overturned. </p>
