<p>Italian artist, cartoonist, whose best-known character is the
existentialist adventurer, captain Corto Maltese. His journeys around
the world are followed from his youth to the 1930s, when Corto
disappears in the turmoils of the Spanish Civil War. Pratt's own
travels mark his work, in which his hero's alienation from a dull,
ordinary world is underlined by the strange, remote surroundings, or as
the famous American cartoonist Frank Miller wrote: "His drawings show
an attention to, and familiarity with, exotic detail, far beyond what
could be gleaned from a shelf full of <i>National Geographic </i>magazines.
There is nothing stolen, or even borrowed, in Pratt's work; even his
sense of humor seems to come from preposterous experience."<font size="2"> (from <i>Voodoo for the President</i>, 1986) </font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>(Morgan Le Fay:) ... there is
someone... a sailor sleeping, or perchance dreaming. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">(Merlin:) Yes, but he's dreaming with his eyes
open, and
those that dream with their eyes open are dangerous, for they do not
know when their dreams come to an end.</font></b><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Celts</font></i><font size="2">, 1971-72) </font></blockquote>
<p>Hugo Pratt was born near Rimini, the son of Rolando Pratt, a
fanatic supporter of Mussolini and professional soldier, and Evelina
Genero, from Venice; she was the widely traveled daughter of a pedicure
and poet. Rolando Pratt was of English descent. In his childhood and
youth Hugo went with his parents first to Venice, and then to Ethiopia
&#8211; both locations of his later works. The family settled in Entoto and
Pratt entered the high school Vittorio Emanuele III. Rolando, who had
enlisted in the Italian African Police, died in a POW camp in 1942,
after British forces had completed the conquest of the Italian East
Africa. According to some sources he died of liver cancer. During the
war, Pratt wroked some time as an interpreter for a fascist battalion.
Before returning with his mother to Venice in the early 1940s, he was
shipped to Austria after he had surrendered to the Allies. There are
many stories about Pratt's early years, some of them true and some of
them untrue, or as he once said: "I've 13 ways of telling my life
story, and I don't know if even one of them is the true one, or more
true than the others." </p>
<p>In 1945 Pratt entered the Venice Academy of Fine Arts. He
created with Mario Faustinelle and Alberto Ungaro <i>Asso di Picche</i>,
a hooded man of justice in the tradition of <i>fumetti</i>, Italian
comics. With his friends he opened doors to the appreciation of
American style comics, based on the works of Joseph Conrad, Jack
London, Herman Melville, and Robert Louis Stevenson, which were not
seen during Mussolini's reign. In 1950 Pratt moved to Argentina, where
he worked for the publisher Cesare Civita, Editorial Abril in Buenos
Aires and for Hector G. Oesterheld, editor of Editorial Frontera.
During this period Pratt also taught at the Escuela Panamericana de
Arte. In 1953 he married the Yugoslavian born Gucky Wogerer; they
divorced in 1957, and Pratt married Anne Frognier, whom he used as the
model for Ann of the Jungle. She was also known as the colorist of
Pratt's work in the 1970s.</p>
<p>With Oesterheld he collaborated first on <span style="font-style: italic;">Sgt. Kirk</span> for <span style="font-style: italic;">Misterix</span>
magazine. Kirk is a U.S. soldier, who &#8211; after taking part in a massacre
during the Indian wars &#8211; has decided to fight on the other side, or as
he says: "There are no palefaces or Indians . . . there are just men .
. . just men." Other characters include Kirk's blood brother Maha, who
belongs to the Chattooga people, Corto Lea, a former outlaw, and Dr.
Forbes. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sgt. Kirk</span> was also
drawn by Jorge Moliterni, Horacio Porreca, Gisela Dester, and Gustavo
Trigo. <br>
</p>
<p>For the magazine <i>Supertotem </i>Pratt wrote and drew <i>Ann
y Dann</i>, which was published in 1959 and appeared in Italy between
1963 and 1966 under the title <i>Anna nella jungla</i>.
Until then Pratt had drawn for stories written by others. He set the
story in Africa in 1914, but avoiding politics he created a
half-imaginary country familiar from the stories of Henry Rider Haggard
and Lyman Young's <i>Tim Tyler</i>. The heroine, Anna, got her name
from Anne Frognier, Pratt's neighbor. Anna's companion is Dan, the son
of Bogardia's king. In this world of white English colonizers,
rebellious black tribes, European adventurers and swindlers Pratt
showed his skill in creating memorable minor characters, especially
Tipperary O'Hara, a sailor, who could be considered an Irish version of
Corto Maltese. </p>
<p>In South America Pratt created some of his most important
strips, including <i>Sgt. Kirk</i> (1953), <i>Ernie Pike</i> (1956),
and <i>Anna della Jungla</i>. From Argentina Pratt moved to London,
England, working for the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, the <i>Sunday Pictorial
</i>and for Fleetways Publications. After a short stay in
Argentina, where he edited the magazine <i>Mister X</i>, Pratt settled
back in Italy, working for the Corriere dei Piccolo in Milan, then in
1967 for the monthly <i>Sgt. Kirk</i>, created with Florenzo Ivaldi.
Pratt also contributed <i>Capitan Cormorand</i>, a pirate story, <i>Luck
Star O'Hara</i>, a detective strip, and <i>Una Ballata del Mare Salato</i>
(A Ballad of the Salty Sea), where Corto Maltese made his first
appearance as a subsidiary character. When Pratt disappeared for a
period in the Amazon jungle in 1964, rumors began to spread that he had
died. Throughout the following two decades, Pratt was always on the
road in between his projects. </p>
<p>Pratt's best collections include <i>Corto Maltese In Siberia</i>,
published first in an Italian magazine in 1974-1975, <i>A Midsummer
Morning's Dream</i>, and <i>Fable of Venice</i>. In <i>Tango</i>
Pratt used his knowledge of Argentinian history and culture. <i>Corto
Maltese: Voodoo for the President</i>, a sequel to <i>Banana Conga</i>,
which was translated into English in 1986, followed Corto's adventures
in South America and in Venice. Frank Miller, who wrote the
introduction to <i>Voodoo for the President, </i>nods to Pratt in <i>The
Black Widow: The Coldest War</i> (written by Gerry Conway, 1990) &#8211; an
island over which the Americans and the Soviets battle is called "Corto
Maltese". </p>
<p>When <i>Sgt. Kirk</i>'s Western adventures lost their appeal,
Pratt introduced Corto Maltese into the French comic weekly <i>Pif</i>
on April 1, 1970, and developed the character further. In 1973 he began
to work for the Belgian <i>Tintin</i>, and created <i>Les Scorpions
du Désert</i>, a World War II story. Corto's adventures appeared also
in the Belgian magazine <i>A Suivre</i>. </p>
<p> In addition to <i>Corto Maltese</i>, Pratt created a number
of independent comic strip series. Most notable was <i>Cato Zulu</i>
(1984), a tale of the colonial wars in South Africa; <i>West of Eden</i>,
an adventure set in the wilds of East Africa; and <i>Jesuit Joe</i>
(1978-1984). He wrote scripts for two graphic novels illustrated by
Milo Manara, and published several prose novels as well as a book of
memoirs. <i>El Gaucho</i> (1991), set in Argentina in 1806, was packed
with half-dressed women and sex, but the story had all the elements of
a typical Corto Maltese story: carefully studied historical background,
a rootless young man in a strange country, a secret society, this time
a Masonic group, and characters who are not totally good or bad. </p>
<p>Pratt's famous aphoristic hero, Corto Maltese, is a sea
captain, a
classical romantic hero but not a sentimental Byronic wretch. He could
be the father of Tintin or his more mature version. Corto's world
is a distinct world of his own: "I don't like hawking 'round other
people's memories... That wasn't part of the deal... when I was born." <font size="2">(Corto Maltese in </font><i><font size="2">The Celts</font></i><font size="2">) </font>Corto's
father is an English sailor from Cornwall, his mother a gypsy from
Gibraltar. As a rebel, he mostly sides with the oppressed, with
Indians, Irish revolutionaries against the British, Russians fighting
against the Czarist system. Pratt often combines fact with fiction, and
sets the actions of his characters against some true historical crisis.
In <i>The Celt</i>'s, published first in Pif in 1971-1972, Corto meets
Merlin the Wizard and characters from Shakespeare's play <i>Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>, and sinks with a tugboat, named 'Excalibur,' a
German submarine. </p>
<p>In Pratt's strips fictional characters intermingle with real
historical persons, among them the indestructible Grigoriy Rasputin (d.
1916), a notorious lecher and drunkard, who gained the confidence of
the emperor Nicholas II, and who is seen in several albums. The French
poet Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891) was portrayed in <i>Les Ethiopiques</i>
(1972-1973). In 1973 Pratt visited Harar where Rimbaud had lived and
where his father was buried. Rasputin is Corto's dark Doppelganger and
proclaims in <i>Corto Maltese in Siberia</i> (74-75): "It's hopeless
to live in a world without adventure, without fantasy, without joy!" In
<span style="font-style: italic;">La casa dorata di Samarcanda</span>
(1980), Corto meets his look-alike, Timur Chevket, <em></em>a Turkish
officer, who is shot by
Rasputin. The figure of the Siberian monk has also inspired the French
cartoonist
Benoit Sokal in his series about the pet Detective Canardo. Pascal
Morelli's animation films, based on Pratt's stories, started in 2002
from <i>Maltese in Siberia</i>, entitled <i>Corto Maltese, la cour
secrète des arcanes</i>. Originally Morelli planned to begin the series
in 1999 with the<i> Ballad of the Salt Sea</i>.</p>
<p>'A Tale of Two Grandfathers' from <i>Voodoo for the President
</i>(1986)
is in many respects a typical Corto Maltese adventure, in which the the
secondary characters are treated without stereotyping and the story is
rich with detail. It combines jungle magic with a battle between good
and evil and a nearly metaphysical quest for Eldorado &#8211; the place is
mentioned casually. Behind the story lurks<a href="jconrad.htm"> Joseph
Conrad</a>'s <i>Heart of Darkness</i>.
Corto is travelling in Peru on a riverboat. He has a fight with another
passenger, Mendoza, who tried to cheat him with loaded dice. His
friends, Levi Columbia and Professor Steiner, think that the reason for
the fight was nobler &#8211; Mendoza is a slave hunter. Levi Columbia says:
"I had you come here because, as usual, I need a man I can trust and
who's courageous enough to penetrate nobody's jungle... You are the
perfect choice... Corto..." After first refusing to take the work,
Corto goes in the jungle to look for a young boy, Doctor Stone's
grandson. He is bitten by a poisonous snake and nearly dies. "An
Indian, a sorcerer, whom he calls "Ditch-Jumper", helps him. "Corto...
Corto Maltese... But since Indians all have secret names... you can
call me The-One-Who-Never-Gets-To-Do-It-For-Himself. There, you can
call me that... Good luck, Ditch-Jumper..." The feverish Corto follows
the Indian who throws Mendoza from his boat to piranhas. Corto finds
the boy, he is also Ditch-Jumper's grandson, and takes him to Doctor
Stone. Levi Columba reveals that he was actually interested in old
manuscripts about hidden cities. "Eldorado... Maybe a tale painted on
human skin, the skin of a Franciscan monk, hide taken by Jivaro
Indians, and which one can find hidden on an island in Venice... St.
Francis of the desert. I don't know, Levi... It's a beautiful tale, and
today is a beautiful day without any bugs...." </p>
<p>Stylistically Pratt's art was similar to that of Chester Gould
(<i>Dick Tracy</i>) and Milton Caniff (<i>Steve Canyon</i>),
"the Rembrandt of the comic strip," who became famous for his mastery
of drawing, skillful use of characterization and dialogue. Later Pratt
found his own minimalist style, with dramatic use of black and white
surfaces, figures posing stiffly and moving jerkily, exchanging
enigmatic dialogue. The backgrounds are simple. Noteworthy, originally
Corto's adventures were set in the era of black and white movies, but
later Pratt produced also colored versions. </p>
<p>From the mid-1980s Pratt lived in Grandvaux, Switzerland. A
passionate bibliophile, he built up a collection of some 30,000 books
in his house.
With Patrizia Zanotti, who was his close collaborator and colorist from
the 1980s, Pratt traveled three years before his death in the South
Pacific. Pratt died of cancer at his home near Lausanne, Switzerland,
on August 20, 1995. His last large work, <i>Morgan</i>,
appeared first serialized and in a book form in 1999. The protagonist
is a young British navy officer, Morgan, whose name refers to the
famous pirate. The episodic story of his World War II adventures is set
mostly on the Adriatic Sea. Morgan is enlisted by the secret service
and he kills a beautiful woman &#8211; something that Corto Maltese wouldn't
do by anybody's orders. </p>
