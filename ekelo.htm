<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> Swedish poet and essayist, one of the greatest poets of the 20th century in the Nordic countries. 
Ekelöf started as a modernist under the influence of French surrealism, but mostly he did not follow fashionable 
literary currents. An alchemist of words, Ekelöf followed his visions, and 
searched for inner, often mystical truths &#8211; "ändå tvingas jag söka / detta förlorade något, 
/ osynligt, outsägligt, / detta som alltid / går mina känslor förbi." 
<font size="2">(from 'Ökenstämningar')</font> His last years Ekelöf spent with his most 
ambitious work, the "Byzantine trilogy" &#8211; a product of his long-time interest in the history 
and cultures of the Near East. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Yes, I long for home, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Homeless I long for home, </font><br>
<font size="2">Home to where love is, the one, the good, </font><br>
<font size="2">Home to my real home! </font><br>
<font size="2">That home is bright - </font><br>
<font size="2">In my mind I open the door, </font><br>
<font size="2">See everything awaiting me there. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'One after one') </font></blockquote>
<p>Gunnar Ekelöf was born in Stockholm into a wealthy family. His
father, Gerhard Ekelöf, was a stockbroker. He had contracted syphilis
in the 1890s, and in 1916 he died of general paralysis of the insane.
At that time Ekelöf's mother Valfrid (von Hedenberg) had already
separated from her husband; she married again in 1921. Ekelöf had
worshiped his father, who had pampered him, and he did not accept his
stepfather, Gunnar Hahr, and his new brother, Lennart, who, moreover
began to sympathize with the nazis. Once writing of his mother he
called her "en ond fé" (an evil witch); his frustrated love towards
her, his disillusionment, and mystic ideas of a Virgin beyond good and
evil, became recurrent themes in Ekelöf's texts. In 1920 Ekelöf
traveled with his mother in France and Italy, and in 1921 in Germany.
During the next decades he often visited Paris, and traveled in the
1950s and 1960s in the Mediterranean countries, Italy, Greece, Turkey,
and Tunisia. </p>
<p>After graduating from a gymnasium in 1926 Ekelöf went to London,
where he studied oriental languages at the School of Oriental Studies
for a few months. He returned soon to Sweden where he entered the
University of Uppsala. There he studied Persian, but did not graduate.
In 1928 he received a share of his father's inheritance, becoming
economically independent. In the late 1920s, Ekelöf lived in Paris. He
studied music and came into contact with cubism and surrealism. In 1930
he met Gunnel Bergström; they married two years later in the summer.
She left him for Karin Boye in the same autumn. Boye was a member of
the Clarté circle like Ekelöf, and was married to her Clarté friend
Leif Björck in a kind of friendship union. </p>
<p>Ekelöf's first book, <i>sent på jorden</i> (1932), was received with hostile reviews &#8211; the Swedish public was 
not ready for this kind of modernism, that had abandoned even capital letters. He had written the poems in 
Paris plagued by suicidal thoughts and listening to 
Stravinsky's <i>Sacre du Printemps</i>. In this nihilistic work Ekelöf asked for "poison to die or dreams to 
live". His following books were produced during a period which was marked by disappointments in love and hard drinking. 
Aware of the threat of Nazism, he visited in 1933 Germany and was convinced that "Hell is drawing 
near to Earth" and "the time of hate has come". <i>Dedikation</i> (1934) was his book of visions and dreams. 
Ekelöf supplied it with an epigraph from Rimbaud: "I say: one must be a seer, one must make oneself a seer." 
One of its poems, 'Fossil inskrift,' was about the Swedish artist Carl Frederik Hill (1849-1911), who suffered from 
schizophrenia. Ekelöf again returned to the artist in<i> C.F. Hill </i>(1946). </p>
<p>Ekelöf had lost most his inheritance when the Swedish financier Ivar Kreuger committed suicide in Paris in 1932 and 
his group of companies went into bankruptcy. Much of the money he still had he invested in the short-lived publishing 
company Spektrum. Its journal, bearing the same name and modelled after T.S. Eliot's <i>Criterion</i>, was edited by 
Karin Boye, Erik Mestertin and Josef Riwkin. Spectrum followed international literary currents and published works 
Harry Martinson, Arthur Lundkvist, and Eyvind Johnson. Also Ekelöf's early translations from al-'Arabí, 
Rimbaud, and Desnos appeared on its pages. </p>
<p>Ekelöf met in 1935 Maj Strindberg &#8211;  their correspondence was published in 1989. He worked for a short time 
as a literary critic for <i>Social-Demokraten</i>; he had also started to write art reviews and established with Arthur 
Lundkvist and Knut Jaensson the avant-garde magazine<i> Karavan</i>. Ekelöf was too much of an individualist and 
outsider to join any political party, but labor union magazines printed his poems. They were, according to the 
working-class writer Ivar Lo-Johansson, incomprehensible for most of the readers. He had become friends with Ekelöf 
in the 1930s. "He had learned everything from books," Lo-Johanson wrote in <i>Frihet</i> (1985) of his friend, 
whom he considered a snob. "He mocked the masses, mocked trade unions, mocked all beliefs in progress and the vision 
of the poor and gullible workers that they could create a better world." In the 1930s Ekelöf had participated 
at least once in the traditional workers march on May Day, but his rebelliousness did not lead to political activism. 
</p>
<p>In an essay of 1935 Ekelöf distanced himself from Rimbaud, who had inspired his earlier work. Now he turned 
to <a href="sodergra.htm">Edith Södergran</a>'s poetry. Ekelöf never knew her &#8211; she had died in 1923. 
However, he met Södergran's mother Helen, and later said that she spoke old fashioned Swedish. Even 
Edith Södergran had troubles with modern Swedish grammar. In 1938 Ekelöf with <a href="elmerdik.htm">Elmer 
Diktonius</a> visited her summer house in Finland, at Raivola on the Karelian Isthmus, where she had lived 
permanently from the eve of World War I. Ekelöf's poem from <i>Opus incertum</i> (1959), 'Jag skriver 
till dig' (Jag skriver till dig från ett avlägset land / Det har inger färg) has perhaps some 
connections with Södergran's poem 'The Country That Is Not' (I long for the country that is not, / For 
everything that is I am tired of desiring), but it also refers to Henri Michaux's long prose poem 'Je vous écris 
d'un pays lointain'. </p>
<p><i>Färjesång</i> (1941) showed the influence of T.S. Eliot whose <i>East Coker </i>Ekelöf translated 
into Swedish. However, the two poets did not meet until 1948, when T.S. Eliot received the Nobel Prize for literature. 
Ekelöf has sometimes been called  as Sweden's T.S. Eliot, but the famous American-English leader of the 
modernist movement in literature was one of 
those poets whom he at first found important, and then rejected.

The illusionless <i>Färjesång</i> had connections with oriental poetry, Dhammapada and Lao-tse, but the opening song, 
referring to Charon's boat, had much to do with the massacres and atrocities of World War II.  
Sweden managed to remain neutral, but the neighboring counties, Finland, Norway and Denmark, were drawn into war. 
In this situation 
some authors, among them Eyvind Johnson, criticized the controversial policy of neutrality. Ekelöf's prose 
works, <i>Promenader</i> (1941) and <i>Ulflykter</i> (1947), reveal how much the 
slaughter on the European battlefields
had depressed him, an outsider and individualist, who rebelled against all ideologies. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am a stranger in this land </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">but this land is not stranger in me!" </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Non Serviam</font></i><font size="2">, 1945) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1943 Ekelöf married Gunhild (Nun) Flodquist; their stormy marriage lasted nearly ten years. 
After the war Ekelöf published 
<i>Non Serviam</i> (1945), a disillusioned examination of human aspirations. "In reality you are nothing," 
Ekelöf wrote, adding a hopeful note: "Det finns en skönhetsfläck i allt, / det enda verkliga 
jag sett: Jag håller mig till den." Ekelöf accepts that the world is not perfect. As a rebel he 
identified himself with Lucifer, like Milton. The Latin title of the book, in the words of the fallen angel, 
means "I will not serve". <i>Om hösten</i> (1951) contains one of Ekelöf's most famous poems, 
'Röster under jorden' (Voices from underground). </p>
<p> Ekelöf's marriage eventually collapsed in 1951, when 
he started to live with his wife's sister Ingrid Flodquist,  a published poet, whose collection 
<i>Gobeläng</i> had appeared in 1949. They married in 1952 and traveled in Holland, 
France and Italy. Their daughter Suzanne Charlotte was born in the same year. In the mid-1950s the family 
moved to Sigtuna. </p>
<p>In <i>Strountes</i> (1955), a Frenchification of the Swedish expression "sturnt" (nonsense), 
Ekelöf continued his attack on literary conventions which he started in his first book. He examined 
meaning and meaninglessness, and showed with his puns how nonsense has much sense, and how irrational and 
poor our language can be. As in his other collections, Ekelöf used paradoxes and contrast, but did 
not give any simple solutions or Hegelian synthesis. "What I wrote / I wrote between the lines," 
he states. </p>
<p><i>En Mölna-elegi</i><i> </i>(1960, A Mölna Elegy) was a highly personal collection of free-flowing 
associations, moods, and memories, supported by voices of such writers as Emanuel Swedenborg, August Strindberg, 
Edith Södergran, and Carl Michael Bellman. Ekelöf began to compose the elegy in the late 1930s but it 
was finally published in 1960. <i>A Mölna Elegy</i> has been called Ekelöf's most Joycean work &#8211;  
one of the voices actually is Joyce's Stephen Dedalus from <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> (1916).  
The poems, dealing with the Proustian theme of memory, were set on one day during the Indian summer of 1940. 
The poet sits at Mölna dock in Lidingö, his thoughts leading to a vision of great fire. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>A desolate wind from the city</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">and nearer, further </font><br>
<font size="2">the bell's burden, swinging fifths</font><br>
<font size="2">- it's burning! it's burning! - </font><br>
<font size="2">of the dread march: </font><br>
<font size="2">We lived - just then! </font><br>
<font size="2">We live now not at all, </font><br>
<font size="2">we shall live - for the firs time!</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Marche funèbre' in <i>A Mölna Elegy</i>, 1960) </font></blockquote>
<p>Ekelöf became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1958 and received an honorary doctorate from the 
University of Uppsala. After is mother died in 1961, Ekelöf published <span style="font-style: italic;">En natt i Oto&#269;ac</span>, an 
excursion in the archaic Mediterranean world which ended with the lines: "On earth they become shadows 
/ out of which dusk builds / that realm of Hades / where the dark violets grow." In 1966 he received the 
Nordic Literature Prize. </p>
<p><i>Diwán över Fursten av Emgión </i>(1965) was the first part of Ekelöf's 
ecstatic Byzantine poem, which he continued in <i>Sagan om Fatumeh</i> (1966) and <i>Vägvisare till 
underjorden</i> (1967). Although it appeared during the cold war and the global juxtaposition of East and 
West, its historical vision was not political but universal. Already in the 1920s, Ekelöf had&nbsp; been 
fascinated by <i>Tarjúman al-Ashwáq</i>, a collection of mystical odes written by Muhammad Ibn 'Arabi, who lived in the 12th-century. In <span style="font-style: italic;">A Mölna Elegy</span> the Sufi poet says "Labbayka!" (At thy service!).  <br>
</p>
      <p>Inspired by the sight of a Byzantine icon of the Madonna, 
worn down by kisses, Ekelöf wrote 17 poems for <i>Diwán</i> 
during a single night in a hotel room in Istanbul. Its motto was taken from <i>Tarjúman al-Ashwáq</i>. 
In the first part he introduced one of his central images, the Madonna figure. In <i>Non serviam</i> he had written 
about the winged Virgin in the great ode 'Samothrake'; the image of the cosmic Virgin-Mother had appeared in 
different forms in several poems from <i>Färjesång</i>. In 1950 in a letter to his friend 
<a href="rencell.htm">Rabbe Enckell</a> he had presented his concept of divinity which he connected 
to feminine being. The narrator in <i>Diwán</i> is a Byzantine prince, Emgión, who is captured by 
his enemies, and is tortured 
and blinded. His guide is a young prostitute, Fatumeh, loved by the Prince, but her name also refers to fate and death. "I 
don't live / if you are dead," Ekelöf writes. In their story he examined his favorite dichotomies, 
blindness and visions, eroticism and mysticism, etc. against the background of the Manichean dualistic world 
of light and darkness. With the trilogy Ekelöf confessed his basically pagan faith in the love of the 
Magna Mater.</p>
      <p><a href="whauden.htm">W.H. Auden</a>, who translated Ekelöf's poems into English with Leif Sjöberg, translated also Pär Lagerkvist's poems from <span style="font-style: italic;">Aftonland</span>.
When he visited Ekelöf's house he found it "rather extravagant" for a
poet. And the furniture were "expensive looking" antiques. Ekelöf
himself seemed to be depressed, perhaps "due to a drinking problem."
The conversation was diplomatic but cordial. They both also shared the
same tendency towards mysticism. At the time, when Auden took a serious
interest in Ekelöf's work, the poet was already fatally ill. His wife
Ingrid read and
commented the translations as they progressed. <font size="-1">('Translating with W.H. Auden: Gunnar Ekelöf's last poems' by Leif Sjöberg, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Comparative Criticism: A Yearbook. Volume 1</span>, edited by E.S. Shaffer, 1979, pp. 186-190)&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p>Ekelöf died on March 16, 1968 in Sigtuna. His ashes were scattered in the river Sardis, near the cult of 
Artemis. The Gunnar Ekelöf Association was founded in 1989. Ekelöf's writings continued to appear in 
posthumous publications. The poet's work, full of references to philosophy, literature, history, and myths, has 
interested a number of scholars. Their studies have clarified Ekelöf's ideas for a wider public although in 
general he is still considered a "difficult" poet. Before his death Ekelöf planned to write his 
autobiography after the model of Stendhal's <i>Vie de Henry Brular</i>, but the plan was never realized. </p>
