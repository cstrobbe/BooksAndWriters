<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American-born writer, gifted with
talents in literature, psychology, and philosophy. James wrote 20
novels, 112 stories, 12 plays and a number of literary criticism. His
models were Dickens, Balzac, and Hawthorne. James once said that he
learned more of the craft of writing from Balzac "than from anyone
else". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A novel is in its broadest sense a
personal, a direct impression of life: that, to begin with, constitutes
its value, which is greater or less according to the intensity of the
impression." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Art of Fiction</font></i><font size="2">, 1885) </font></blockquote>

<p>Henry James was born in New York City into a wealthy family. His
father, Henry James Sr., was one of the best-known intellectuals in
mid-nineteenth-century America, whose friends included Thoreau, Emerson
and Hawthorne. James made little money from his novels. Once his
friend, the writer <a href="wharton.htm">Edith Wharton</a>, secretly arranged him a royal advance of $8,000 for&nbsp;<em>The Ivory Tower</em>&nbsp;(1917),
but the money actually came from Wharton's royalty account with the
publisher. When Wharton sent him a letter bemoaning her unhappy
marriage, James replied: "Keep making the movements of life." </p>
<p>In his youth James traveled back and forth between Europe and
America. He studied with tutors in Geneva, London, Paris, Bologna and
Bonn At the age of nineteen he briefly attended Harvard Law School, but
was more interested in literature than studying law. James published
his first short story, 'A Tragedy of Errors' two years later, and then
devoted himself to literature. In 1866-69 and 1871-72 he was
contributor to the <i>Nation</i> and <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.</p>
<p>From an early age James had read the classics of English, American,
French and German literature, and Russian classics in translation. His
first novel, <em>Watch and Ward</em> (1871), appeared first serially in the <em>Atlantic</em>. James wrote it while he was traveling through Venice and Paris. <i>Watch and Ward</i> tells a story of a bachelor who adopts a twelve-year-old girl and plans to marry her.</p>

<p>After living in Paris, where James was contributor to the New York <i>Tribune,</i>
he moved to England, living first in London and then in Rye, Sussex.
"It is a real stroke of luck for a particular country that the capital
of the human race happens to be British. Surely every other people
would have it theirs if they could. Whether the English deserve to hold
it any longer might be an interesting field of inquiry; but as they
have not yet let it slip the writer of these lines professes without
scruple that the arrangement is to his personal taste. For after all if
the sense of life is greatest there, it is a sense of the life of
people of our incomparable English speech."<b></b><font size="2"><b> </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">London</font></i><font size="2">, 1888) </font>During
his first years in Europe James wrote novels that portrayed Americans
living abroad. James's years in England were uneventful. In 1905 he
visited America for the first time in twenty-five year, and wrote
'Jolly Corner.' It was based on his observations of New York, but also
a nightmare of a man, who is haunted by a <i>doppelgänger</i>. </p>
<p>Between 1906 and 1910 James revised many of his tales and novels for
the so-called New York Edition of his complete works. It was published
by Charles Scribner's Sons. His autobiography, <em>A Small Boy and Others </em>(1913) was continued in <em>Notes of a Son and Brother </em>(1914). The third volume <em>The Middle Years</em>,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;posthumously in 1917. The outbreak of World War I was a shock
for James and in 1915 he became a British citizen as a loyalty to his
adopted country and in protest against the US's refusal to enter the
war. </p>
<p>James suffered a stroke on December 2, 1915. He expected to die and
exclaimed: "So this is it at last, the distinguished thing!" However,
James died three months later in Rye on February 28, 1916. Two novels,<i> The Ivory Tower </i>and <em>The Sense of the Past </em>(1917), were left unfinished at his death. </p>

<p>Characteristic for James novels are understanding and sensitively
drawn lady portraits; James himself was a homosexual, but sensitive to
basic sexual differences and the fact that he was a male. His main
themes were the innocence of the New World in
conflict with corruption and wisdom of the Old. Among his masterpieces
is <em>Daisy Miller </em>(1879), where the young and innocent American Daisy finds her values in conflict with European sophistication. <br>
</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;<em>The Portrait of a&nbsp;Lady</em>&nbsp;(1881) again
a young American woman is fooled during her travels in Europe. James
started to write the work in Florence in 1879 and continued with it in
Venice. The definitive version appeared in 1908. "I had rooms on Riva
Sciavoni, at the top of a house near the passage leading off to San
Zaccaria; the waterside life, the wondrous lagoon spread before me, and
the ceaseless human chatter of Venice came in at my windows, to which I
seem to myself to have been constantly driven, in the fruitless fidget
of composition, as if to see whether, out in the blue channel, the ship
of some right suggestion, of some better phrase, of the next happy
twist of my subject, the next true touch for my canvas, mightn't come
into sight." When James set out to explore the origins of the novel in
1906, he defined it as "a square and spacious house." A house of
fiction has "not one window, but a million," from which one may peer
out at the "spreading field, the human scene." <br>
 </p>

<p>The protagonist is Isabel Archer, a penniless orphan. She goes to
England to stay with her aunt and uncle, and their tubercular son,
Ralph. Isabel inherits money and goes to Continent with Mrs Touchett
and Madame Merle. She turns down proposals of marriage from Casper
Goodwood, and marries Gilbert Osmond, a middle-aged snobbish widower
with a young daughter, Pansy. "He had a light, lean, rather
languid-looking figure, and was apparently neither tall nor short. He
was dressed as a man who takes little other trouble about it than to
have no vulgar thing." Isabel discovers that Pansy is Madame Merle's
daughter, it was Madame Merle's plot to marry Isabel to Osmond so that
he, and Pansy can enjoy Isabel's wealth. Caspar Goodwood makes a last
attempt to gain her, but she returns to Osmond and Pansy. </p>
<p><em>The&nbsp;Bostonians</em>&nbsp;(1886), set in the era of the rising feminist movement, was based on <a href="daudet.htm">Alphonse Daudet</a>'s novel <i>L'Évangéliste</i>. <em>What Maisie Knew </em>(1897) depicted a preadolescent young girl, who must chose between her parents and a motherly old governess. In&nbsp;<em>The Wings of the Dove</em>&nbsp;(1902) a heritage destroys the love of a young couple. James considered <em>The Ambassadors </em>(1903)
his most "perfect" work of art. The novel depicts Lambert Strether's
attempts to persuade Mrs Newsome' son Chad to return from Paris back to
the United States. Strether's possibility to marry Mrs Newsome is
dropped and he remains content in his role as a widower and observer.
"The beauty that suffuses <i>The Ambassadors</i> is the reward due to
a fine artist for hard work. James knew exactly what he wanted, he
pursued the narrow path of aesthetic duty, and success to the full
extent of his possibilities has crowned him. The pattern has woven
itself, with modulation and reservations Anatole France will never
attain. But at what sacrifice!"<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Aspects of the Novel</font></i><font size="2"> by E.M. Forster, 1927) </font></p>

<p>Although James is best-known for his novels, his essays are now
attracting audience outside scholarly connoisseurs. In his early
critics James considered British and American novels dull and formless
and French fiction "intolerably unclean." "M. Zola is magnificent, but
he strikes an English reader as ignorant; he has an air of working in
the dark; if he had as much light as energy, his results would be of
the highest value." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Art of Fiction</font></i><font size="2">) </font>In <em>Partial Portraits </em>(1888)
James paid tribute to his elders, and Emerson, George Eliot, and
Turgenev. His advice to aspiring writers avoided all theorizing:<font size="1"> </font>"Oh, do something from your point of view." H.G. Wells used James as the model for George Boon in his <i>Boon</i>
(1915). When the protagonist argued that novels should be used for
propaganda, not art, James wrote to Wells: "It is art that makes life,
makes interest, makes importance, and I know of no substitute whatever
for the force and beauty of its process. If I were Boon I should say
that any pretense of such a substitute is helpless and hopeless humbug;
but I wouldn't be Boon for the world, and am only yours faithfully,
Henry James." </p>
<p>James's most famous tales 
include 'The Turn of the Screw,' written mostly in the form of a journal, was first published serially in <i>Collier's Weekly</i>, and then with another story in<em> The Two Magics </em>(1898).
The protagonist is a governess, who works on a lonely estate in
England. She tries to save her two young charges, Flora and Miles, two
both innocent and corrupted children, from the demonic influence of the
apparitions of two former servants in the household, steward Peter
Quint and the previous governess Miss Jessel. Her employer, the
children's uncle, has given strict orders not to bother him with any of
the details of their education. Although the children evade the
questions about the ghosts but she certain is that the children see
them. When she tries to exorcize their influence, Miles dies in her
arms. The story inspired later a debate over the question of the
"reality" of the ghosts, were her visions only hallucinations. In the
beginning of his career James had rejected "spirit-rappings and
ghost-raising," but in the 1880s he become interested in the
unconscious and the supernatural. James wrote in 1908 that "Peter Quint
and Miss Jessel are not "ghosts" at all, as we now know the ghost, but
goblins, elves, imps, demons as loosely constructed as those of the old
trials for witchcraft; if not, more pleasingly, fairies of the
legendary order, wooing their victims forth to see them dance under the
moon." Virginia Woolf thought that Henry James's beings have nothing in
common with the violent old ghosts <font face="Symbol">-</font> "the blood-stained captains, the white horses, the headless ladies of dark lanes and windy commons." 
Edmund Wilson was convinced that the story was "primarily intended as a 
characterization of the governess." </p>

Swedenborg's ideas run heavily in Henry James' family. His father was a
Swedenborgian and William James, the son of Henry James, showed in his
philosophical works a deep understanding of Swedenborg. - </font><b><font size="2">Note</font></b><font size="2">: In her study </font><i><font size="2">A Private Life of Henry James </font></i><font size="2">(1999),
Lyndall Gordon has focused on two relationships James had with two
women. Minny Temple, his cousin, died at the age of 24 of tuberculosis.
James used her as the model for such characters as Daisy Miller and
Isabel Archer. The relationship with Constance 'Fenimore' Woolson
lasted 14 years - she was nicknamed Fenimore for her great-uncle James.
Woolson died perhaps by her own volition: she fell to her death in
Venice from a bedroom window. </font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">

screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, starring Nick Nolte and Uma Thurman. </font><b></b><font size="2"><b>"Much
of the dialogue in Ms. Jhabvala's carefully wrought screenplay voices
feelings that remain unspoken in the novel, and this is the movie's
biggest problem. No matter how well the characters' thoughts have been
translated into speech, the act of compressing their rich, complex
inner lives into dialogue without resorting to voice-over narration
inevitably tends to cheapen them and turn a drama about the revelation
of hidden truths into the terser, more commonplace language of an
intelligent soap opera." </b>(Stephen Holden in The New York Times, April 27, 2001) </font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"></font>
