<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author who examined the psychology of lonely, isolated people. McCullers published only eight books. Her best 
known novels are <em>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (</em>1940), which she wrote at the age of twenty-two, and&nbsp;<em>Reflections in a Golden Eye </em>&nbsp;(1942),
set in a military base. Both of the books have been filmed. Although
McCullers depicted homosexual characters and she had female lovers, she
dealt with the theme of homosexuality in a wider context of alienation
and dislocation. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The late autumn sun laid a radiant haze
over the new sodded winter grass of the lawn, and even in the woods the
sun shone through places where the leaves were not so dense, to make
fiery golden patterns on the ground. The suddenly the sun was gone.
There was a chill in the air and a light, pure wind. It was time for
retreat. From far away came the sound of the bugle, clarified by
distance and echoing in the woods with a lost hollow tone. The night
was near at hand." </b>(from <i>Reflections in a Golden Eye</i>)<b></b></font></blockquote>
<p>Lula Carson Smith (Carson McCullers) was born in Columbus, Georgia,
the daughter of a well-to-do watchmaker and jeweler of French Huguenot
extraction. From the age of five McCullers took piano lessons and at
the age of 17 she moved to New York to study piano at Juilliard School
of Music. However, she never attended the school&nbsp;&#8211; she managed to
lose the money set aside for her tuition. McCullers worked in menial
jobs and studied creative writing at Columbia and New York
universities. In 1936 she published in <i>Story </i>magazine an autobiographical piece, 'Wunderkind,' which depicted a musical prodigy's failure and adolescent insecurity. </p>
<p>In 1937 she married Reeves McCullers, a failed author. Before the wedding 
she him told her parents that she did not want to marry him until she first had 
experienced sex with him. "The sexual experience was not like D.H. Lawrence," 
she later said. "No grand explosions or colored lights, but it gave me a chance to 
know Reeves better, and really learn to love him." They moved to North Carolina, 
living there for two years. During this time she 
wrote <i>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</i>, a novel in the Southern Gothic 
tradition. The title, suggested by McCullers's editor, was taken from Fiona 
MacLeod's poem 'The Lonely Hunter'. </p><p>Set
in the 1930s in a small mill town, similar to Charlotte of the 1930s,
the story tells about an adolescent girl with a passion to study music.
Other major characters include an unsuccessful socialist agitator, a
black physician struggling to maintain his personal dignity, a widower
who owns a café, and John Singer, the deaf-mute protagonist, who is
confidante of people who talk to him about loneliness and misery. When
Singer's Greek mute friend goes insane, Singer is left alone. He takes
a room with the Kelly family, where he is visited by the town's
misfits. After discovering that his mute friend has died, Singer shoots
himself &#8211; there is no one left to communicate with him. </p>
<p><i>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</i> was interpreted as an anti-fascist book when it came out. In 1968 it was filmed with Alan Arkin in the lead role. <i>Reflections in a Golden Eye</i>
was directed by John Huston (1967), starring Marlon Brando and
Elizabeth Taylor. Some of the film was shot in New York City and on
Long Island, where Huston was permitted to use an abandoned Army
installation. Many of the interiors and some of the exteriors were done
in Italy. <font size="2"><b></b></font>"I first met Carson McCullers
during the war when I was visiting Paulette Goddard and Burgess
Meredith in upstate New York," said Huston in <i>An Open Book</i>
(1980). "Carson lived nearby, and one day when Buzz and I were out for
a walk she hailed us from her doorway. She was then in her early
twenties, and had already suffered the first of series of strokes that
made her an invalid before she was thirty. I remember her as a fragile
thing with great shining eyes, and a tremor in her hand as she placed
it in mine. It wasn't palsy, rather a quiver of animal timidity. But
there was nothing timid or frail about the manner in which Carson
McCullers faced life. And as her affections multiplied, she only grew
stronger." </p>
<p>McCullers's marriage turned out to be unlucky. Both she and her
husband had homosexual relationships. They separated in 1940. McCullers
moved to New York to live with George Davis, the editor of <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>.
In Brooklyn McCullers became a member of the art commune February
House. Among their friends were W.H. Auden, Paul and Jane Bowles, and
the burlesque stripper Gipsy Rose Lee. After World War II McCullers
lived mostly in Paris. Her close friends during these years included <a href="capote.htm">Truman Capote</a> and <a href="williams.htm">Tennessee Williams</a>. </p>
<p>In 1945 McCullers remarried with Reeves. Three years later McCullers
became so depressed she attempted suicide. Reeves killed himself in a
Paris hotel in 1953 with an overdose of sleeping pills. McCullers's
bitter-sweet play&nbsp;<em>The Square Root of Wonderful</em>&nbsp;(1958) was an attempt to examine these traumatic experiences. <em>The Member of the Wedding </em>(1946) described the feelings of a young girl at her brother's wedding. 
The Broadway production of the novella had a successful run in 1950-51. 
McCullers's best 
short stories include 'Madame Zilensky and the King of Finland,' collected in&nbsp;<em>The Ballad of the Sad Café </em>
(1951). The title story, a novella, tells of a strong 
woman, Miss Amelia Evans, who falls in love with a hunchback, Cousin Lymon. At 
the end he destroys Miss Amelia's cafe with his lover, her former husband. 
</p>
<p>McCullers suffered throughout her life from several
illnesses&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;she had contracted rheumatic fever at the age of
fifteen and a series of strokes left her a virtual invalid in her early
30's.&nbsp;Carson McCullers died in New York on September 29, 1967,
after a stroke and a resultant brain haemorrhage.&nbsp;Her final novel
was <em>Clock Without Hands </em>(1961), which was a bestseller, but 
received mixed review. <em>Sweet as a Picle and Clean as a Pig </em>(1964) was a 
collection of children's verse. 
Her unfinished autobiography,&nbsp;<em>Illumination and&nbsp;Night&nbsp;Glare</em>&nbsp; (1999), she 
dictated during her final months. </p>
<p>Although McCullers's <i>oeuvre</i> is often described 
as "Southern Gothic," she produced her famous works after 
leaving the South. Her eccentric characters suffer from loneliness that 
is interpreted with deep empathy. In a discussion with the Irish critic 
and writer Terence De Vere White she confessed: "Writing, for me, is 
a search for God." This search was not acknowledged by all of her 
colleagues &#8211; Arthur Miller dismissed her a "minor author," 
but Gore Vidal praised her work as ''one of the few satisfying achievements 
of our second-rate culture.'' </p>
