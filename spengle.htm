<p> German philosopher of history, whose famous work, <i>The Decline of the West</i>
(1918-1922) combined Nietzschean poetic argument with a pessimistic
view of the permanence of humankind's achievements. According to
Spengler, Western culture is doomed, as other cultures have been before
it, and has already entered its degenerate last stage. The idea of
decline was in fact ancient &#8211; Hesiod wrote of the lost golden age in
the 8th century BC &#8211; but Spengler gave to the theme the most eloquent
and prophetic interpretation. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Is there a logic of history? Is there,
beyond all the casual and incalculable elements of the separate
elements of the separate events, something that we may call a
metaphysical structure of historic humanity, something that is
essentially independent of the outward forms &#8211; social, spiritual and
political &#8211; which we see so clearly? Are not these actualities indeed
secondary or derived from that something? Does world-history present to
the seeing eye certain grand traits, again and again, with sufficient
constancy to justify certain conclusions? And if so, what are the
limits to which reasoning from such premisses may be pushed?"</b> (from T</font><i><font size="2">he Decline of the West</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Oswald Spengler was born at Blankenburg am Hars, the son of Bernhard
Spengler, a post office official, and Pauline (Grantzow) Spengler. The
atmosphere of his childhood home was emotionally reserved, and in his
loneliness Spengler found consolation from the thoughts of giant
cultural personalities: Richard Wagner, Henrik Ibsen, Ernst Haeckel,
and Friendrich Nietzsche. After attending the Halle Latin School,
Spengler studied at the universities of Munich, Berlin, and Halle,
where his main subject was mathematics. He also read philosophy,
history and art. In 1903 Spengler failed his oral exams which was a
deep blow to his academic career plans, though he passed six months
later. </p>
<p>Spengler received his Ph.D. in 1904. His thesis at Berlin was <i>Der metaphysische Grundgedanke der Heraklitischen Philosophie</i>.
In 1905 he suffered a nervous breakdown. He worked as a teacher in
Saarbrücken and Düsseldorf and from 1908 to 1911 he taught science,
German, history, and mathematics in a high school in Hamburg. After
moving to Munich, where he lived on his inheritance, he started to
write the first volume of his magnum opus, <i>Gestalt und Wirklichkeit</i>. Crucial for the work was the Agadir crisis, in which the arrival of the German warship <i>Panther </i>at
Agadir triggered a political struggle between France and Germany over
control of Morocco. Germany was forced to back down and Spengler
believed that it signalled the end of that era. After seeing in a
bookshop a volume entitled<i> The Decline of Antiquity</i>, written by Otto Seeck, he knew what name he would give his own book. </p>
<p>Spengler's early years in Munich were marked by poverty and
loneliness. He lived in a lugubrious room, spent his mornings at the
public library, lunched in cheap cafeterias, and drank tea. He owned no
books. To earn extra income he wrote to different magazines and worked
as a tutor. He also became known as an outspoken opponent of the Weimar
Republic. <i>Gestalt und Wirklichkeit</i> (Form and Actuality) was
completed in 1914. Wartime delayed its appearance, publishers did not
want to print it, and it was not published until 1917 in Vienna and in
Munich the next year. The first printing published by Wilhelm
Braumuller was only 1,500 copies. <i>Welthistorische Perspektiven</i>
(Perspectives of World History) came out in 1922 together with the
first volume, which Spengler had revised. The work had a huge
commercial success and became one of the most talked about books in
post-war Germany, where defeat in the war was regarded as a national
humiliation, and severe depression seemed to prove Spengler's thesis
right. Spengler himself had believed in victory while writing <i>Form and Actuality</i>. </p>
<p>The grand vision of history in <i>The Decline of the West</i> deeply influenced Spengler's readers between the world wars. Thomas Mann compared its effect on him to that of reading <a href="arthursc.htm">Schopenhauer</a>
for the first time. The work was widely discussed in the 1920s even by
those who knew it only superficially. The German artist George Grosz
says in his book of memoirs,<i> A Small Yes and a Big No</i> (1982)
about his friend, who confessed: "That book is my Bible, Herr Grosz,
even though I don't get much time for reading these days..." In
academic circles <i>The Decline of the West</i> was received with
mixed feelings. Max Weber described Spengler as a "very ingenious and
learned dilettante" and Karl Popper attacked Spengler's thesis as
"pointless".</p>
<p>Spengler's obscure thoughts, intuitionalism and mysticism were easy
targets for his critics. All attempts to find the meaning of history
had been denounced by the positivists and neo-Kantians of the late
nineteenth century as irresponsible metaphysical speculation. This
attitude did not change but was perhaps even hardened after the rise of
neo-positivism and analytic tradition. One of the exceptions was the
Austrian/British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), who
shared Spengler's cultural pessimism, and confessed once that he felt
"intensely the terrible degeneration that had come over the human
spirit in the course of only a hundred years." <a href="gwright.htm">Georg Henrik von Wright</a>,
Wittgenstein's successor at the University of Cambridge, accepted
Spengler's cyclic view of history and wrote in 1951 an essay in which
he compared Spengler and Toynbee. </p>
<p>In <i>Preussentum und Sozialismus</i> (1920) Spengler made a
difference between Marxism and German socialism as first realized in
18th century Prussia, where the rule of the state over all individuals
and classes had been accepted. He advocated the idea that socialism can
be part of the conservative ideology, as exemplified in the Prussian
tradition with its sense of duty toward the fatherland. In 1931 he
published <i>Der Mensch und die Technik</i> in which he warned of the
danger of technology and industrialism and their destructive impact on
culture. Only dreamers, he claimed, ignored this fact.<i> Jahre der Entscheidung </i>(1934) was a bestseller; it sold 150,000 copies, but was condemned by the government. </p>
<p>Spengler's attacks on liberal ideas and institutions was first welcomed by the National Socialists, who wrongly believed that <i>The Decline of the West </i>glorified
militarism. Although Spengler approved parts of the Nazi program he
rejected its unscientific biological doctrines and persecution of the
Jews. In 1933 Spengler met Hitler, whom Spengler &#8211; a conservative
humanist &#8211; found vulgar. Germany didn't want a "heroic tenor but a real
hero," Spengler said. He quarrelled with one of the chief Nazi
theoreticians, Albert Rosenberg, and eventually his pessimism and
remarks about the Führer and his followers led to his isolation and
public silence. </p>
<p>In 1933 Spengler became a member of the Academy of Germany. His last
years Spengler spent in Munich, listening to Beethoven, reading the
works of Shakespeare and Molière, buying several thousand books, and
collecting primitive Persian, Turkish, and Hindu weapons. Occasionally
he made trips to the Harz Mountains and to Italy. Just before his death
Spengler wrote to a friend that in ten years "the German Reich will
probably no longer exist." He died suddenly of a heart attack in Munich
on May 8, 1936 three weeks before his fifty-sixth birthday. His
sister's daughter, Hildegard Kornhardt, Ph.D. edited and published
fragments from Spengler's unfinished works, <i>Reden und Aufsätze </i>(1937) and <i>Gedanken </i>(c. 1941). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is, and has always been, a matter of
knowledge that the expression-forms of world-history are limited in
number, and that eras, epochs, situations, persons, are ever repeating
themselves true to type."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Decline of the West</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Spengler rejected traditional unilinear accounts of historical
development and also causal explanations. Instead he examined history
within the framework of cyclic patterns. "Each culture has its own new
possibilities of self-expression which arise, ripen, decay and never
return." Augustine saw in the City of God a divine plan behind history,
and for Marx the driving force behind historical development was the
class struggle. In Spengler's garden of cultures there is no gardener,
a visible purpose or unifying meaning, except fate, which cannot be
explained. Cultures spring mysteriously into being, they have
morphological similarities but nothing else. </p>
<p>The central theme in <i>The Decline of the West</i> is that all
higher cultures go through a life cycle analogous to that of an organic
evolution, from birth to maturation, and to inevitable decline.
Spengler also used the analogy of four seasons: the spring (birth and
infancy), summer (youth), fall (maturity), and winter (old age and
decay). When Toynbee had in his work <i>A Study of History </i>(1914-1961)
over twenty great cultures, Spengler found eight which are
self-contained and have a distinctive "soul" or "style" &#8211; the Egyptian,
the Chinese, the Ancient Semitic (Babylonian), the Indian, the Magian
(roughly, Arabic), the Apollonian or Greco-Roman, the Faustian or
Western, and Mayan. Each of these units has an identical life-cycle
lasting some thousand years. </p>
<p>What really separated Spengler from the majority of historians was
his method, the "form-language of human history," his concern to see
analogies between different cultural epochs. "The means whereby to
identify dead forms is Mathematical Law. The means whereby to
understand living forms is Analogy," he wrote. Thus he regarded
Pythagoras, Mohammed and Cromwell as the embodiments of the one and
same puritanical movement, compared modern times to late antiquity and
saw similarities between the electoral campaigns of Rome and the United
States, and forecast that the Western world would face the same chaos
as ancient Egypt in 1800-1550 BC. Spengler acknowledged his debt to
Goethe, who followed in his poem 'Die Metamorphose der Pflanze' the
development of the plant-form from the leaf through a series of
intermediate forms. Goethe's poem also inspired Wittgenstein's views in
<i>Logik, Sprache, Philosophie</i> where he dealt with the morphology of the use of an expression. In <i>Culture and Value</i> he wrote: "Spengler could be better understood if he said: I am <i>comparing </i>different
cultural epochs with the lives of families; within a family there is a
family resemblance, though you will also find a resemblance between
members of different families; family resemblance differs from the
other sort of resemblance in such and such ways, etc."</p>
<p>Spengler saw that the style of a Soul comes out in the higher
Cultures, above all in art, mathematics, philosophy, sciences, music,
drama, and poetry, and reflects the essence of the soul of that
particular Culture. "There are several number-worlds as there are
several Cultures. We find an Indian, an Arabian, a Classical as Western
type of mathematical thought, and corresponding with each, a type of
number - each type fundamentally peculiar and unique, an expression of
a specific world-feeling..." Each of the civilizations has its special
driving idea (Urphänomen) &#8211; Western culture is characterized by its
restless thrust toward the infinite. In architecture this can be seen
in Gothic cathedrals and in painting in the use of depth perspective,
parallel lines which meet in infinity. Spengler believed that his own
era, Faustian, had reached its last stage. Signs of cultural decay
were, among other things, atonal music, art produced for oversensitive
connoisseurs, manipulation of the public opinion by mass media,
imperialism, and Caesarism", a universal, formless will to power, which
breaks the dictatorship of plutocracy and its political ally,
democracy. According to Spengler, Russia did not belong to Western
culture. A Faustian soul looks upward, a Russian soul toward the
horizon. Thus Russian "Urphänomen" is the boundless steppe. </p>
<p> Spengler's impact was in his time immense but brief. In the West,
where progress and&nbsp; economic growth have been regarded as one and
the same thing, Spengler's work has been "redicovered" during times of
economic turmoil, and then forgotten for a period. In the 1960s a new
interest arose toward<i> The Decline of the West</i> when its abridged
English version was published. It was also said that Henry Kissinger
gave the work to President Nixon as a bedside book. <br>
</p>
      <p>Although Spengler is little read today, the idea of cyclical
history has not been lost. It has been picked up some modern authors,
including Paul Kennedy (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</span>, 1987) and Jared Diamond (<span style="font-style: italic;">Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</span>, 2005). Spengler's "drama
of a number of mighty Cultures . . . each having its own idea, its own
passions, its own life" was echoed in Samuel Huntington's famous book <span style="font-style: italic;">The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</span>
(1996). At the turn of the millennium Spengler's prophesies received in
Europe less attention than Nostradamus's predictions and Karl Marx's
anticipation of the future form of society. Niall Ferguson has asked in <span style="font-style: italic;">Civilization. The West and the Rest</span>
(2011) that what if "historical time is less like the slow and
predictable changing of seasons and more like the elastic time of our
dreams? Above all, what if collapse is not centuries in the making but
strikes a civilizations suddenly, like a thief in the night?" <br>
