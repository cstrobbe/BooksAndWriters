      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->One of the most important
figures
in 20th century Turkish literature and one of the first Turkish poets
to use more or less free verse. Hikmet's works were widely translated
both in the Communist&nbsp;East and the West&nbsp;during his lifetime.
However, in his home country Hikmet&nbsp;remained&nbsp;a controversial
figure due to&nbsp;his social criticism and commitment to Marxism.
Spending some 17 years in prisons,&nbsp;Hikmet once&nbsp;called poetry
"the bloodiest of the arts."&nbsp; He was the only major writer to
speak out against the Armenian massacres in 1915 and 1922. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><font size="2">"I mean you must take living so
seriously </font><br>
        </strong><font size="2"><strong>that even at seventy, for
example, you will plant olive</strong><strong>s &#8211;<br>
        </strong></font><strong><font size="2">and not so they'll be
left for your children either, </font><br>
        <font size="2">but because even though you fear death you don't
believe it, </font><br>
        <font size="2">because living, I mean, weighs heavier." </font></strong><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'On Living', 1948) </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Nazim Hikmet was born Mehmet Hazim in Salonica, Ottoman Empire
(now Thessaloniki). His father, Nazim Hikmet Bey, was a civil servant,
whose father Nazim Pasha, had been a leading figure in the Ottoman
civil service. Hikmet's mother, Aisha Dshalila (Cecile), was a painter,
partly of Polish, partly of Huguenot descent. In 1905, Hikmet Bey was
obliged to resing from his post at the foreign service. For a period
the family lived in Aleppo, where Hikmet Bey invested his money in a
unsucessful project. After returning to Istanbul started a new
business, and went bankrupt. In 1909 he was appointed translator in the
press department of the Foreign Ministry.&nbsp;He then&nbsp;
worked as managing director of a publishing firm and the&nbsp;manager
of a cinema. Hikmet Bey died in 1932. </p>
      <p>While still at school, Hikmet began writing poems. He studied
briefly at the French-language Galatasary Lycée in Istanbul and
attended the Naval War School, but dropped out in 1920n because of ill
health. Soon after, he wrote a lampoon&nbsp;about the British and
became involved with his friends in&nbsp; gun smuggling to Mustafa
Kemal.&nbsp;During the war of independence,&nbsp;Hikmet went to
Anatolia to join Atatürk and then worked as a teacher at a school in
Bolu. He studied sociology and economics at the University of Moscow
(1921-28) and joined&nbsp; in the 1920s the Turkish Communist Party. In
Turkey he was sentenced in prison in absentia. While in the Soviet
Union,&nbsp;Hikmet had a short-lived marriage to Nüzhet Nazim, a
student, and then he lived together with Ludmilla Yurchenko in a
second-floor flat in Tverskaya Boulevard. Ludmilla was a dentist,
Hikmet referred to her as Dr. Lena. </p>
      <p>After returning to Turkey in 1928 without a visa
Hikmet&nbsp;continued to contribute&nbsp;to newspapers and periodicals
and write plays. At the Ipek Film Studios he wrote scripts under the
name&nbsp; Mümtaz Osman&nbsp;and directed films. Because of his
unauthorized re-entry, he was sentenced to a prison term but pardoned
in 1935 in a general amnesty. In his cell he he wrote a long poem,
'Giaconda and Si-Ya-U', about Leonardo's famous Mona Lisa, the Giaconda
of the title, who fells in love with a young Chinese man visiting the
Louvre museum in Paris. Miraculously, she escapes from the wall of the
museum, and joins revolutionaries. At the end she dies in flames. "And
so it was that in Shanghai, on this day of death / The Florentine
Gioconda lost / A smile more famous than Florentine." </p>
      <p>In 1935&nbsp;Hikmet married Piraye Altinogly, a woman with
striking red hair, whose father was editor of the newspaper <em>Tercuman-i
Ahval</em>. With Piraye he had two children; she had also two children
from her first husband, Vedat Örfi Bengü, who had moved to Paris. Some
of his best poems Hikmet wrote&nbsp;to her. </p>
      <p>Hikmet was condemned in 1938&nbsp;to prison for 28 years and
four months for anti-Nazi and anti-Franco activities. According to the
Military Court, he had provoked naval soldiers to rebellion. Hikmet
spent the following 12 years in different prisons, unable to publish
his work. During this period he&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love
with&nbsp;Münevver Andac,&nbsp;the daughter of his uncle. In the poem
'Some Advice to Those Who Will Serve Time in Prison'&nbsp;(1949),
Hikmet expressed&nbsp;his will to survive: "To think of roses and
gardens inside is bad, / to think of seas and mountains is good. / Read
and write without rest, / and I also advise weaving / and making
mirrors." <font size="2">(tr. Randy Blasing and Mutlu Konuk, in <font size="3"><font size="2"><em>Things I Didn't Know I Loved</em>, 1975</font></font>)</font></p>
      <p>In 1950, to hasten his release after international protests,
Hikmet&nbsp;went into a huger strike at the <span class="st">Pasakapisi&nbsp;prison
in Üsküdar</span>. Upon his release, Hikmet divorced Piraye, moved
together with Münevver, and began to work at the Ipek Film
Studios.&nbsp; Being constantly under the surveillance of the police
and&nbsp;in fear of an attempt on his life, Hikmet eventually
escaped&nbsp; from Turkey in a small boat. His wife and his son, Memet,
were not allowed to&nbsp;travel abroad.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>After losing his Turkish citizenship,&nbsp;Hikmet lived in the
Soviet Union and other socialist countries. In 1950 he shared with
Pablo Neruda the Soviet Union's International Peace Prize. Hikmet
became a Polish citizen and from 1951 lived his remaining days in
Sofia, Warsaw, and finally in Moscow. In spite of his heart disease and
the warnings of his doctors he also travelled in Africa, China, Cuba,
and spent time in Paris, Rome, and Prague. An administrator of <span class="st">the communist-dominated </span>World Peace Council (WPC),
he participated in conferences around the world. </p>
      <p>From&nbsp;the early 1950s,&nbsp;Hikmet's&nbsp;companion
was&nbsp;Galina Grigoryevna Kolesnikova, a doctor, whom he met in the
Barvikha Sanatorium. After separation, he married a young woman named
Vera Tulyakova; born in 1932, she was thirty years his
junior.&nbsp;Vera was the last great love of his life. With
her&nbsp;Hikmet wrote for the Soyuz Multifilm Institute a&nbsp;scenario
for a puppet film, entitled <em>A Cloud in Love</em>. Many of Hikmet's
poems,&nbsp;composed during the years of exile, are nostalgic. 'Paris
Without You' (1958), which he wrote during his visit to France,
reflected his longing for Vera. While in Warsaw he imagined about
platans, "white houses" and "an autumn morning in a wine yard"&nbsp;&#8211;
there are no wine yards in Warsaw and the city is not white. A poem
about Donau brings his thoughts to Istanbul. Broken in
health,&nbsp;Hikmet died on June 3, 1963 in Moscow, where he was
buried. Just a few months before his death Hikmet had written a poem,
in which he bids his farewell to his neighbors in his Moscow apartment
building, and ponders over how his coffin is to be transported down
from the fourth floor. ´</p>
      <p>Hikmet's first poems appeared in the 1920s, but he had started
to write earlier. In Moscow he saw a poem by Mayakovsky, and although
he did not understand Russian, the free-flowing lines fascinated his
imagination. Hikmet also worked&nbsp;with Mayakovsky at the satirical
Metla theater.</p>
      <p>Hikmet combined Turkish traditional poetry with avant-gardist
trends, and deeply influenced Turkish literature in the 1920s and
1930s. His own passionate poetic voice Hikmet found in his twenties. He
proclaimed that "the artist is the engineer of the human soul." In 1936
he published one of his most famous works, <span style="font-style: italic;">Simavne Kad&#305;s&#305; O&#287;lu &#350;eyh Bedreddin Destan&#305;</span>
(The Epic of Sheikh Dedreddin), which depicted a 15th
century revolutionary religious leader in Anatolia. Among his later
major works is the five-volume <span style="font-style: italic;">Memleketimden
&#304;nsan Manzaralar&#305;</span>
(1966-67), a 20,000 line epic. In his early poems Hikmet never used
completely free verse.&nbsp;Typical for his poems is change of metre
and irregular use of rhymes. </p>
      <p>As a playwright Hikmet applied the techniques of Brecht's epic
theater. His Marxist-inspired dramas enjoyed success in the Soviet
Union and other communist countries. Hikmet's first published play <span style="font-style: italic;">Ocakbasi</span> (1932, By the Fireside),
was a verse drama about a poet's
love. In 1932 he made a strong impact with his innovative play <span style="font-style: italic;">Kafatas&#305; </span>and consolidated his
reputation with <span style="font-style: italic;">Unutulan Adam</span>
(1934), which
demonstrated the dubiousness of fame and the frequent discrepancy
between one's success in the world and one's unhappiness in private
life. </p>
      <p>Other dramatic works in the 1930s and 1940s include <span style="font-style: italic;">Bir Ölü Evi </span>(1932, The House of
the Deceased), which focuses on the greed and
hypocrisy of a middle-class family. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ferhad
ile &#350;irin</span> (1945,&nbsp;
Ferhad and Sirin), written in a prison and based on a Persian-Turkish
love legend, has been adapted into a three-act ballet and filmed twice.
      <span style="font-style: italic;">&#304;van &#304;vanoviç Var m&#305;yd&#305;, Yok
muydu?</span> (1956),&nbsp;published shortly after
Stalin's death, attacked the cult of personality and the new hierarchy
that replaced the old. This play, which&nbsp;was performed for the
first time in Moscow, was compared to <a href="majakovs.htm">Mayakovsky</a>'s
      <i>The Bedbug </i>(1928), a social satire. <span style="font-style: italic;">Demokles'in K&#305;l&#305;c&#305;&nbsp;</span>
(1974,&nbsp; Sword of Damocles) depicted the threat of nuclear
holocaust, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sabahat</span> (1977)
revealed the exploitation of the
hardworking people by the civic leaders. </p>
      <p>Hikmet's poetry and plays gained a wide popularity in France
and Greece, and in 1970 he received critical praise from some prominent
American poets. In Turkey the ban on Hikmet's works was
not&nbsp;lifted&nbsp;until 1964. A vast numbers of books and articles
about the author and his work were published in the late 1970s and
early 1980s. However, the multi-volume complete works project, started
in 1968,&nbsp;remained still incomplete by the early 1980s.
The&nbsp;first complete edition of&nbsp;Hikmet's poems appeared in
Bulgaria in the 1960s. </p>
      <p>Hikmet did not consider his theater works to be of major
importance, but during the years in Moscow he met such Russian theater
geniuses as Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Vachtangov and Tairov. The main
themes in his dramas are loneliness, betrayal and the evils of
capitalism. Also many of his poems have been dramatized and staged. In
1972 Paris's Théâtre de la Liberté offered a production called <i>Légendes
à Venir</i>, which was a mixture of the author's poems and Aziz Nesin's
short stories. Hikmet's novels do not compare in quality to his poetry
and plays. His collection of tales,<span style="font-style: italic;">
Sevdal&#305; Bulut</span> (1968), and his
anthology of newspaper columns, <span style="font-style: italic;">It
Ürür Kervan Yürür</span> (1965), represent
his better production. Hikmet's three volumes correspondence,
posthumously published, reveal the author as a master letter writer. </p>
