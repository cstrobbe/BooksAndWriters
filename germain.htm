<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Adventurer, alchemist, and
diplomat, whose mysterious origin created a legend around him. Comte de
Saint Germain was rumored to have lived 2,000 years. The legend of St
Germain, "the man who does not die," was born in the mid-1700s. Since
then, endless speculations and sightings of the Count after his death
has continued. St Germain was also known by such figures as <a href="../../../casanova.htm">Casanova</a>,
Cagliostro, and Horace Walpole. The Russian writer Aleksandr Pushkin
(1799-1837) mentions him in the short story 'The Queen of Spades'
(1834): </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You have heard of Count St. Germain,
about whom so many marvelous stories are told. You know that he
represented himself as the Wandering Jew, as the discoverer of the
elixir of life, of the philosopher's stone, and so forth. Some laughed
at him as a charlatan; but Casanova, in his memoirs, says that he was a
spy. But be that as it may, St. Germain, in spite of the mystery
surrounding him, was a very fascinating person, and was much sought
after in the best circles of society. Even to this day my grandmother
retains an affectionate recollection of him, and becomes quite angry if
anyone speaks disrespectfully of him." </b>(tr.&nbsp; T. Keane) </font></blockquote>
<p>Little is known of Count Saint-Germain's birth. He was said to be
descended from an Alsatian Jew, a Portuguese Jew, a tax-gatherer in
Rotondo, or the King of Portugal. Saint-Germain himself did not help to
elucidate the enigma of his true identity. It has been also alleged,
that he was the son of Prince Franz-Leopold Rakoczy (or Ragoczy) of
Transylvania (1676-1735), or Juan Tomás Enríquez de Cabrera and Maria
Anna von Neuburg (1667-1740), or Marquis de Rivarolo (1669-1749), or
Sultan Mustapha II (1664-1703). Later he determined to take the name of
Saint-Germain from the little town of San Germano, or from the holy
brother, St. Germanus. Whoever he was, he was well educated, and at
least for some decades he seemed relatively wealthy.<u></u></p>
<p>Saint Germain entered the international scene in a period, which was
full of contradictions. The rationalism of the Enlightenment,
represented by such writers as Voltaire, Goethe, and Rousseau, was
counterbalanced by sentimental and romantic, even reactionary
tendencies. Count Alessandro Cagliostro (1743-1795), a celebrated
figure in the courts of Europe, was as much charlatan as his detractors
alleged. Cagliostoro's real name was Guiseppe Balsamo; he possibly met
St Germain in Sicily. Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) impressed Queen
Louisa Ulrica, sister of Frederick the Great, by delivering a private
message from her dead brother. François, Duke of Lorraine married Maria
Theresa of Austria, and was the first European prince to publicise his
Freemasonic affiliations. Also St Germain was associated with
Freemasons. In the imperial palace, François had an alchemical
laboratory. And as always, the great public was responsive to fantastic
stories. In Germany, the figure of the fabulous <a href="../../../munchh.htm">Baron Muchhausen</a> created a vogue for tall tales. </p>
<p>St Germain found his most ardent admirers from the arictocratic
circles. He had an exceptional memory and he could repeat a page of
print after one reading. The serious-minded middle-class viewed him
with some disdain, as the English letter-writer and aesthetician Horace
Walpole in 1745: "The other day they seized an odd man who goes by the
name of Count St Germain. He has been here these two years, and will
not tell who he is or whence, but professes that he does not go by his
right name. He sings and plays the violin wondefully, is mad, and not
very sensible." </p>
<p>At the French court St Germain was seen about 1748. He was was an
ordinary looking man of medium height, he had regular features, black
hair, and he was apparently a fine conversationalist. "He looks like a
Spaniard of high birth," wrote one of his contemporaries. In one
painting he has been portrayed wearing a fashionable wig. St German
looked in 1743 about forty or forty-five years old, like a man of his
age if he was born at the turn of the century. It was said that he
spoke German, English, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish very well, and
French with a Piedmontese accent. According to some sources, scholars
were surprised by his facility in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Arabic and
Chinese. However, there is no information if he spoke Sanskrit with a
Piedmontese accent. <br>
</p>
      <p>Casanova met St Germain in 1757 in Paris at a dinner party, and admitted in his&nbsp;<em>Mémoirs</em>&nbsp;that
the famous Count talked with an ease and charm which captivated him.
Moreover, St Germain said, that "he had the secret of melting diamonds,
so that from ten or twelve small ones he could make a large one of the
first water, without losing a particle of their weight." Casanova &#8211;
himself a master storyteller &#8211; dismissed St Germain as an impostor. </p>
<p>Voltaire's famous statement from 1758 in his ironic letter to
Frederick of Prussia, that St Germain is "a man who never dies, and who
knows everything," has been often used out of its original context. It
is not a declaration of belief in St Germain's immortality. Voltaire
says that he has not been told any secrets and refers to St Germain's
role in political manouverings&nbsp;&#8211; "who will probably have the
honour of seeing your Majesty in the course of fifty years." </p>
<p>Madame de Pompadour and of Louis XV were amused by St Germain,
although he was accused of being an English spy. He told that he had
lived thousands of years and had known even Jesus Christ. However, they
must have been aware, that the Bible did not prove or disprove his
stories. According to an anecdote, since St Germain claimed to have
discovered the secret of immortality, his valet also claimed the share
that knowledge. When asked whether it was true, that his master had
been present at the Cana in Galilee, where Jesus Christ turned water
into wine, the valet responded: "You forget, sir, that I have only been
in the Comte's service for a century." <br>
</p>
      <p>St Germain was a Catholic. If he believed in the transmigration of the soul, it was a Buddhist doctrine, which also the <a href="../../../pythagor.htm">Pythagoreanists</a>
shared, but it seems that he only claimed that he was very old. This
did not put him in a collision course with the authorities of the
church. Cagliostro, sometimes considered St Germain's pupil, was not so
lucky&nbsp;&#8211; he was caught by the Inquisition in Rome and sentenced to
death. He spent four years in a solitary confinement and died in
imprisonment in 1795. Casanova wrote of St Germain and of Cagliostro in
<em>Le soliloque d'un penseur</em> (1786) and when he was informed that
Cagliostro was in prison at San Leo, he said: "Twenty years ago, I told
Cagliostro not to set his foot in Rome, and if he had followed this
advice he would not have died miserably in a Roman prison." </p>

<p>St Germain claimed to possess the secret of eternal youth, one of
the two traditional goals of alchemy. St Germain's accounts of his
adventures had also connections to the legend of the Wandering Jew, a
well known Christian tale. Its first written version was printed in
Bologna in 1223. To Madame de Pompadour, mistress of Louis XV, St
Germain recounted anecdotes of the court of the Valois as if he had
been there an eyewitness. Once he claimed that he had met Queen of
Sheba and Cleopatra. "Sometimes I amuse myself, not by <em>making</em> people believe, but by <em>letting</em>
them believe, that I have lived in the most remote period," he
explained to Mme. de Pompadour.&nbsp;Eventually she become interested
in his "elixir of life" and started to use it, assuring the King, that
she felt she would grow no older. </p>
<p>St Germain's diplomatic blunders in the peace negotiation between
France and England led him into conflict with the powerful Duc de
Choiseul. After escaping to England, he lived in the Netherlands, and
possibly in Russia, where Catherine the Great had seized the power.
Little is known of his life during the following years&nbsp;&#8211; perhaps
he went to his home. In some point his paths must have crossed with his
countryman, Charles d'Eon de Beaumont, a diplomat, writer, spy, and
Freemason, but there is no evidence of joint adventures. D'Eon is often
called the patron saint of transvestites. St Germain was seen in France
again in 1774. When the minister von Wurmb met St Germain in May 1777
in Lepzig, he estimated that the Count was between 60 and 70 years old.
</p>
<p>His last years St Germain lived under the patronage of Prince
Charles of Hesse-Cassel in Schleswig, Germany. At that time, he had
spent most of his fortune, sold his precious diamonds, and he suffered
from rheumatism. St German died on February 27th, 1784, according to
the church register of Eckernförde. He was known under the name of
Comte de St Germain and Weldon, sometimes written Welldown, Wethlone,
Welldone, or Woeldone. His tombstone in Eckenförde read, "He who called
himself the Comte de St Germain and Welldone, of whome there is no
other information, has been buried in this church." The Rosicrucians
claim that the Comte is still alive and that he was once known as Sir
Francis Bacon (1561-1626). <br>
</p>
      <p>The original manuscript of St Germain's <i>Trinosophia</i>, a work on cabalistic, hermetic, and alchemical mysteries, is in the Bibliotheque de Troyes.
'Sonnet sur la Création,' a modest poem attributed to St Germain, was published in 1795. A book of memoir, <i>Souvenirs sur Marie-Antoinette</i>
(1836) by Comtesse d'Adhémar, claimed that St Germain was seen in
Venice some years after his death. However, the work was a forgery,
written by one Lamothe-Langon, whose specialty was to produce forged memoirs. Baron de Gleichen tells in<i> Souvenirs de Charles Henri, baron de Gleichen</i>
(1868), that according to his acquaintances, St Germain had in 1710 the
appearance of a man of fifty years old. De Gleichen's information is
just hearsay.<u> </u></p>

<p><u></u>In Aleksandr Pushkin short story' The Queen of Spades' a
young aristocratic woman, Countess Anna Fedorovna, asks St Germain's
help&nbsp;&#8211; she has lost much money at the card table. St Germain tells
her a secret of the cards, which helps her to retrieve her loss
completely. She keeps the secret. Decades later a young man becomes
obsessed with it, and causes her death. Eventually she returns as a
ghost and gets her revenge. The young man loses his reason. Pushkin
never met the enigmatic Count, but he knew his legend well and brought
another angle to it: St Germain can tell the future. In Rainer Maria
Rilke's fictional autobiography, <i>Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Lauridts Brigge</i>
(1910), St Germain is called Marquis von Belmare, who believes in the
past: "Aber es gab natuerlich genug, die ihm uebelnahmen, dass er an
die Vergangenheit nur glaubte, wenn sie in ihm war. Das konnten sie
nicht begreifen, dass der Kram nur Sinn hat, wenn man damit geboren
wird." In these works St Germain is only a side character. The American
writer Chelsea Quinn Yarbro has written a number of novels, where the
Count is the protagonist. </p>
<p>Saint-Germain's knowledge of diamonds, precious stones, and
chemistry impressed his contemporaries; his dyeing skills were widely
acknowledged. Graf Karl Cobenzl wrote in a letter in 1763, that he saw
how St Germain made some experiments, "of which the most important were
the transmutation of iron into a metal as beautiful as gold". Without
any doubts, the physical goals of alchemy&nbsp;&#8211; the elixir of life and
the Philosopher's Stone&nbsp;&#8211; fascinated deeply St Germain. The Swiss
psychiatrist Carl Jung has argued that alchemy also corresponds to
psychology. "What the alchemists called 'matter' was in reality the
unconscious self," Jung claimed. Deliberate mystification can be pure
bluff to exploit the credulous or projection of unresolved inner
tensions. St Germain was secretive about his past, he had several
identities, and in his occult studies, he perhaps indirectly searched
the truth of himself. </p>
