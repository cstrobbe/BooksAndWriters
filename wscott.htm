<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Writer and poet, a born storyteller and master
of dialogue, one of the greatest historical novelists, whose favorite subject was his native Scotland. 
Scott wrote twenty-seven historical novels. His influence is seen among others in the works 
of <a href="jfcooper.htm">James Fenimore Cooper</a>, <a href="adumas1.htm">Alexandre Dumas</a>, 
and <a href="puskin.htm">Aleksandr Pushkin</a>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Love rules the court, the camp, the grove, </b></font><b><br>

<font size="2">For love is heaven, and heaven is love." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, 1805) </font></blockquote>

<p>Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh, the son of a solicitor Walter Scott and Anne, a daughter of 
professor of medicine. An early illness &#8211; polio &#8211; left him lame in the right leg. Six of his 11 
brothers and sisters died in infancy. However, Scott grew up to be a man over six feet and great 
physical endurance. </p>
<p>Scott's interest in the old Border tales and ballads had early been awakened, and he devoted much 
of his leisure to the exploration of the Border country. His early years Scott spent in Sandy-Know, 
in the residence of his paternal grandfather. There his grandmother told him tales of old heroes. 
At the age of eight he returned to Edinburgh. He attended Edinburgh High School (1779-1783) and 
studied at Edinburgh University arts and law (1783-86, 1789-92). At the age of sixteen he had 
already started to collect old ballads and later translated into English Gottfried Bürger's 
ballads 'The Wild Huntsman' and 'Lenore' and 'Goetz of Berlichingen' (1799) from Johann Wolfgang 
von Goethe's play.  Scott was apprenticed to his father in 1786 and in 1792 he was called to the 
bar. In 1799 he was  appointed  sheriff depute of the county of Selkirk. After an unsuccessful 
love affair with Williamina Belsches of Fettercairn &#8211; she married Sir William Forbes &#8211; Scott married 
in 1797 Margaret Charlotte Charpentier (or Charpenter), daughter of Jean Charpentier of Lyon i
n France.  They had five children. </p>
<p>In 1802-03 appeared Scott's first major work, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span>. 
As a poet Scott rose into fame with the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</span> (1805) 
about an old border country legend. He had burned its first version, when his friends did not 
like it. Scott  returned to the poem in 1802, when a horse had kicked him and he spent three 
days in  bed. <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> became a huge success and made him the most 
popular author of the day. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Marmion</span> (1808), a historical romance in 
tetrameter, set in 1513, and concerning the attempts of Lord Marmion to marry the rich 
Lady Clare. <br>
</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Lady of the Lake</span> (1810) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Rokeby</span> (1813), were followed by Scott's last major 
poem, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lord of the Isles</span>, which came out in 1815. Later Thomas Love Peacock (1785-1866) 
ridiculed in 'The Four Ages of Poetry' Scott, Byron, 
and the Romantic "Lake Poets" Wordsworth and Coleridge: "While the historian 
and the philosopher are advancing in, and accelerating, the progress of knowledge, the poet 
is wallowing in the rubbish of departed ignorance, and raking up the ashes of dead savages 
to find gewgaws and rattles for the grown babies of the age. Mr.Scott digs up the poachers 
and cattle-stealers of the ancient border. Lord Byron cruizes for thieves and pirates on 
the shores of Morea and among the Greek Islands. Mr. Southey wades through ponderous volumes 
of travels and old chronicles..."  Verses from <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>, including 'Hail 
to the Chief who in triumph 
advances!" were put to music by James Sanderson (1769-1841) and became the march 
traditionally played to honor the president of the United States. 
      </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er, </b></font><b><br>

<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Lady of the Lake</font></i><font size="2">, 1810) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1806 Scott became clerk to the Court of Session in Edinburgh &#8211; this work took only a few hours daily 
and half of the year he was free. His long holidays Scott spent at Ashestiel, situated on the  Tweed 
River. To increase his income he started a printing and publishing business with his friend James 
Ballantyne. The firm had in the
1810s  financial difficulties, and Scott spent his time in immense labours for his publishers, 
much of it hack editorial work. Scott also expanded during these years his Abbotsford estate, but it 
was not until 1826 when the final crash came. He accepted all Ballantyne's debts and decided to pay 
them off with his writings &#8211; the sum was £130,000 (millions today). In his diary he wrote: "I 
am become a sort of writing automaton, and truly the joints of my knees, especially the left, are so 
stiff and painful in rising and sitting down, that I can hardly help screaming &#8211; I that was so robust 
and active..." Difficulties lasted the best of Scott's writing career. To be more productive he used 
a massive desk with two desktops and kept two projects going at a time. Although Scott's books were sold 
at prices as high as 31s. 6d., they found much new middle-class readers, and there was no interest in 
lowering the prices. In comparison, low-cost books, booklets, were offered for the "white-collar" 
workers at sixpence apiece, and paperbound books were sold for 5 shillings. </p>
<p>In the 1810s Scott published several novels anonymously or under the
pseudonym Jebediah Cleisbotham or 'Author of Waverley.' He consistently
refused to acknowledge his authorship of the novels and usually opened
them with a tongue-in-cheek account how the manuscrip had been found,
and how the 'Author of Waverley' hand only edited or translated it. <br>
</p>
      <p>From this period date such works as <span style="font-style: italic;">Waverley</span> (1814), dealing with the rebellion 
of 1745, which attempted to restore a Scottish family to the British throne. The book set the classic 
pattern of the historical novel. It had a hero, whose loyalty is split between two rulers and two ways 
of life. Scott continued with<span style="font-style: italic;"> Guy Mannering</span> (1815) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tales of My Landlord</span> (1816), consisting of 
<i>The Black Dwarf</i> and <i>Old Mortality</i>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rob Roy</span> (1817) was a portrait of one of Scotland's 
greatest heroes &#8211; the novel sold out its edition of 10 000 copies in two weeks. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Heart of Midlothian</span>
(1818) was a story of Jeanie Deans's journey to London to appeal on
behalf of her sister who has been wrongfully charged with child murder.
<span style="font-style: italic;">The Bride of Lammermoor</span> (1819), was a novel of loss, love and vengeance, a venture into the gothic genre. <span style="font-style: italic;">A Legend of Montrose</span> (1819) drew a picture of the campaigns of 1644. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ivanhoe</span>
(1819) was set in the reign of Richard I and depicted the rivalry
between the King and his wicked brother John (King 1199-1216). </p>

<blockquote><i>Ivanhoe</i><i></i>, a tale of chivalry, was set in the
age of Richard the Lion-Hearted. Wilfred of Ivanhoe loves Rowena, but
his father plans marry her to Athelstane of Coningsburgh. Ivanhoe
serves with King Richard in the crusades. King's brother John tries to
usurp the throne with the help of Norman barons. Richard appears in
disguise at the tournament at Ashby de la Zouch, where he helps Ivanhoe
to defeat John's knights. At the tournament Sir Brian falls in love
with Rebecca, a beautiful Jewess. She is taken captive with her father
Isaac, Rowena, Ivanhoe, and Cedric by the Norman barons and imprisoned
in Torquilstone. The King and his band of outlaws, among them Robin
Hood, release the prisoners. Rebecca is carried off by Bois-Guilbert
and charged of witchcraft. Ivanhoe appears as her champion, opposing
Bois-Guilbert, who dies. Rebecca, seeing Ivanhoe's love for Rowena,
leaves England with her father. - Michael Ragussis has argued that
Scott's Isaac the Jew and his daughter Rebecca restaged England's
medieval persecution of Jews and criticized the barbarity of
persecution and forced conversion. In the story Rebecca is a healer and
a voice of moderation between Saxon knights and Normans.</blockquote>

<p>In the 1820s appeared <span style="font-style: italic;">Kenilworth</span> (1821), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fortunes of Nigel</span> (1822), <span style="font-style: italic;">Peveril of the Peak</span> (1823), <span style="font-style: italic;">Quentin Durward</span> (1823), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Talisman</span> (1825), <span style="font-style: italic;">Woodstock</span> (1826), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Surgeon's Daughter</span> (1827), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anne of Geierstei</span>
(1829). After the financial crash of 1825-26 the author's anonymity was
destroyed, and he was exposed to the general public as Sir Walter
Scott. He had at least five pen names, including Jebediah Cleisbotham,
Crystal Croftangry, Malachi Malagrowther, Lawrence Templeton, and
Captain Clutterbuck. According to an anecdote, when mortally sick,
Beethoven (1770-1827) hurled away Scott's novel with the cry: "Why, the
fellow writes for money". <br>
</p>
      <p>The quality of Scott's novels had declined drastically by the 1830s.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> A "cloudiness of words and arrangement" made it necessary for Scott to rely on the help of an amanuensis. <span style="font-style: italic;">Count Robert of Paris</span>
(1832) was substantially rewritten by his son-in-law, John Gibson
Lockhart. Scott's friend were worried of his mental health, when he
conceived a plan to kidnap Princess Victoria and install Wellington as
dictator. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Siege of Malta</span>, which Scott wrote in 1831-32, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Il Bizarro</span>
(1832) were not published until 2008. "... it may be hoped that no
literary resurrectionist will ever be guilty of the crime of giving the
to the world," said John Buchan in his life of Sir Walter Scott.  </p>

<p>Scott's historical novels fall into three groups; those set in the background of Scottish history, from <i>Waverly</i> to <i>A Legend of Montrose</i>; a group which takes up themes from the Middle Ages and Reformation times, from <i>Ivanhoe</i> to<i> Talisman</i>, and his remaining books, from <i>Woodstock</i> onwards. Scott's dramatic work include <span style="font-style: italic;">Halidon Hill</span> (1922),<span style="font-style: italic;"> Macduff's Cross</span> (1823), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Doom of Devorgoil</span> (1830), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Auchindrane</span> (1830), which was founded on the case of Mure of Auchindrane in Pitcairn's <i>Ancient Criminal Trials</i>. 
</p>
<p>Scott was created a baronet in 1820. A few years later he founded
the Bannatyne Club, which published old Scottish documents. Scott
visited France in 1826 to collect material for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte</span>, which was published in 9 volumes in 1827. A few years earlier Scott had started to keep his <i>Journal</i>,
recording in undiscourageable spirit his deteriorating health and other
misfortunes. His wife, Lady Scott, died in 1826, and the author himself
had a stroke in 1830. Next year Scott sailed to Italy. In Malta he
wrote one novel and a short story, and in Naples he collected old songs
and ballads. After return to England in 1832, he died on September 21.
Scott was buried beside his ancestors in Dryburgh Abbey. From the
profits of his writings all his debts were ultimately paid. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
 </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Come saddle your horses, and call up your men; </font><br>
<font size="2">Come open the West Port, and let me gang free, </font><br>
<font size="2">And it's room for the bonnets of Bonny Dundee! </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from <i>The Doom of Devorgoil</i>, 1830)</font></blockquote>
<p>Scott's influence as a novelist was profound. He established the
form of the historical novel and his work inspired such writers as
Bulwer-Lytton, G. Eliot, and the Brontës. In the United States the
scholar W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-1963) said in his address in 1926, that he
learned most of Scott's 'Lady of the Lake' by heart at school, adding:
"In after life once it was my privilege to see the lake." In the 1930s
European Marxist critics found Scott again, and interpreted his novels
in term of historicism. The most prominent admirer of Scott was the
Hungarian philosopher and aesthetician György Lucács. Modernist taste
classified Scott to the category of the subliterary or juvenile. "It is
impossible to believe that Scott lives anywhere today," wrote Ford
Madox Ford in his <i>The March of Literature</i> (1938), "he might
perhaps in a doctor's dining-room in Marseilles or Tarascon, in a
child's nursery in Buenos Aires, or a housemaid's pantry on Boston
Hill. Or, of course, in all the <i>sancta sanctorum</i> of all the
professors of the universities of Goettingen and Jena. But his
guilelessness is such that it is impossible to believe that any grown
man could take seriously the adventures of Ivanhoe or Rob Roy."
However, there is also a significant revival of critical and scholarly
interest on Scott. </p>
