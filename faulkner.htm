<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American short story writer, novelist, best
known for his Yoknapatawpha cycle, a <a href="balzac.htm"><i>comédie humaine</i></a> of the American South, which 
started in 1929 with <span style="font-style: italic;">Sartoris</span> / <span style="font-style: italic;">Flags in the Dust</span>&nbsp;and completed with <em>The Mansion</em> (
1959). Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. Faulkner's style is not very easy<font face="Symbol">-</font>in
this he has connections to European literary modernism. His sentences
are long and hypnotic, sometimes he withholds important details, or
refers to people or events that the reader will not learn about until
much later. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The writer's only responsibility is to
his art. He will be completely ruthless if he is a good one. He has a
dream. It anguishes him so much he must get rid of it. He has no peace
until then. Everything goes by the board: honor, pride, decency,
security, happiness, all, to get the book written. If a writer has to
rob his mother, he will not hesitate; the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" is
worth any number of old ladies." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Writers at Work: The Paris Review Interviews</font></i><font size="2">, 1959) </font></blockquote>

<p>William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, the oldest of
four sons of Murray Charles Faulkner and Maud (Butler) Faulkner. While
he was still a child, the family settled in Oxford in north-central
Mississippi. Faulkner lived most of his life in the town. While still
at school, he began to write poetry. At the Oxford High School he
played quarterback on football team and suffered a broken nose. Before
graduating, he dropped his studies and worked briefly in his
grandfather's bank. </p>
<p>After being rejected from the army because he was too short (5'
5''), Faulkner enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and had basic
training in Toronto. He served with the RAF in World War I, but did not
see any action. Before he could make his first solo flight, the war was
over. This did not stop him later telling that he was shot down in
France. </p><p>After the war he studied literature at the University
of Mississippi for a short time. He also wrote some poems and drew
cartoons for the university's humor magazine, <i>The Scream</i>. "I
liked the cartoons better than the poetry," recalled later George W.
Healy Jr., who edited the magazine. In 1920 Faulkner left the
university without taking a degree. Years later he wrote in a letter,
"what an amazing gift I had: uneducated in every formal sense, without
even very literate, let alone literary, companions, yet to have made
the things I made."</p>
<p>Faulkner moved to New York City, where he worked as a clerk in a
bookstore, and then returned to Oxford. For a time Faulkner supported
himself as a postmaster at the University of Mississippi, but was fired
for reading on the job. He drifted to New Orleans, where Sherwood
Anderson encouraged him to write fiction rather than poetry. </p>
<p>The early works of Faulkner bear witness to his reading of Keats,
Tennyson, Swinburne, and the fin-de-siècle English poetry. His first
book was <em>The Marble Faun</em> (1924), a collection of poems. It did not gain success. After a hiatus in Paris, he published <em>Soldier's Pay </em>(1926).
The novel centered on the return of a soldier, who has been physically
and psychologically disabled in WW I. It was followed by <em>Mosquitoes </em>, a satirical portrait of Bohemian life, artist and intellectuals, in New Orleans.</p>
<p>In 1929 Faulkner wrote <i>Sartoris</i>, the first of fifteen novels set in Yoknapatawpha County, a fictional region of Mississippi<font face="Symbol">-</font>actually Yoknapatawpha was Lafayette County. The Chickasaw Indian term meant "water passes slowly through flatlands."<i> Sartoris </i>was later reissued entitled <em>Flags in the Dust </em>(1973).
The Yoknapatawpha novels spanned the decades of economic decline from
the American Civil War through the Depression. Racism, class division,
family as both life force and curse, are the recurring themes along
with recurring characters and places. Faulkner used various writing
styles. The narrative varies from the traditional storytelling (<em>Light in August</em>) to series of snapshots (<em>As I Lay Dying</em>) or collage (<em>The Sound and the Fury</em>).<em>Go Down, Moses </em>(1942)
was a short story cycle about Yoknapatawpha blacks and includes one of
Faulkner's most frequently anthologized stories, 'The Bear', about a
ritual hunt, standing as a symbol of accepting traditional cultural
values. </p>
<p><em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is generally considered Faulkner's
masterpiece. It recods a range of voices and vocabularies, all trying
to unravel the mysteries of Thomas Sutpen's violent life. "Hemingway,"
Faulkner said once, "has never been known to use a word that might send
a reader to the dictionary." </p>
<p>In 1929 Faulkner married Estelle Oldham Franklin, his childhood
sweetheart, who had divorced his first husband, a lawyer. Next year he
purchased the traditional Southern pillared house in Oxford, which he
named Rowan Oak. Architecture was important for the author<font face="Symbol">-</font>he
obsessively restored his own house, named his books after buildings
('the mansion'), and depicted them carefully: "It was a big, squarish
frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires
and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies,
set on what had once been our most select street." <font size="2">(from 'A Rose for Emily') </font></p>
<p>With <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> (1929), his first masterwork,
Faulkner gained recognition as a writer. Its title originated from the
famous lines in Shakespeare's play <i>Macbeth</i>: "Life's but a
walking shadow, a poor player, / That struts and frets his hour upon
the stage, / And then is heard no more. It is a tale / Told by an
idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing." </p>
<p>While working at an electrical power station in a nightshift job, Faulkner wrote <i>As I Lay Dying</i>
(1930), about the illness, death, and burial of Addie Bundren. The book
consists of interior monologues, most of them spoken by members of the
Bundren family. The deceased herself has one monologue; her dying wish
is to be buried in her home town. Struggling through flood and fire the
family carries her coffin to the graveyard in Jefferson, Mississippi.
Ultimately, the journey becomes Addie's curse. "Now you are aware of
me! Now I am something in your secret and selfish life, who have marked
your blood with my own for ever and ever." Cash, Addie's son, breaks
his leg, Darl, another son, attempts to cremate his mother's body by
setting fire to the barn, and Dewey Dell is raped in the cellar of a
pharmacy. Addie is buried next to her father in the family plot. Darl's
sanity dies with her mother and he is taken finally to an asylum. Anse,
the father, appears with a woman, introducing her as the new 'Mrs
Bundren'.</p>
<p><em>Sanctuary</em> (1931), dedicated to Sherwood Anderson for
services rendered, was according to the author "deliberately conceived
to make money." In the story a young woman is raped by a murderer. She
finds sanctuary in a brothel, but none of the sexual acts there is
described in detail. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sanctuary</span>
was one of nine novel identified as obscene in the criminal proceedings
in the Court of Quarter sessions in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.
The other allegedly obscene novels were Harold Robbins's <span style="font-style: italic;">Never Love a Stranger</span>, James T. Farrell's <span style="font-style: italic;">Studs Lonigan Trilogy</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">A World I Never Made</span>, Erskine Caldwell's <span style="font-style: italic;">God Little Acre</span>, Calder Willingham's <span style="font-style: italic;">End as a Man</span>, and Faulkner's <span style="font-style: italic;">Wild Palms</span>. &nbsp;<br>
 </p>
<p>In 1933 Faulkner started to take flying lessons and he bought his
own plane. To earn money and support Estelle, their three children, and
some of the Oldhams, Faulker worked over the next 20 years in Hollywood
on several screenplays, from <i>Today We Live </i>(1933) to <i>Land of the Pharaos </i>(1955). His own stories were for the conservative producers too daring: they dealt with rape, incest, suicide etc. Moreover, Faulkner experimented with methods of narration, using page-long
sentences, and forcing the reader to hold in mind details and phrases
that are meaningful only at the end of the story. </p><p>Between scriptwriting Faulkner published several novel.&nbsp;<em>Pylon</em> (1934) was a story of four adults and a child, who travel from air show to another. <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>&nbsp;focused on Thomas Sutpen's attempts to found a Southern dynasty in the 19th-century Mississippi. <em>The Wild Palms </em>(1939) was a story of the Snopes family, in which the character McCord is based on <a href="HEMINGWA.HTM">Ernest Hemingway</a> and parallels <i>A Farwell to Arms</i>. <em>Go Down Moses, and Other Stories </em>(1942) contained 'The Bear,' one of his most celebrates pieces of short fiction. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He wrote</b></font><b><i><font size="2"> A Fable</font></i><font size="2">
in my house. He'd be typing away in the middle of the night. Worked
right on the typewriter, typed all night. I walked in on him, asked him
what he was working on there in the middle of the night. He said,
"Oh... on a novel." "Well... what's it about?" He said, "Oh, it's about
Jesus Christ coming to earth during the World War."</font></b><font size="2"> ( A.I. Bezzerides in </font><i><font size="2">The Big Book of Noir</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Ed Gorman, Lee Server and Martin H. Greenberg, 1998) </font></blockquote>

<p>By 1945, when Faulkner's novels were out of print, he moved again to Hollywood to
write under contract movie scripts, mostly for director <a href="hhawks.htm">Howard Hawks</a>. He had read Faulkner's 1926 novel <i>Soldier's Pay</i>
when it had just appeared and recommended it to his friends. In the
early 1930s Faulkner had written for the director an adaptation from
his short story 'Turn About'. Their first meeting ended in heavy
drinking, and started a long friendship. "Just a year apart in age,
with Hawks the senior, both were reserved to the point of
noncommunicativemess; Nunnally Johnson was astonished by the sight of
the two of them just sitting together not saying a word. When they did
talk, they did do slowly, in a drawling manner." <font size="2">(Todd McCarthy in <i>Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood</i>, 1997)</font> Faulkner cooperated with Hawks among others in the films <i>To Have and Have Not</i> (1944), based freely on <a href="hemingwa.htm">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s novel, and <i>The Big Sleep</i> (1946), based on <a href="rchandle.htm">Raymond Chandler</a>'s
novel. When Hemingway had turned down Hawk's offer to work with his own
book, the director had said, "I'll get Faulkner to do it; he can write
better than you can anyway." </p>
<p>Faulkner's second period of success started with the publication of <em>The Portable Faulkner</em>
(1946), which rescued him from near-oblivion. However, Faulkner's
physique and mental functioning was weakened by hard drinking. "When I
have one martini I feel bigger, wiser, taller," he confessed. "When I
have a second I feel superlative. After that there's no holding me."
Besides problems with alcohol his wife's drug addiction and declining
health shadowed his life. "I will always believe that my first
responsibility is to the artist, the work," he wrote in a letter; "it
is terrible that my wife does not realise or at least accept that."
Their daughter Jill later said that "Nothing about the marriage was
right." </p>
<p>Moreover, Hollywood was not the best refuge from domestic problems,
because Faulkner also had there series of affairs, among others with
Meta Carpenter Wilde, a script girl, who wrote a book about their
relationship. Faulkner did not hide his fear and contempt of the city:
"Sometimes I think if I do one more treatment or screenplay, I'll lose
whatever power I have as a writer," he told Carpenter. Faulkner
published in 1951 <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, and badly received magnum opus <em>A Fable </em>in 1954.<em>The Town </em>(1957) and <em>The Mansion </em>(1959) continued the story of the Snopes family, which he had begun in <em>The Hamlet</em> (1940). </p><p>With <em>The&nbsp;Reivers</em>&nbsp;(1962), set early in the 20th-century, Faulkner nostalgically revisited his childhood, and extends the world of <i>Sanctuary</i>. On June 17, 1962, he was thrown from a horse, and a few weeks later, on July 6, Faulkner died of a coronary occlusion. <i>The New York Times</i> cited his critics in his obituary <i></i>and
stated that "Mr. Faulkner's writings showed an obsession with murder,
rape, incest, suicide, greed and general depravity that did not exist
anywhere but in the author's mind". <font size="2">(July 7, 1962)</font> Fourty-three years later, in his review of Jay Parini's book<i> One Matchless Time: A Life of William Faulkner</i>
(2004) the Nobel writer J.M. Coetzee defined Faulkner not only as "the
most radical innovator in the annals of American fiction," but "a
writer to whom the avant-garde of Europe and Latin America would go to
school."<font size="2"> (<i>The New York Review of Books</i>, April 7, 2005) </font></p>
