      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Russian-born American novelist,
critic,
and acknowledged lepidopterist. Nabokov wrote both in Russian and
English. His best-known novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lolita
      </span>(1955), shocked many people but its humor and literary
style were praised by critics. The first version of the story, <span style="font-style: italic;">Volshebnik</span> (The Enchanter), was
written in 1939 in Paris. <i>The Enchanter</i> centered on a
middle-aged man, who falls in love with a 12-year-old girl and marries
her sick, widowed mother to satisfy his erotic desires. He molests the
girl in a Riviera hotel while she's asleep, she wakens and he runs into
the traffic and dies. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Between the age limits of nine and
fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice
or many times older than they, reveal their nature, which is not human,
but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose
designate as "nymphets." </b>(from <i>Lolita</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Vladimir Nabokov was born in St. Petersburg into a wealthy,
aristocratic family. His father, Vladimir
Dimitrievich Nabokov, was a liberal politician, lawyer, and journalist.
The household was Anglophile &#8211; Nabokov spoke Russian and English, and
at the age of five he learned French. <br>
</p>
      <p>Nabokov received his education at
the Tenishev, St. Petersburg's most innovative school. At 16 he
inherited a large estate from his father's brother, but he did not have
much time to enjoy his wealth. During the Russian Revolution his father
was briefly arrested. The family emigrated to Berlin and Nabokov
entered Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1923.
Vladimir
Dimitrievich was murdered in Berlin in 1922 by a Russian monarchist. </p>

      <p>Nabokov spent 15 years in Berlin, where he worked as a
translator,
tutor, and tennis coach. From 1932-37 he lived with his wife and son at
Nestorstrasse 22 in Wilmersdorf. He won acceptance as the leading young
writer
in the Russian community. Berlin was for him a city " "swarming with
ragamuffins", as he said in the short novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Otchayanie</span> (1936; Despair, 1937).
Most of his readers were Russian émigrés &#8211; in the Soviet Russia his
books were banned or ignored. In his early works Nabokov dealt with the
death, the flow of time and sense of loss. Already using
complex metaphors, his themes became later more ambiguous puzzles
&#8211; he was a remarkable chess player &#8211; that challenge the reader to
involve in the game. ''Readers are not sheep," he once wrote to a
publisher, "and not every pen (pun) tempts them." In <span style="font-style: italic;">Lectures on Literature</span> (1980)
Nabokov wrote that to be a good reader one does not have to lean heavily
on emotional identification, action, and the social-economic or
historical angle, or belong to a book club. "The good reader is one who
has imagination, memory, a dictionary, and some artistic sense &#8211; which
sense I propose to develop in myself and in others whenever I have the
chance."</p>
      <p>In <i>Zashchita Luzhina</i><i> </i>(1930, The Defense)
Nabokov took the role of a grandmaster and played with the expectations
of his readers. The protagonist, Aleksandr Luzhin, is a
chess phenomenon, who becomes a character on a giant chessboard. Luzhin
finds it increasingly difficult to make the transition from
the world of the game to everyday reality. After suffering a mental
breakdown, he recuperates slowly with the help of a young woman. Luzhin
starts to believe that a cunning opponent is
trying to manipulate the moves he makes in his life. He
decides to throw himself out of a window and notices that the courtyard
below seems to look like a giant chessboard. Luzhin is right: there is
an opponent and he is Nabokov himself, who makes the point that the
story is an artistic creation.</p>
      <p>As a writer Nabokov gained his first literary success with his
translations of some of Heine's songs. Nabokov's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mashenka</span> (1926), was written in
Russia. In 1924 Nabokov married Véra
Evseevna Slonim, who came from a Jewish family; they had one son,
Dmitri. Nabokov's early nine novels were published under the pen name
Vladimir Sirin. These works included <i> The Gift</i> (1937-38), a
novel and an intellectual history of 19th-century Russia, and<i>
Invitation to a Beheading</i> (1938), a political fantasy, in which the
remaining days in the life the central character correspond to the
length of his pencil. Nabokov himself wrote everything in
longhand. "I cannot type," he confessed in an interview in 1962. </p>
      <p>When Hitler released the killer of his father, Nabokov moved
to
Paris in 1937. There he met the Irish novelist James Joyce. With a loan
he received from the composer Rachmaninov, Nabokov moved three years
later with his wife and son to the United
States &#8211; he crossed the ocean on the <i>Champlain</i>, where he had a
first-class cabin.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>
      <p>Nabokov taught at Wellesley College and Cornell University,
delivering highly acclaimed lectures on Flaubert, Joyce, Turgenev,
Tolstoy, and others. Among his major
critical works are his study of Nikolay Gogol (1944), and translation
of Aleksandr Pushkin's masterpiece <i>Eugene Onegin</i>
(1964), with
commentary. The ten-year-long work was first brought out by Bollingen
Foundation in four volumes. Nabokov cautioned against translating rhyme
by rhyme: "Can a rhymed poem like <span style="font-style: italic;">Eugene Onegin</span>
be truly translated with a retention of its rhymes. The answer is, of
course, no. To reproduce the rhymes and yet translate the entire poem
literally is mathematically impossible." </p>
      <p>In the United States Nabokov continued his extensive
researches in
entomology, becoming a recognized authority on butterflies. He also
held a modest but official position at the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard University. The job lasted until 1948. As a
lepidopterist he was self-taught, but his attitude to scientific work
was serious, not dilettantish. Especially he was interested in Blues,
the tribe Polyommatini, found all over the world. Later Nabokov
estimated that between the years 1949 and 1959 he traveled more than
150,000 miles on butterfly trips. His years at the museum Nabokov
described as "the most delightful and thrilling in all my adult life." In
his boyhood Nabokov had already made notes on butterflies and in 1920<i>
The Entomologist</i> had published his article 'A Few Notes on Crimean
Lepidoptera'. "My pleasures are the most intense known to man: writing
and butterfly hunting," Nabokov once said. Nabokov's first publication
in English was an article titled 'A Few Notes on Crimean Lepidoptera'.
Changing languages was not easy &#8211; ''What agony it was, in the early
'forties, to switch from Russian to English,'' he wrote in a letter in
1954. </p>

      <p>Nabokov's first novels in English were<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</span>
(1941) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bend Sinister</span>
(1947). The <i>Atlantic</i> and the <i>New Yorker</i> started to
publish Nabokov's short stories in the early 1940s. In America, apart
from collecting his shorter prose of the 1930s into one book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Vesna v Fial'te</span>, Nabokov published
only memoirs and verse in Russian. <span style="font-style: italic;">Conclusive
Evidence</span> (1951) was an
autobiography, which was later revived as <span style="font-style: italic;">Speak, Memory</span> (1966), set mainly in
pre-revolutionary Russia. When the Australian critic and writer Andrew
Field planned to write a biography on Nabokov, the answer was: "I told
everything about myself in <i>Speak, Memory</i>, and it was not a very
pleasant portrait. I appear as a precious person in that book. All that
chess and those butterflies. Not very interesting." </p>
      <p>It took six years before Nabokov finished <i>Lolita</i>, a
literary bomb. The English writer Graham Greene cited it among the best
books of 1955. Edmund Wilson, Evelyn Waugh, and E.M. Forster did not
share his view. With <i>Lolita</i> Nabokov gained a huge success,
although it was banned in Paris in 1956-58 and not published in full in
America and the U.K. until 1958. </p>
      <p> <i>Lolita</i> is one of the most controversial novels of the
20th-century, in which the rhetoric of the protagonist both captivates
and repels. The story deals with the desire of a middle-aged pedophile
Humbert Humbert, the narrator, for a 12-year-old girl. "Lolita, light
of my life, fire of my loins," he starts his story. Humbert is said to
be a metaphor for the writer and his art, and for the old world &#8211;
Humbert is an European expatriate &#8211; encountering the new, represented
by an American teenage girl, in all its vulgarity. Humbert keeps a
prison-diary of his lifelong fascination with pubescent "nymphets". The
first is Annabel Leigh, who dies of typhus, but then he finds Dolores
Haze, his Lolita, in a New England town. She reminds him of the little
girl he loved as a boy. During the course of the story, Humbert loses
her to Clare Quilty, a playwright and pornographic filmmaker. Humbert
kills him and dies in a prison of a heart attack. Lolita dies in
childbirth as delivering a stillborn daughter. </p>
      <p>Stanley Kubrick's film version of the book was based on
Nabokov's screenplay. "I knew that if I did not write the script
somebody else would," Nabokov said, "and I also knew that at best the
end product is such cases is less of a blend than a collision of
interpretations." </p>
      <p><i>Lolita </i>allowed Nabokov to abandon teaching and devote
himself entirely to writing. In 1957 Nabokov published<span style="font-style: italic;"> Pnin</span>, a story of a hapless Russian
professor of literature on an American college campus. <span style="font-style: italic;">Pale Fire</span> (1962) was an ambitious
mixture of literary forms, partly a one-thousand-line poem in heroic
couplets by John Shade, partly a commentary on them by a mad exiled
king, Kinbote. "I can do what only a true artist can do," describes the
mad Kinbote himself, "pounce upon the forgotten butterfly or
revelation, wean myself abruptly from the habit of things..."</p>
      <p>From 1959 Nabokov lived in Switzerland, where his permanent
home was at the Montreux Palace Hotel. He continued to collect
butterflies, which after his death were stored at the Cantonal Museum
of Zoology of Lausanne. Nabokov's later works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Ada</span> (1969), a love story
set on the planet of Antiterra, a mixture of
Russia and America, <span style="font-style: italic;">Transparent
Things</span> (1972), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Look at
the Harlequins!</span> (1975), in which Nabokov's own life coincides
occasionally with the protagonist's, also a writer. </p>
      <p>The writer's son Dmitri has undertook the translation of
several of Nabokov's books from these later years. Nabokov himself
wanted to be valued more as an American writer than a Russian one. In
the Soviet Union he perhaps enjoyed greater fame than in the West.
Nabokov died in Lausanne on July 2, 1977.&nbsp; </p>
