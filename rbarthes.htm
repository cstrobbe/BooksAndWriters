<p>French social and literary critic, whose writings on semiotics made
structuralism one of the leading intellectual movements of the 20th
century. In his lifetime Barthes published seventeen books and numerous
articles, many of which were gathered to form collections. His ideas
have offered alternatives to the methods of traditional literary
scholarship. Barthes' writings have had a considerable following among
students and teachers both in and outside France. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>The writer's language is not expected to
represent reality, but to signify it. This should impose on critics the
duty of using two rigorously distinct methods: one must deal with the
writer's realism either as an ideological substance (Marxist themes in
Brecht's work, for instance) or as a semiological value (the props, the
actors, the music, the colours in Brechtian dramaturgy). The ideal
of-course would be to combine these two types of criticism; the mistake
which is constantly made is to confuse them: ideology has its methods,
and so has semiology. </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Mythologies</font></i><font size="2">, 1957) </font></blockquote>
<p>Roland Barthes was born in Cherbough, Manche. After his father's
death in a naval battle in 1916, Barthes' mother Henriette Binger
Barthes moved to Bayonne, where Barthes spent his childhood. In 1924
she moved with her son to Paris, where Barthes attended the Lycée
Montaigne (1924-30) and Lycée Louis-le-Grand (1930-34). "Not an unhappy
youth," Barthes later recalled, "thanks to the affection which
surrounded me, but an awkward one, because of the solitude and material
constraint." In 1927 Henriette gave birth to an illegitimate child,
Michel Salzado, Barthes' half-brother. When Barthes' grandparents
refused to give her financial help, she supported her family as a
bookbinder. At the Sorbonne Barthes studied classical literature, Greek
tragedy, grammar and philology, receiving degrees in classical
literature (1939) and grammar and philology (1943). </p>
<p>In 1934 Barthes contracted tuberculosis and spent the years 1934-35 and 1942-46 in sanatoriums. 
During the Occupation he was in a sanatorium in the Isère. Numerous relapses with tuberculosis 
prevented 
him from carrying out his doctoral research, but he read avidly 
("What else did you have to do except read?"), started to do a little writing, founded a theatrical troupe, 
the Groupe Théâtral Antique, 
and cofounded the magazine <i>Théâtre populaire</i>. While  
in the mountain village of Touvet, he wrote an article, 'Notes sur André Gide et son Journal', 
which was published in 1942 in <i>Existences</i>,
the student magazine of the Sanatorium des Estudiants de France at
Saint-Hilaire-du-Touvet, saying in the opening of the notes that
"incoherence seemst to me prefetable to a distorting order". Barthes
was a teacher at lycées in Biarritz (1939), Bayonne (1939-40), Paris
(1942-46), at the French Institute in Bucharest, Romania (1948-49),
University of Alexandria, Egypt (1949-50), and Direction Générale des
Affaires Culturelles (1950-52). In 1952-59 he had research appointments
with Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, from 1960 to 1976 he
was a director of studies at École Pratique des Hautes Études. In
1967-68 he taught at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and from
1976 to 1980, he was the chair of literary semiology at Collège de
France.</p>
<p>Barthes entered the French intellectual scene in the 1950s. The work which brought him into modern literature 
was <a href="sartre.htm">Sartre</a>'s <i>What is Literature?</i> (1947). <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Degré zéro de l'écriture</span> (1953, Writing Degree Zero) was initially published as articles in <a href="acamus.htm">Albert Camus</a>' journal, <i>Combat</i>. It established Barthes as one of leading critics of Modernist literature in France. It introduced the concept of <i>écriture</i>
("scription") as distinguished from style, language, and writing. The
work connected him closely with the writers of nouveau roman. He was
the first critic to identify the goals of the writings of Alain
Robbe-Grillet and Michel Butor. Barthes looked at the historical
conditions of literary language and posed the difficulty of a modern
practice of writing: committed to language the writer is at once caught
up in particular discursive orders. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Michelet par lui-même</span> (1954), a biography of Jules Michelet,&nbsp; focused on&nbsp; the personal obsessions of the 19th-century historian. Barthes
saw that they are part of his writing, and give existential reality to
the historical moments related by the historian's writing. The
impressionistic <span style="font-style: italic;">Mythologies</span>
(1957) drew on semiological concepts in the analysis of myths and signs
in contemporary culture. Barthes used as his material newspapers,
films, shows and exhibitions, mainly due to their connection to
ideological discourse. The starting point was not in the traditional
value judgements and investigation of the author's intentions, but in
the text itself as a system of signs, whose underlying structure forms
the "meaning of the work as a whole" An advertising firm found Barthes'
works so compelling that it persuaded him to work briefly as a
consultant for the auto manufacturer Renault. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sur Racine</span> (1963), three impressionistc essays on the dramatist, caused some controversy because of its 
nonscholarly point of view and neologisms. 
Raymond Picard, a Sorbonne professor and Racine scholar, criticized in his <i>Nouvelle critique ou nouvelle imposture?</i> 
(1965) the subjective nature of Barthes' essays. Barthes answered in <span style="font-style: italic;">Critique et Vérité</span> (1966), which postulated 
a "science of criticism" to replace the "university criticism" perpetuated by Picard and his colleagues. 
Barthes recommended that criticism become a science and showed that critical terms and approaches are connected to dominant 
class-ideology. The values of clarity, nobility, and humanity, taken as a self-evident basis for a research, are a censoring 
force on other kinds of approach. Thus Barthes dismissed such stylists as Flaubert and Gide and praised Sartre &#8211; it was 
"never said that he wrote well." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>I speak in the name of what? Of a function? A body of knowledge? An experience? What do I 
represent? A scientific capacity? An institution? A service? In fact, I speak only in the name of language: I speak because 
I have written; writing is represented by its contrary, by speech... For writing can tell the truth on language but not the 
truth on the real...</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Image-Music-Text</font></i><font size="2">, 1977) </font></blockquote>
<p>During his career, Barthes published more essays than substantial studies, presenting his views among others in subjective 
aphorism and not in the form of theoretical postulates. In<span style="font-style: italic;"> Le Plaisir du texte</span> (1973) Barthes developed further his ideas of the 
personal dimensions in relationship with the text. Barthes analyzed his desire to read along with his likes, dislikes, and 
motivations associated with that activity.<span style="font-style: italic;"> L'Empire des signes</span> (1970) was written after Barthes's visit to Japan, and dealt 
with the country's myths. In this great introduction to the art of definitions, Japanese cooking was for him "the 
twilight of the raw", a haiku a "vision without commentary", and sex "is everywhere, except in 
sexuality." </p>
<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Eléments de sémiologie</span> (1964) Barthes systematized his views on the "science of signs", 
based on Ferdinand de Saussure's (1857-1913) concept of language and analysis of myth and ritual. Barthes made his 
most intensive application of structural linguistics in <span style="font-style: italic;">S/Z</span>
(1970). By analyzing phase-by-phase Balzac's short story 'Sarrasine',
he dealt with the experience of reading, the relations of the reader as
subject to the movement of language in texts. According to Barthes,
classic criticism has never paid any attention to the reader. But the
reader is the space, in which all the multiple aspects of the text
meet. A text's unity lies not in its origin but in its destination.
"... the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the
Author." The study has become the focal point and model for multilevel
&#8211; nearly playful &#8211; literary criticism because of its analytical
concentration on the structural elements that constitute the literary
whole. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>One day, quite some time ago, I happened
on a photograph of Napoleon's youngest brother, Jerome, taken in 1852.
And I realized then, with an amazement I have not been able to lessen
since: "I am looking at eyes that looked at the Emperor."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Camera Lucinda</font></i><font size="2">, 1980) </font></blockquote>
<p>As a gesture of solidarity Barthes travelled in 1974 to China with Philippe Sollers, Julia Kristeva, François Wahl, 
and other writers. His 
notes on the journey, <span style="font-style: italic;">Carnets de voyage en Chine</span>, in which he expressed his boredom and disappointment with 
Chairman Mao's China, were published in 2009. 
Barthes' final book was<span style="font-style: italic;"> La Chambre claire</span> (1980, Camera Lucida), in which photography is discussed as a 
communicating medium. It was written in the short space between his mother's death and his own. 
The author himself confesses that he is too impatient to be a photographer, but whenever he poses in 
front of the lens, his "body never finds its zero degree, no one can give it to me (perhaps only 
my mother? For it is not indifference which erases the weight of the image &#8211; the Photomat always turns you 
into a criminal type, wanted by the police &#8211; but love, extreme love)." Photography, especially 
portraits, was for him "a magic, not an art." Through his life Barthes lived with or near his 
mother, who died in 1977, at the age of 84. During her illness Barthes nursed her, and later wrote in<i> Camera Lucida</i>,
that "ultimately I experienced her, strong as she had been, my inner
law, as my feminine child... Once she was dead I no longer had any
reason to attune myself to the progress of the superior Life Force (the
race, the species)." A day after the death of his mother, Barthes began
to keep a diary, which was published in 2009 under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Journal de deuil</span> (Mourning Diary).  

Barthes died three years later in Paris as the result of a street accident on 
March 23, 1980. While walking home from a lunch  given by François Mitterrand, he hit by a laundry van. 

Posthumously published <span style="font-style: italic;">Incidents</span> (1987) revealed the author's homosexuality.</p>
