      <p>French playwright and adventurer, whose best known comedies
are <i>The Barber of Seville </i>(1775) and <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>
(1784). The plays inspired two famous operas, the first composed by
Gioachhino Rossini, and the second by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Beaumarchais was one of the most colorful characters of the old Regime,
who earned and lost fortunes, served as a secret agent in Britain, and
supplied guns to the American revolutionaries. Although he supported
the French Revolution, he was forced to go into exile. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"No, Monsieur le Comte, you shan't
have her! You shan't have her. Because you are a great noble, you think
you are a great genius! Nobility, a fortune, a rank, appointments to
office: all this makes a man so proud! What did you do to earn all
this? You took the trouble to get born - nothing more. Moreover, you're
really a pretty ordinary fellow. While as for me, lost in the crowd,
I've had to use more knowledge, more brains, just to keep alive than
your likes have to spend on governing Spain and the Empire for a
century. And you want to contest with me - ..."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Marriage of Figaro</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Pierre de Beaumarchais was born Pierre Augustin Caron in
Paris, one of ten children by André-Charles Caron, a watchemaker, and
the former Louise-Nicole Pichon. In his childhood he learned to play
violin, flute and harp. He attended a trade school in Alfortville,
where he learned some Latin, and then worked as a clockmaker in his
father's shop. He had fine fine fingers and good manual dexterity, which was a requirement for working with very small watches. <br>
</p>
      <p>After many legal actions, Beaumarchais earned in 1754 a patent
from the French Academy of Sciences for his invention, a new form of
escapement mechanism, which became a standard part of new improved
watches. In 1756 Beaumarchais married Madeleine Francquet, a widow and
a wealthy customer of his father's shop. Francquel, like her husband,
was a gifted harpist. She encouraged him to redesign the pedals; this
arrangement remains in use on harps today. Francquel died from typhoid
fever in 1757 and left
him a small property, from which he took the name Beaumarchais. <br>
      </p>

      <p>A crucial but necessary step in Beaumarchais's life was when
he presented himself at court in 1754. After selling a watch to Mme de
Pompadour, he gained
the attention of the King. For a period, he had a post in Versailles as
a music teacher to the daughters of Louis XV, but soon plunged into a
series of political and financial intrigues, adventures &#8211; and lawsuits.
In one case he believed that his opponent had won the courts by bribing
the judge more generously than he himself had. The financier and
adviser to Mme Pompadour, Joseph Paris-Duverney sent him to missions to
England and Spain to secure a monopoly of the slave trade. Although he
did not gain success, due to his contact with Duverney and business
skills he managed to make a fortune and buy the post of King's
Secretary. In 1768 he married another wealthy widow,
Geneviève-Madeleine Wettebled Lévêque. She also died after a short
marriage, in 1770. His third wife was Marie-Thérèse Willermanulas, whom
he married in 1786. </p>
      <p>In 1776 , after the remnants of George Washington's American
army had crossed the Delaware into Pennsylvania in 1776, and British troops
prepared to seize the rebel capital of Philadelphia, Beaumarchais wrote
to French foreign minister Vergennes: "The Americans will triump, but
they must be assisted in their struggle. We must . . . send secret
assistance in a prudent manner to the Americans." France joined the
American War of Independence against Britain officially in 1778, but
Beaumarchais had already supplied arms to the American colonies. He
also organized a fleet of merchant ships to carry cannons, ammunition
and other equipment and assist the Continental Congress. In exchange
for the war supplies the agent of Congress promised to send back
produce, chiefly tobacco, as compensation of the debt. 40 years later
Beaumarchais's daughter still waited for the compensation, which was
about 2 million francs. Congress replied: "Take one third or nothing." </p>
      <p>When the French writer Charles Théveneau de Morande threatened
to publish in London a biography of the King's mistress, Mme du Barry,
the King sent Beaumarchais to purchase the manuscript. Groundwork for
the negotiations had been made by <a href="deon.htm">Chevalier d'Eon</a>,
who was living at that time in exile in England. D'Eon was a diplomat,
spy, and a member of the elite Dragoons. Later Beaumarchais also
negotiated with d'Eon over the latter's political rehabilitation. At
that time rumors were spreading that Monsieur d'Eon was a woman, and in
London Beaumarchais laid a wager on his sex. D'Eon expressed his
disgust on Beaumarchais's attitude toward women, writing to him: "Why,
during your last trip to London, did you contract a venereal disease,
which was probably given to everyone in Paris; while, in order to amuse
yourself certainly at my expense, or to make me look ridiculous, you
let it be known in circles of your elegant women that you were supposed
to marry me after I spent several months in the Abbaye des Dames de
Sainte-Antoine?" Beaumarchais defended himself:. "I noted your
announcement in the newspaper, whose goal, according to you, was to
discourage bets on your sex, was so strangely worded as to seem written
solely to stimulate such speculations and thus so contrary to the
ostentatious disinterestedness that you affect..." <font size="2">(from
      </font><i><font size="2">Monsierur d'Eon is a Woman</font></i><font size="2"> by Gary Kates, 1995) </font> </p>
      <p>In 1777, Beaumarchais founded one of the first organizations
to protect authors' rights, La Société des Auterus Dramatiques. After
Voltaire's death Beaumarchais bought his banned books. To publish them,
he opened a printing shop in Kehl, out of the reach of the French
censors, and brought out the first complete edition of Voltaire
(1784-90). This 70-volume edition was a financial disaster. </p>
      <p>Beaumarchais supported the French Revolution but his position
at the royal court threw suspicion on him. In 1792 he lost money in
attempting to sell muskets to the revolutionary armies; he also spent
some time in the Abbaye Prison. After release, Beaumarchais fled
through England and Holland to Hamburg. His property in Paris was
confiscated and his family imprisoned. In 1796 he returned to France.
Beaumarchais died of a stroke in Paris on May 18, 1799 in relative
poverty. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>THE COUNT: I do believe it's that
rascal Figaro. </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">FIGARO: Himself. My Lord! </font><br>
        <font size="2">THE COUNT: Miserable scoundrel! If you utter a
single word... </font><br>
        <font size="2">FIGARO: Yes, I recognize you - and the familiar
epithets you always condescended to bestow upon me. </font><br>
        <font size="2">THE COUNT: I shouldn't have recognized you. You
are so fat and sleek...</font><br>
        <font size="2">FIGARO: Well, what do you expect, Sir - it's
poverty. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Barber of
Seville) </font></i></blockquote>
      <p>Beaumarchais's early plays were performed privately at the
salon of his friend, Charles Lenormand d'Étoiles, husband of Mme de
Pompadour. The full-length drama <i>Eugénie</i>
(1767), produced by
Comédie-Française, was about false marriage promises, and the shame of
women who are deceived by members of the nobility. Too controversial
for the audience, the play was closed the same night it was opened. One
critic said that the writer "will never achieve anything, not even
mediocrity." The story was set in
London, but based on the experiences of Beaumarchais's sister. She had
followed a penniless Spanish grandee to Spain, where he broke the
engagement. Also <a href="goethe.htm">Goethe</a>'s melodrama <i>Clavigo</i>
was partly based on this contemporary scandal. <i>Mémoires </i>(1773-1774)
was born from complicated lawsuits. Beaumarchais had sued the heir of
Paris-Duverney for the money the estate owed him, but lost the suit.
However, he won a small victory when the polemic work about the unfair
decision against him brought the public opinion to his side. </p>
      <p><i>The Barber of Seville </i>and <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>
showed Beaumarchais sympathy for the lot of the under-privileged people
and the lower classes. In both plays the hero is a valet, Figaro, who
is more clever than his noble employers, especially his master
Almavira. In these class-conscious plays Beaumarchais mocked
aristocracy although he was well-aware of his dependance on its favour.
This also created a constant tension in his dramas &#8211; much is said and
much is written between the lines. <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> was
written in 1775-78, but it was not until 1783 when it received the
king's permission for a stage production. "If censorship reigns there
cannot be sincere flattery, and only small men are afraid of small
writings," Beaumarchais taunted. In his famous monologue Figaro
condemned his aristocratic employer and tormentor, forecasting with his
protest the coming revolution. Figaro has become one of the most famous
French fictional characters, who has epitomized a number of
characteristics that the Frenchmen see in themselves. </p>
      <p>Mozart's opera version of the play was based on the libretto
written by Lorenzo da Ponte. It gained a huge popularity. "Here they
talk about nothing but <i>Figaro</i>. Nothing is played, sung or
whistled but <i>Figaro</i>," wrote Mozart to a friend from Prague.
Paisiello's opera on Beaumarchais's <i>The Barber of Seville </i>had
become popular before Rossini introduced his own work. The audience
reacted first hostile to the new version, performed in 1816, but soon
all resistance was swept away. Beaumarhais wrote also an opera
libretto, <i>Tarare</i> (1787), which was set to music by Antonio
Salieri and performed at the Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique. </p>
