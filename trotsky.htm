      <p>Russian Jewish Revolutionary leader and Soviet politician, a
close friend of Lenin. Trotsky's theory of "permanent revolution"
became unpopular after Stalin had gained power in the Soviet Union.
Trotsky was assassinated by one of Stalin's agents. Although Trotsky
later condemned the Red Terror, he was, perhaps, one of its first
proponents. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Things are not going well. The
Greek soldiers landed on the shores of Crimea, according to the reports
of Allied diplomats and newspapermen, were mounted on Crimean donkeys,
but the donkeys were not able to arrive in time at the Perekop Isthmus.
Things are not going well. Evidently even donkeys have begun to shake
off the imperialistic harness."</b> (from Trotsky's speech on April
1919) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Lev Davidovich Bronstein (Leon Trotsky) was born in Yanovka,
Ukraine, the son of an illiterate Jewish farmer. Trotsky's father,
David Bronshtein, had bought land near the small town of Bobrinets, and
eventually he became a substantial landowner. During the revolution he
lost his estate, but Trotsky set him up as the manager of a flour mill
near Moscow. Trotsky's mother, Anna, came from Odessa, where she had
received a modest education. "We were not deprived, except of life's
generosity and tenderness", Trotsky later said. His mother loved to
read to her eight children and encouraged them to acquire a good
education. She died in 1910. Only Lev, two sisters and a brother
survived beyond childhood. After Trotsky was deported in 1929, his
brother Alexander publicly disowned him, but he was shot in 1938. Liza,
Trotsky's elder sister, died in 1924. Trotsky's younger sister Olga
married an influential Bolshevik leader, Lev Kamenev, but she was shot
in 1941. Her two young sons were shot in 1936. </p>
      <p>After attending a Jewish primary school, Trotsky studied at a
state school in Odessa. He was a very good student, who especially
loved mathematics, but was expelled for a year when he fell foul of the
French teacher. "I can hardly think of a single teacher whom I might
remember with affection", he recalled. </p>
      <p>Trotsky joined in 1896 the Social Democrats. Two years later
he was arrested as a Marxist and exiled to Siberia. During this period
Trostky occupied himself with Freemasonry, which he studied in prison.
In 1902 he escaped and reached England. With him he carried a passport
that used the name of a jailer in Odessa's prison, Trotsky. </p>
      <p>In London Trotsky met Lenin and other Russian Revolutionary
thinkers and collaborated in publication their journal of <i>Iskra </i>(The
Spark). When the party split in 1903, and Trotsky broke with Lenin, he
gained position as a leader of the Menshevik wing of the Social
Democratic party, as opposed to the Bolshevik one under Lenin,
prophesying that Leninist theory would result in a one-man
dictatorship. In the abortive 1905 revolution Trotsky organized the
first revolutionary Soviet council in St. Petersburg and was appointed
president of the Soviet. About this time he propounded the doctrine of
permanent revolution, which implied that revolution in one country must
be followed by revolutions in other countries, eventually throughout
the world. After the uprising ended he was again exiled to Siberia, and
managed once more escape. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Some time before the war the
Austro-Hungarian government received a sharp note from St Petersburg,
demanding that a stop be put to the activities of the Russian political
emigrants in Vienna. The Minister of the Interior received the note and
shook with laughter: 'Who do they think is going to start a revolution
in Russia - perhaps that Herr Trotsky from the Café Central?'" </b>(from
        </font><i><font size="2">Wit as a Weapon </font></i><font size="2">by Egon Larsen, 1980) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Trotsky worked then as journalist in Vienna, and become editor
of <i>Pravda</i> (truth). With the outbreak of World War I he moved to
Zürich in 1914 and then to Germany, where he was imprisoned for
opposing the war. During World War I Trotsky led the internationalist
wing of the Mensheviks. He denounced Russia's involvement in the war.
In 1915 Trotsky moved to Paris, editing the socialist weekly <i>Nashe
Slovo</i>, but he was expelled from France as a result of his pacifist
propaganda. After a short stay in New York as the editor of <i>Novy
Mir, </i>and finding out that some Wall Street bankers were willing to
finance a revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia in 1917. He joined the
Bosheviks in St. Petersburg and established the magazine <i>Vperied </i>(Forward).
Trotsky was arrested for a short time by Aleksandr Feodorovich
Kerenski's provisional government, but after release he played a major
role in the October Revolution.</p>
      <p>At the conference in Brest-Litovsk in 1918 Trotsky was leader
of the Russian delegate. From 1919 to 1927 he was a member of
Politburo. Trotsky was made the Russian Civil War commissar for war
(1918-25) and created in this post the Red army. For two and half
years, as he explained in <i>My Life</i>, he lived in his heavy
armored train with two engines, travelling from one front to another.
The Red army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000, and fought on sixteen
fronts simultaneously. With his speeches Trotsky encouraged villagers,
troops, his illiterate audience who was cut off from the vital news.
"These spring months become the decisive months in the history of
Europe. At the same time this spring will decide definitely the fate of
the bourgeois and rich peasant, anti-Soviet Russia." </p>
      <p>In 1921-22 the last remnants of non-Communist socialist
parties, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, were abolished.
In May 1922 Lenin suffered a stroke which left him partly paralyzed, in
early 1923 another took away his speech and in January 1924 he died.
After Lenin's death, among the aspiring successors, Stalin and Trotsky
were the leading figures. In his writings Trotsky stressed the
peculiarities of the Russian economic and social development. "The
insignificance of the Russian cities, which more than anything else
promoted the development of an Asian state, also made impossible a
Reformation - that is, a replacement of the feudal-bureaucratic
orthodoxy by some sort of modernized kind of Christianity adapted to
the demands of a bourgeois society. The struggle against the state
church did not go farther than the creation of peasant sects, the
faction of the Old Believers being the most powerful among them." (from
      <i>The History of the Russian Revolution</i>, 1931-33) Russia,
lacking the mature capitalist development, could go straight to a
dictatorship of the proletariat, but Trotsky believed that it was
impossible to build socialism in one country alone. In this he
disagreed fatally with Stalin. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The dictatorship of the Communist
Party is maintained by recourse to every form of violence." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Terrorism and Communism</font></i><font size="2">, 1924) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Although Lenin had rejected Stalin as his successor, Stalin
strengthened his position. He inclined towards concentrating on the
development of a Communist order in Russia, while Trotsky was dedicated
to the belief that Russia should catalyze worldwide Communist
revolution. Stalin believed that socialism in one country was possible.
A schism broke out in Communist ranks. Trotsky's Left Opposition tried
to mobilize the Moscow proletariat, but this failed due to the workers'
indifference. The failure proved that he was no longer a charismatic
mass leader. Trotsky's influence began to decline and Stalin removed
him from the commissariat for war. </p>
      <p>From 1925 to 1926 Trotsky held relatively minor administrative
post, before he was ousted from the party by Stalin. In 1927 Trotsky
was exiled to Alma Ata, in Kazakstan, where he devoted himself to
writing his memoirs and bitter pamphlets. The 'combined opposition' of
Trotsky, Grigory Zinoview, and Lev Kamenev was unsuccessful. In 1929
Trotsky was totally expelled from the Soviet Union. With this stroke
Stalin became the sole and undisputable leader of the Communist Party,
and therefore of the Soviet Union. </p>
      <p>During the following years Trotsky lived in Turkey (1929-33),
France (1933-35), Norway (1935-36), and finally found asylum in Mexico,
where he was invited by the socialist artist Diego Rivera (1886-1957).
With Frida Kahlo, Rivera's wife, he had a brief affair. She gave him a
self-portrait, 'Between the Courtains' (1937), when the relationship
finished. The French surrealist André Breton, who saw the painting in
Trotsky's study, said that "we are privileged to be present, as in the
most glorious days of German romanticims, at the entry of a young woman
endowed with all the gifts of seduction." </p>
      <p>On the death of his elder son Lev Sedov in 1934, Trotsky
wrote: "Yagoda [head of the security organs] caused the premature death
of one of my daughters, and drove the other to suicide. He arrested my
two sons-in-law who simply disappeared without a trace. The GPU
arrested my younger son, Sergei... and he then disappeared." In Mexico
Trotsky continued his attack on Stalin's leadership and the
'degeneration' of the political system in the Soviet Union. Trotsky
regarded the dictatorship he and Lenin had established as justified
because it was exercised in the interest of the proletariat, and so it
was quite different from Stalin's dictatorship, because the latter
acted only in its own interests. In the United States Trotskyism
enjoyed support of influential critics and intellectuals, some of whom
were associated with the literary and political journal the <i>Partisan
Review</i>. </p>
      <p>Trotsky's <i>Literature and Revolution</i> (1924), a
collection of articles, was his most important contribution to
literature criticism. He had sympathy for Russian Futurism and praises <a href="majakovs.htm">Mayakovsky</a> for placing his art at the service
of the Revolution. According to Trotsky, "art, it is said, is not a
mirror, but a hammer: it does not reflect, it shapes. But at present
even the handling of a hammer is taught with the help of a mirror, a
sensitive film which records all the movement... The deeper literature
is, and the more it is imbued with the desire to shape life, the more
significantly and dynamically will it be able to 'picture life..." Trotsky did not believe that it is possible to create
genuine proletarian art at his time. In the 1920s the Bolshevik regime
exercised a relatively tolerant cultural policy, and allowed
experimentation, if it did nor criticize the Party or the Revolution.
Trotsky did not reject Freud who was blacklisted in the Soviet Union.
He showed some understanding of the Formalist school in its attempt to
seek criteria for classification and valuation, but emphasized that the
verbal art do not end with the word. "Artistic creation is always a
complicated turning inside out of old forms, under the influence of new
stimuli which originate outside art. In this large sense of the word,
art is a handmaiden. It is not a disembodied element feeding on itself,
but a function of social man indissolubly tied to his life and
environment." Later Formalism became - in the hands of Stalinist
censors - a swearword, which ended all kinds of experiments. </p>
      <p>In
1938 Trotsky and his followers founded the Fourth
International. During the Great Purge (1934-38), a wave of terror by
which Stalin aimed at eliminating the opposition, Trotsky was accused
of espionage. Stalin found a surprising ally in Winston Churchill, who
was a consistent opponet of Communism, but saw in Trotsky an enemy of
the establisehd order. When the Soviet Union attacked Finland in 1939,
starting the Winter War, Trotsky sided with the Red Army. A supposed
family friend, Jacques van den
Dreschd, wounded Trotsky mortally on August 21, 1940 with an ice pick.

        <b><font size="2">Permanent revolution: </font></b><font size="2">Marx and Engels had predicted that the proletarian revolution
would occur first in the industrialized nations of western Europe.
Trotsky argued from his experience in 1905 that Russian bourgeois was
too weak to carry through the coming revolution which would have to be
taken over by the proletariat. The proletariat would then be deserted
by the peasantry, who would join the mass of small owners opposing the
socialist revolution. Since the proletariat in Russia was a minority,
it would not be able to maintain itself in power unless it could rely
on the help from a socialist revolution in the West. The revolution in
Russia would touch off a conflagration in the rest of Europe -
revolution in one country leads to revolution internationally. <b>"This
struggle, under conditions of an overwhelming predominance of
capitalist relationships on the world arena, must inevitably lead to
explosions, that is, internally to civil wars and externally to
revolutionary wars. Therein lies the permanent character of the
socialist revolution as such... The socialist revolution begins on the
national arena, it unfolds on the international arena, and is completed
on the world arena."</b> (from <i>The Permanent Revolution</i>, 1930)
Later the "domino theory" - a cornerstone of the U.S. foreign policy in
Southeast Asia - reflected curiously Trotskyist way of thinking: it
argued that if the U.S. did not make a stand in South Vietnam, then the
rest of the nations of Southeast Asia and beyond would accommodate to
communist power and eventually topple one after the other like a stack
of dominoes.</font></blockquote>
