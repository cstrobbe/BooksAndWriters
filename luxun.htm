<p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Short-story writer, essayist,
critic, and
literary theorist, who is considered one of the greatest figures in the
20th-century Chinese literature. In the West Lu Xun is chiefly known
for his stories, which have been translated into more than a dozen
languages. Lu Xun's acclaimed short fiction appeared in three
collections between the years 1923 and 1935. He also produced sixteen
volumes of essays, reminiscences, prose poetry, historical tales, some
sixty classical-style poems, a dozen volumes of scholarly research, and
numerous translations. Lu Xun never wrote a novel. <br>
</p>
<blockquote>'<b><font size="2">"You are a scholar and you have
been to the outside world and learned of many things. I want to ask you
about something." Her lusterless eyes suddenly lighted up as she
advanced a few steps towards me, lowered her voice, a</font><font size="2">nd said in a very earnest and confidential manner, "It is
this: is there another life after this </font><font size="2">o</font><font size="2">ne?"</font></b><font size="2">' (from 'The Widow') </font></blockquote>
<p>Lu Xun (Lu Hsün; Zhou Shuren) was born Zhou Shuren in
Shaoxing, in Zhejiang province, into an impoverished but educated
gentry family. In 1893, he went to live with his mother's family after
his grandfather, who had directed his schooling, was imprisoned. Lu Xun
received a traditional education before he attended Jiangnan Naval
Academy (1898-99) and School of Railway and Mines (1899-1902) in
Nanjing. In 1902 he went to Japan where he studied Japanese language
and then medicine at Sendai Provincial Medical School. In 1906 he
dropped out of the school to devote himself entirely to writing. While
still in Tokyo, he edited the journal <i>New Life</i>, and contributed
essays to the Communist journal <i>Henan</i>, sometimes collaboratring
with his brother Zhou Zuoren. </p>
<p>After studying privately, Lu Xun returned in 1909 to China. He
taught in Hangzhou and Shaoxing, and from 1912 to 1926 he held a post
in the ministry of education in Beijing. He was Chinese literature
instructor at National Beijing University (1920-26), and also taught at
Xiamen (Amoy) University (1926) and University of Canton (1927). </p>
<p>In 1918 Lu Xun published his famous story 'K'uangjen jih-chi'
(Diary of a Madman), which took its title deliberately from <a href="/gogol.htm">Nikolay Gogol</a>. It appeared in <i>Hsin ch'ingnien</i>,
the popular journal that initiated the intellectual revolution. Lu Xun
was a founding member of several leftist organizations, including
League of Left-Wing Writers, China Freedom League, and League for the
Defense of Civil Rights. He was also a leading figure in the May Fourth
Movement, named for a demonstration protesting the continuation of
international sponsored imperialism in China and pro-Japanese
provisions at the Paris Peace Conference. The protests led to the rise
of modernist, socially critical movement, which flourished only
briefly, about a decade, and later came to symbolize intellectual and
artistic freedom.</p>
<p>Lu Xun is considered as one of the leading forebears of
Baihua, or vernacular, literature. 'K'uangjen jih-chi' condemned the
traditional Confucian culture, but also helped gain acceptance for the
short-story form as an effective literary vehicle. The narrator, who
thinks he is held captive by cannibals, sees the oppressive nature of
tradition as a "man-eating" society. "Diary of a Madman", written in
vernacular and in first-person narrative, has been called China's first
Western-style story. Lu Xun avoided traditional omniscient narration
and replaced it with a single narrator through whose eyes the story is
filtered. With this tour de force, Lu Xun joined the vanguard of the
colloquail language movement. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Ah Q, too, was a man of strict
morals to begin with. Although we do not know whether he was guided by
some good teacher, he had always shown himself most scrupulous in
observing "strict segregation of the sexes," and was righteous enough
to denounce such heretics as the little nun and the Bogus Foreign
Devil. His view was, "All nuns must carry on in secret with monks. If a
woman walks alone on the street, she must want to seduce bad men. When
a man and a woman talk together, it must be to arranged to meet." In
order to correct such people, he would glare furiously, pass loud,
cutting remarks, or if the place were deserted, throw a small stone
from behind." </b></font><font size="2">(from 'The True Story of Ah
Q') </font></blockquote>
<p>'Ah Q cheng-chuan' (1921, The True Story of Ah Q) is Lu Xun's
most celebrated tales. It depicts an ignorant farm laborer, an
everyman, who experiences, with an utter lack of self-awareness, a
series of humiliations which he interprets as victories, and finally is
unfairly executed during the chaos of the Republican revolution of
1911. Ah Q is considerd the personification of the negative traits of
the Chinese national character. The term <i>A Quism</i> was coined to
signify the Chinese penchant for naming defeat a "spiritual victory."
While revealing Ah Q's weakness of will, the author also shows his deep
sympathy for his character. In the allegory Lu Xun sees China
unprepared to deal with the impact of Western culture and technology. </p>
<p>In several other works Lu Xun contrasted the hypocrisy of
upper-class intellectuals with the suffering of the lower-class people.
But the straightforward interpretation of his stories have often
neglected their ambiguity and metaphysical levels. His three volumes of
stories, <i>Na han</i> (1923, Call to Arms), <i>Pang huang</i> (1926,
Wandering), and <i>Gu shi xin bian</i> (1935, Old Tales Retold),
deeply influenced modern Chinese fiction. However, Lu Xun and his
younger brother Zhou Zuoren's translations of Western works, including
stories by Leonid Andreyev, Guy de Maupassant, and Henry Sienkiewich,
were received with near silence by the reading public. Besides short
stories, Lu Xun published essays and a volume of childhood memories, <i>Dawn
Blossoms Plucked at Dusk</i>. </p>
<p>Lu Xun participated actively in the literary debates of the
1920s and 1930s. He was a patron of younger writers, among whom the
best-known are Xiao Jun, <a href="/xiao.htm">Xiao Hong</a>, Duanmu
Hongliang, and Rou Shi. In the early 1920s he began to embrace Marxism,
but disappointed the underground Communist movement by refusing to join
it formally. In 1926 he received negative attention from the government
because of his support for the Beijing students' patriotic movement and
was forced to leave the city to Fujian to teach at Xiamen University.
In 1927 he went to teach at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou but
resigned from his post. In the late 1920s Lu Xun moved to Shanghai,
where he found sanctuary in the International Settlement. He was editor
of the magazines <i>Benliu</i> in 1928 and <i>Yiwen</i> in 1934.
During these years Lu Xun was the titular head of the League of
Left-Wing Writers. In 1933 he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. Lu Xun
died from tuberculosis on October 19, in 1936. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>When the generals kill, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Doctors have to save. </font><br>
<font size="2">After most are killed, </font><br>
<font size="2">A few escape the grave. </font><br>
<font size="2">It hardly makes the losses less, </font><br>
<font size="2">Alas. </font></b><br>
<font size="2">(1930, 'untitled') </font></blockquote>
<p>The collected works of Lu Xun in twenty volumes was first
published in 1938. Lu Xun's work is still widely read in China. In his
lifetime Lu Xun managed to maintain his status as an independent but
leftist artist, but since his death political factions have been
slightly nervous about his legacy and the polemical tone of his essays.
From 1949 his name was used in political campaigns by the Communists
and he was canonized by Marxist literary historians. During the <a href="/mao.htm">Cultural Revolution</a> his reputation remained
untouched although his disciplines, friends, and scholars suffered from
purges. After the death of Mao, intellectuals and writers started to
reread Lu Xun, seeing him as an anti-authoritarian individualist and a
voice of moral conscience. </p>
<p><b>Zhou Zuoren </b>(1885-1967), essayist, psychologist,
translator, the younger brother of Lu Xun. Zhou spent a long time in
Japan as a student and acquired a knowledge of Western culture and
literature. In 1909 he married Habuto Nobuko; they had one son and
three daughters. He returned to Zhejiang province in 1911 and worked in
the educational service. Like his brother, Zhou became a prominent
figure in the May Fourth Movement. This movement came to symbolize
artistic and intellectual freedom and influenced the pro-democracy
students in 1989 in Tianenmen Square. From 1931 Zhou was the dean of
the department of Japanese literature of the Peking University. During
the Sino-Japanese war (1937-1945) he collaborated with the Japanese
invaders. After the war he was imprisoned (1945-49) and then pardoned.
For the rest of his life Zhou lived in Beijing. Zhou's finest pieces
combine relaxed humor with sadness. In 'Shuili de dongxi' (1931, things
in the water) Zhou examined beliefs concerning "river ghosts," spirits
of the drowned. In 'Gui de shengzhang' (1934, the aspiring ghosts) he
pondered the question of whether or not ghosts continue to age in the
spirit world. Zhuo also wrote under the names Zhitang and Yaotang,
translated the works of Havelock Ellis into Chinese, contributed to
various journals, including <i>Xin qingnian</i>, <i>Xiaoshuo yuebao</i>,
<i>Yuzhou feng</i>, <i>Lunyu</i>, <i>Renjian shi</i>, and <i>Yusi</i>,
and published over two dozen books of essays. Lu Xun's brother<b> Zhou
Jianren</b> was a biologist and eugenicist. He made the first
translation of Darwin into Chinese. </p>
