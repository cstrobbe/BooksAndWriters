<p>Italian film director and writer, whose most famous films include <i>La Strada</i> (1955), <i>La Dolce Vita</i> (1960), and <i>8 1/2</i>
(1963). Fellini began his career as a cartoonist, journalist, and
scriptwriter. Marcello Mastroianni played in several films Fellini's
male alter ego, and Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife, was known as the
director's <i><a href="cjung.htm">anima</a></i>, feminine side.
Typical for Fellini's films is carnivalesque style and constantly
shifting boundary between illusion, studio-built artificiality, and
reality. Once he remarked, "I make pictures to tell a story, to tell
lies and to amuse." Although Fellini opposed in principle literary
adaptations and wrote all his scripts, he used works from such writers
as <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a> (<i>Tre Passi del delirio</i>), Petronius (<i>Satyricon</i>), and <a href="casanova.htm">Casanova</a>. Four of Fellini's movies won Oscars for best foreign-language film. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Everyone lives in his own fantasy world, but most people don't understand that. No one perceives the </b></font><b><i><font size="2">real</font></i><font size="2"> world. Each person simply call his private, personal fantasies the Truth. The difference is that I </font><i><font size="2">know</font></i><font size="2"> I live in a fantasy world. I prefer it that way and resent anything that disturbs my vision."</font></b><font size="2"> (Fellini in </font><i><font size="2">I, Fellini</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by </font><font size="2">Charlotte Chandler, 1995) </font></blockquote>
<p>Federico Fellini was born in Rimini into a middle-class family. Rimini later became the setting of<i> I Vitelloni</i> (1953) and <i>Amarcord</i>
(1973), dealing with the director's adolescence during the Fascist era.
For some reason, Mussolini felt antipathy towards Rimini itself,
although the town of Riccione became the dictator's favorite beach
destination. Fellini's father, Urbano, was a traveling salesman of
coffee and other
grocery specialties. Ida, Fellini's mother, came from an established
Roman family. <br>
</p>
      <p>At school Fellini was an average schoolboy but demonstrated his talents in drawing. He
was also interested in the circus and according to one story, which he
invented, he ran away from home at the age of seven to follow a
traveling circus. Fellini drew characters for his own puppet theater
and put on shows, where he played all parts. The circus become in his
films the perfect manifestation of popular entertainment, its innocence
and vulgarity. <a href="dariofo.htm">Dario Fo</a>, the Italian
playwright and director, saw clowns "synonymous with puerile
simple-mindedness, with picture-postcard ingenuousness, and with sheer
sentimentality." For Fellini the clown had been earlier "the caricature
of a well-established, ordered, peaceful society," but later in life he
felt that the clown is dying, and asked: "Who can still laugh at clown?
... All the world plays a clown now." In 1970 Fellini made for RAI, the
Italian national television and radio monopoly, <i>The Clowns</i>, which become a personal film essay about the spirit of the clown. </p>

<p>In 1938 Fellini went to Florence to study at the university, but
then continued to Rome, where he enrolled at the University of Rome's
law school. Instead of attending classes he worked for the newspaper<i> Il Popolo di Roma</i>, drew cartoons, and wrote short stories for the humorous magazine <i>Marc' Aurelio</i>.
Fellini never frequented the film clubs and later, when he was asked to
recount the fifty films he loved the most, he said: "Fifty films! Are
you kidding? I never saw that many in my entire life!" During the early
war years Fellini managed to stay out of the army but in 1943 he was
declared fit for military service. However, Fellini's military records
were apparently destroyed in a bombing and he continued writing for
radio in Rome. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1943 Fellini met Giulietta Masina, whom he married
after a four-month courtship. Masina had gained success as the co-star
of <i>Cico e Pallina</i>, a show about a young married couple scripted by Fellini. For a period he worked on the movie <span style="font-style: italic;">I cavalieri del deserto</span> (Knights of the Desert) in Libya, but had a lucky escape before the Allied forces seized control of Tripoli. <br>
 </p>

<p>After the liberation of Rome opened The Funny Face Shop with his friends, and drew caricatures of American G.I.s. 
Through his friend the actor Aldo Fabrizi, he met Roberto Rosselini, and collaborated with him as a screenwriter in 
<i>Roma Città aperta </i>(1945), a founding work of neorealism. He was also an assistant director on <i>Paisà</i> (1946). 
With the director Alberto Larruada he collaborated in <i>Luci del Varietà</i> (1951), which was based on Fellini's story. <br>
</p>
      <p>Fellini's first solo effort as a director was the semi-autobiographical film <i>Lo Sceicco bianco</i> (1952, The White Sheik). It 
was a critical and commercial failure, but started the long collaboration with the playwright Tullio Pinelli, the 
scriptwriter Ennio Flaiano (1910-1972), and the composer Nino Rota (1911-1979). With <i>I Vitelloni</i>, a tale of tale of aimless young men, Fellini 
made his international breakthrough. </p>

      <p>Fellini began as a neo-realist but gradually he developed his special imaginative, surrealistic vision of the world. His 
partnership with Tullio Pinelli (1908-2009) produced some of his most famous films, such as <i>I Vitelloni</i>, <i>La Strada</i>, 
<i>La Dolce Vita</i> and <i>8 ½</i>. <br>
      </p>
      <p><i>La Strada</i> was a version of the fairy tale <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.
"You're not going to believe me... yet everything in this world is
useful for something", says Matto (Richard Basehart) to Masina, who
played the simple-minded, childish Gelsomina. She loves beauty and is
terrorized by her brutish husband, Zampano, a strongman. After her
death Zampano has nothing. "Fellini's direction left a great deal to be
desired," wrote Diana Willing in <i>Films in Review</i>
(August/September, 1956). Although writers changed, Fellini did not
receive much understanding in the magazine. Nino Rota's theme song for
the film sold more than two million copies in Italy &#8211; Rota's long
association with Fellini had started in <i>The White Sheik</i>. In the United States <i>La Strada</i>
was chosen by the Motion Picture Academy as Best Foreign Film of 1956.
Fellini described the film as "the complete catalogue of my entire
mythological world." The films tragic qualities and bleak consistency
owe much to the style of the cinematographer Otello Martelli, who
collaborated with Fellini on four subsequent productions. <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Le notti di Cabiria</i> (1957) won Fellini his second Academy Award. "As a motion picture <i>Cabiria</i> is of no consequence, but sociologically it could have utility as an illustration of how sick Europe is", noted L.C. in <i>Films in Review </i>(December, 1957). </p>

<p><i>La Dolce Vita</i> (1960) won the Grand Prize at the 1961 Cannes
Festival. It opened with a huge statue of Jesus, which is moved by a
helicopter above the rooftops of Rome. In another famous scene Anita
Ekberg walks through Trevi Fountain. Marcello Mastroianni is a gossip
columnist who wants to be a serious writer, but he cannot escape the
decadent high society life in Rome. Instead of shooting on the famous
Via Veneto, Fellini created his own version of the street at the
Cinecittà studios. Henry Hart, who did not share the enthusiasm of other reviewers called the film a "three-hour peep-show &#8211; a carelessly written
and directed hodge-podge of skits depicting some of the follies of
contemporary Western civilization..." <font size="-1">(in <i>Films in Review </i>(June/July,
1961) </font>The success of the film enabled
Fellini to form his own production company, named Federiz. </p>
<p><i>Otto e Mezzo</i> (1963, 8 1/2), about the conflict between
commerce and art, won the best foreign film Oscar. Marcello Mastroianni
in the role of Guido Anselmi, a filmmaker, who has made precisely the
same number of films as Fellini - 8 1/2. "With Fellini I feel like a
friend, not an actor," Mastroianni once said. Guido is on the verge of
a nervous breakdown, and at the end is left without any clear idea what
to do next. In the Soviet Union the film won a first prize at the
Moscow Film Festival. All reviews were not positive. "... incidents of
fact. dream, fantasy, and imagination strung together without reason
and without art", wrote Helen Weldon Kuhn wrote<font size="-1"> (in <i>Films in Review</i>, August/September, 1963)</font>. <i>Giulietta degli Spiriti </i>(1965, Juliet of the Spirits) was Fellini's first color feature, a story of dreams, spirits, and loneliness. Andrew Sarris in <i>Village Voice</i>
(November 11&amp;18, 1965) did not like the film: "As it turned out,
Fellini missed by a mile, and I am sorry that I must write this review
more in sorrow than anger, but Juliet is barely slick enough to pass as
middlebrow entertainment on the Rose Franzblau level." </p>
<p>Fellini had read Petronius Arbiter's <i>Satyricon </i>already at school. The author lived in the times of Nero, and was regarded as director-in-chief of the imperial pleasures. <i>Satyricon</i>
was a comic romance about Encolpius, who has lost his potence but hopes
to regain it again. His companion is a pretty boy, Giton, with whom he
is in love. Encolpius's rival is Ascyltus. Fellini made the screenplay
with Bernardino Zapponi, without being too much faithful to the
original source. A major exception was the famous dinner at the villa
of Trimalchio, filmed in Cinecittà, where <i>Fellini Satyricon </i>(1969) become the most expensive film since <i>Ben-Hur</i>. <i>Satyricon</i>, called a "procession of wild orgies", continued the themes of decadence and impotence of <i>La Dolce Vita</i> and <i>8 1/2</i>. The film did well in Italy and France. </p>
<p><i>Amarcod</i>, a nostalgic and visionary journey into the
director's memories of his youth, was awarded with best foreign film
Oscar. Fellini recreated his imaginary Rimini in Cinecittà. In one
magic scene people in small boats greet enthusiastically a painted
ship, which disappears in the fog. The cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno
shot three more films for Fellini, from <span style="font-style: italic;">Casanova</span> (1976) up to <span style="font-style: italic;">E la Nave va</span> (1983). <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Casanova</i>, starring Donald Sutherland in a false nose and chin, received mixed critics. The American writer <a href="vidal.htm">Gore Vidal </a>worked some time with the script, but Fellini did not like the changes he made in the story. <i>La Città delle Donne</i> (1980, City of Women) and <i>Casanova </i>failed at the box office, and also <i>E la Nave va</i>
(And the Ship Sails On) did not encourage bankers to finance Fellini's
movies. Although Fellini had refused to make commercials, he made one
for the apéritif, Campari, in 1984. The nostalgic <i>Ginger and Fred </i>(1985),
starring Giulietta Masina and Marcello Mastroianni, was a homage to
small-time entertainers. Marina was a retired tap dancer who is
reunited with her former dance partner and lover for a Christmas
television special. </p>
<p>Fascinated by the work of the Peruvian writer and anthropologist&nbsp;<a href="castane.htm">Carlos Castaneda</a>, Fellini planned to make a film about shamans, legends, and rituals of the ancient Aztecs. <span class="st"><span class="ft">After
many fruitless attempts to get in touch with Castaneda, he began to
suspect that the author didn't really exist. When they finally met in
Rome, Fellini was disappointed. He found nothing in Castaneda's stocky
physical appearance to suggest that he's a shaman or initiated.
Nevertheless, Fellini</span></span> made a trip to Mexico, where a
native shaman got&nbsp;him involved in a ritual, in which he saw
hallucinations. Castaneda had recommened that the director never try
peyote, because "considering how much he ate, it would be
disastrous."&nbsp;Fellini's screenplay, entitled<em> Viaggio a Tulun</em>, was adapted by the noted Italian cartoonist Milo Manera as <em>Viaggio a Tulum</em> and published in the magazine <em><a href="hugoprat.htm">Corto Maltese</a> </em>in 1989.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Intervista </em>(1987),
which was awarded a Special Prize at Cannes, marked Fellini's&nbsp;last
appearance in feature film. At the 1992 Academy Awards he received a
Lifetime Achievement Award. Federico Fellini died of cardiac arrest on
October 31, 1993 at the Umberto I Hospital in Rome, after having choked
a piece of food while dining in a restaurant. His corpse was
transferred to Rimi where he was buried in the family tomb. </p>
