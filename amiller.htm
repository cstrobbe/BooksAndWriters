<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American playwright who combined in his
works social
awareness with deep insights into personal weaknesses of his
characters'.
Miller is best known for the play <span style="font-style: italic;">Death
of a Salesman</span> (1949), or on the other hand, for his marriage
to the actress Marilyn Monroe. Miller's plays continued the realistic
tradition that began in the United States in the period between the two
world wars. With <a href="/williams.htm">Tennessee Williams</a>,
Miller was one of the best-known American playwrights after WW II.
Several of his works were filmed by such director as John Huston,
Sidney Lumet and Karel Reiz. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Don't say he's a great man. Willy
Loman never made a lot of money. His name was never in the paper. He's
not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a
terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not
to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention,
attention must finally paid to such a person." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Death of a Salesman</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Arthur Miller was born in Harlem, New York City; the family
moved shortly afterwards to a six-storey building at 45110th Street
between Lenox and Fifth Avenues. His father, Isidore Miller, was an
illiterate Jewish immigrant from Poland. His succesfull ladies-wear
manufacturer and shopkeeper was ruined in the depression. Augusta
Barnett, Miller's mother, was born in New York, but her father came
from the same Polish town as the Millers. </p>
      <p>The sudden change in fortune had a strong influence on Miller.
"This desire to move on, to metamorphose &#8211; or perhaps it is a talent
for being contemporary &#8211; was given me as life's inevitable and righful
condition," he wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Timebends: A
Life</span> (1987). The family moved to a small frame house in
Brooklyn, which is said to the model for the Brooklyn home in <i>Death
of a Salesman</i>. Miller spent his boyhood playing foorball and
baseball, reading adventure stories, and appearing generally as a
nonintellectual. "If I had any ideology at all it was what I had
learned from Hearst newspapers," he once said. After graduating from a
high school in 1932, Miller worked in automobile parts warehouse to
earn money for college. Having read Dostoevsky's novel <i>The Brothers
Karamazov</i> Miller decided to become a writer. To study journalism he
entered the University of Michigan in 1934, where he won awards for
playwriting &#8211; one of the other awarded playwright was Tennessee
Williams. </p>
      <p>After graduating in English in 1938, Miller returned to New
York. There he joined the Federal Theatre Project, and wrote scripts
for radio programs, such as Columbia Workshop (CBS) and Cavalcade of
America (NBC). Because of a football injury, he was exempt from draft.
In 1940 Miller married a Catholic girl, Mary Slattery, his college
sweetheart, with whom he had two children. Miller's first play to
appear on Broadway was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man Who
Had All The Luck</span> (1944). It closed after four performances.
Three years later produced <span style="font-style: italic;">All My
Sons</span> was about a factory owner who sells faulty aircraft parts
during World War II. It won the New York Drama Critics Circle award and
two Tony Awards. In 1944 Miller toured Army camps to collect background
material for the screenplay <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Story of G.I. Joe</span> (1945). Miller's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">FOCUS </span>(1945), was about
anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Miller's plays often depict how families are destroyed by
false values. Especially his earliest efforts show his admiration for
the classical Greek dramatists. "When I began to write," he said in an
interview, "one assumed inevitably that one was in the mainstream that
began with Aeschylus and went through about twenty-five hundred years
of playwriting." <font size="2">(from </font><font size="2"><i>The
Cambridge Companion to Arthur Miller</i>, ed. by Christopher Bigsby,
1997) </font></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Death of a Salesman</span>
brought Miller international fame, and become one of the major
achievements of modern American theatre. It relates the tragic story of
a salesman named Willy Loman, whose past and present are mingled in
expressionistic scenes. Loman is not the great success that he claims
to be to his family and friends. The postwar economic boom has shaken
up his life. He is eventually fired and he begins to hallucinate about
significant events from his past. Linda, his wife, believes in the
American Dream, but she also keeps her feet on the ground. Deciding
that he is worth more dead than alive, Willy kills himself in his car &#8211;
hoping that the insurance money will support his family and his son
Biff could get a new start in his life. Critics have disagreed whether
his suicide is an act of cowardice or a last sacrifice on the altar of
the American Dream. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>WILLY: I'm not interested in
stories about the past or any crap of that kind because the woods are
burning, boys, you understand? There's a big blaze going on all around.
I was fired today. </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">BIFF (shocked): How could you be? </font><br>
        <font size="2">WILLY: I was fired, and I'm looking for a little
good news to tell your mother, because the woman has waited and the
woman has suffered. The gist of it is that I haven't got a story left
in my head, Biff. So don't give me a lecture about facts and aspects. I
am not interested. Now what've you got so say to me? </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Death of a
Salesman</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1949 Miller was named an "Outstanding Father of the Year",
which manifested his success as a famous writer. But the wheel of
fortune was going down. In the 1950s Miller was subjected to a scrutiny
by a committee of the United States Congress investigating Communist
influence in the arts. The FBI read his play <i>The Hook</i>, about a
militant union
organizer, and he was denied a passport to attend the Brussels premiere
of his play <span style="font-style: italic;">The Crucible</span>
(1953). It was based on court records and historical personages of the
Salem witch trials of 1692. In Salem one could be hanged because of
''the inflamed human imagination, the poetry of suggestion.'' The
daughter of Salem's minister falls mysteriously ill. Reverend Samuel
Parris is a widower, and there is very little good to be said for him.
He believes he is persecuted wherever he goes. Rumours of witchcraft
spread throughout the people of Salem. "The times, to their eyes, must
have been out of joint, and to the common folk must have seemed as
insoluble and complicated as do ours today." The minister accuses
Abigail Williams of wrongdoing, but she transforms the accusation into
plea for help: her soul has been bewitched. Young girls, led by
Abigail, make accusations of witchcraft against townspeople whom they
do not like. Abigail accuses Elizabeth Proctor, the wife of an
upstanding farmer, whom she had once seduced. Elizabeth's husband John
Proctor reveals his past lechery. Elizabeth, unaware, fails to confirm
his testimony. To protect him she testifies falsely that her husband
has not been intimate with Abigail. Proctor is accused of witchcraft
and condemned to death. </p>
      <p><i>The Crucible</i>, which received Antoinette Perry Award,
was an allegory for the McCarthy era and mass hysteria. Although its
first Broadway production flopped, it become one of Miller's
most-produced play. Miller wrote <i>The Crucible</i> in the atmosphere
in which the author saw "accepted the notion that conscience was no
longer a private matter but one of state administration." In the play
he expressed his faith in the ability of an individual to resist
conformist pressures. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You know, sometimes God mixes up
the people. We all love somebody, the wife, the kids - every man's got
somebody he loves, heh? Bus sometimes... there's too much. You know?
There's too much, and it goes where it mustn't. A man works hard, he
brings up a child, sometimes it's niece, sometimes even a daughter, and
he never realizes it, but through the years - there is too much love
for the daughter, there is too much love for the niece."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">A View from the Bridge</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Elia Kazan, with whom Miller had shared an artistic vision and
for a period a girlfriend, the motion-picture actress Marilyn Monroe,
named in 1952 eight former reds, who had been in the Communist Party
with him. Kazan virtually became a pariah overnight, Miller remained a
hero of the Left. Two short plays under the collective title <span style="font-style: italic;">A View from the Bridge</span> were
successfully produced in 1955. The drama, dealing with incestuous love,
jealousy and betrayal, was also an answer to Kazan's film <i>On the
Waterfront</i> (1954), in which the director justified his naming names.</p>
      <p>In 1956 Miller was awarded honorary degree at the University
of Michigan but also called before the House Committee on Un-American
Activities. Miller admitted that he had attended certain meetings, but
denied that he was a Communist. He had attended among others four or
five writers's meetings sponsored by the Communist Party in 1947,
supported a Peace Conference at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, and
signed many apppeals and protests. "Marilyn's fiance admits aiding
reds," wrote the press. Refusing to offer other people's names, who had
associated with leftist or suspected Communist groups, Miller was cited
for contempt of Congress, but the ruling was reversed by the courts in
1958. </p>
      <p>Miller &#8211; "the man who had all the luck" &#8211; married Marilyn
Monroe in 1956; they divorced in 1961. At that time Marilyn was beyond
saving. She died in 1962. </p>
      <p>In the late 1950s Miller wrote nothing for the theatre. His
screenplay <span style="font-style: italic;">Misfits&nbsp;</span> was
written with a role for his wife. The film was directed by John Huston,
starring Mongomery Clift, Clark Gable, and Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn was
always late getting to the set and used heavily drugs. The marriage was
already breaking, and Miller was feeling lonely. John Huston wrote in
his book of memoir, <i>An Open Book</i>, (1980): "One evening I was
about to drive away from the location &#8211; miles out in the desert &#8211; when
I saw Arthur standing alone. Marilyn and her friends hadn't offered him
a ride back; they'd just left him. If I hadn't happened to see him, he
would have been stranded out there. My sympathies were more and more
with him." Later Miller said that there "should have been more long
shots to remind us constantly how isolated there people were,
physically and morally." Miller's last play, <span style="font-style: italic;">Finishing the Picture</span>, produced in
2004, depicted the making of <i>Misfits</i>. </p>
      
      <p>Miller was politically active throughout his life. In 1965 he
was elected president of P.E.N., the international literary
organization. At the 1968 Democratic Party Convention he was a delegate
for Eugene McCarthy. In 1964 Miller returned to stage after a nine-year
absence with the play <span style="font-style: italic;">After the Fall</span>,
a strongly autobiographical work, which dealt with the questions of
guilt and innocence. The play also united Kazan and Miller, but their
close friendship was over, destroyed by the blacklist. Many critics
consider that Maggie, the self-destructive central character, was
modelled on Monroe, though Miller denied this. A year after his
divorce, Miller married the Austrian photographer Inge Morath
(1923-2002), whom he had met during the filming of <i>The Misfits</i>.
Miller co-operated with her on two books about China and Russia. After
Inge Morath died, Miller plannd to marry Agnes Barley, a 34-year-old
artist. In 1985 Miller went to Turkey with the playwright Harold
Pinter. Their journey was arranged by PEN in conjunction with the
Helsinki Watch Committee. One of their guides in Istanbul was Orhan
Pamuk. </p>
      <p>In the 1990s Miller wrote such plays as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ride Down Mount Morgan</span> (prod.
1991) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Last Yankee </span>(prod.
1993), but in an interview he stated that "It happens to be a very bad
historical moment for playwriting, because the theater is getting more
and more difficult to find actors for, since television pays so much
and the movies even more than that. If you're young, you'll probably be
writing about young people, and that's easier -- you can find young
actors -- but you can't readily find mature actors."<font size="2">
('We're Probably in an Art That Is -- Not Dying' , </font><font size="2"><i>The New York Times</i>, </font><font size="2">January 17,
1993) </font> In 2002 Miller was honored with Spain's prestigious
Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature, making him the first U.S.
recipient of the award. Miller died of heart failure at home in
Roxbury, Connecticut, on February 10, 2005. </p>
