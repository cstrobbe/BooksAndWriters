<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->New Zealand's most famous writer, who was
closely associated with D.H. Lawrence and something of a rival of
Virginia Woolf. Mansfield's creative years were burdened with
loneliness, illness, jealousy, alienation &#8211; all this reflected in her
work with the bitter depiction of marital and family relationships of
her middle-class characters. Her short stories are also notable for
their use of stream of consciousness. Like the Russian writer Anton
Chekhov, Mansfield depicted trivial events and subtle changes in human
behavior. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Henry was a great fellow for books. He
did not read many nor did he possess above half a dozen. He looked at
all in the Charing Cross Road during lunch-time and at any odd time in
London; the quantity with which he was on nodding terms was amazing. By
his clean neat handling of them and by his nice choice of phrase when
discussing them with one or another bookseller you would have thought
that he had taken his pap with a tome propped before his nurse's bosom.
But you would have been wrong." </b>(from 'Something Childish But Very Natural') </font></blockquote>
<p>Katherine Mansfield was born in Wellington, New Zealand, into a
middle-class colonial family. Her father, Harold Beauchamp, was a
banker and her mother, Annie Burnell Dyer, was of genteel origins. She
lived for six years in the rural village of Karori. Later on Mansfield
said "I imagine I was always writing. Twaddle it was, too. But better
far write twaddle or anything, anything, than nothing at all." At the
age of nine she had her first story published. Entitled 'Enna Blake' it
appeared in <i>The High School Reporter</i> in Wellington, with the editor's comment, that it "shows promise of great merit". </p>
<p>As a first step to her rebellion against her background, she
withdrew to London in 1903 and studied at Queen's College, where she
joined the staff of the <i>College Magazine</i>. Back in New Zealand
in 1906, she then took up music, and had affairs with both men and
women. Her father denied her the opportunity to become a professional
cello player &#8211; she was an accomplished violoncellist. In 1908 she
studied typing and bookkeeping at Wellington Technical College. Her
lifelong friend Ida Baker (L.M., Leslie Moore in her diary and
correspondence) persuaded Mansfield's father to allow Katherine to move
back to England, with an allowance of £100 a year. There she devoted
herself to writing. Mansfield never visited New Zealand again. </p>
<p>After an unhappy marriage in 1909 to George Brown, whom she left a
few days after the wedding, Mansfield toured for a while as an extra in
opera. Before the marriage she had an affair with Garnett Trowell, a
musician, and became pregnant. In Bavaria, where Mansfield spent some
time, she suffered a miscarriage. During her stay in Germany she wrote
satirical sketches of German characters, which were published in 1911
under the title <i>In a German Pension</i>. Earlier her stories had appeared in <i>The New Age</i>.
On her return to London, Mansfield became ill with an untreated
sexually transmitted disease she contracted from Floryan Sobieniowski;
a condition which contributed to her weak health for the rest of her
life. Sobieniowski was a Polish émigré translator, whom she met in
Germany. Her first story published in England was 'The
Child-Who-Was-Tired', about a overworked nursemaid who kills a baby &#8211;
it has been claimed that it was a copy of Chekhov's story 'Spat
Khochetsia' (1888, Sleepyhead).</p>
<p>Mansfield attended literary parties without much enthusiasm: "Pretty
rooms and pretty people, pretty coffee, and cigarettes out of a silver
tankard... I was wretched." Always outspoken, she was once turned out
of an omnibus after calling another woman a whore; the woman had
declared that all suffragettes ought to be trampled to death by horses.
In 1911 she met John Middleton Murry, a Socialist and former literary
critic, who was first a tenant in her flat, then her lover. Mansfield
co-edited and contributed to a series of journals. Until 1914 she
published stories in <i>Rhythm</i> and <i>The Blue Review</i>. During
the war she travelled restlessly between England and France. When her
brother "Chummie"died in World War I, Mansfield focused her writing on
New Zealand and her family. 'Prelude' (1916), one of her most famous
stories, was written during this period. After divorcing her first
husband in 1918, Mansfield married Murry. In the same year she was
found to have tuberculosis. </p>
<p>Mansfield and Murry were closely associated with D.H. Lawrence and
his wife Frieda. Upon learning that Murry had an affair with the
Princess Bibesco (née Asquith), Mansfield objected not to the affair
but to her letters to Murry: "I am afraid you must stop writing these
love letters to my husband while he and I live together. It is one of
the things which is not done in our world." (from a letter to Princess
Bibesco, 1921) </p>
<p>Mansfield did her best work in the early 1920s, the peak of her achievement being the <i>Garden Party </i>(1922),
which she wrote during the final stages of her illness. At the
suggestion of her friend Anne Estelle Rice, the American painter, she
took a room in the Victoria-Palacewhen she arrived in Paris for
radiation treatments from Dr. Ivan Manoukhin
. Though the hotel was rather costly and she had separated from her
husband, Mansfield managed to pay her bills. Her quarters were
considerably better than the barn near Fontainebleau in which she died
a year later. With the financial support of his patron Harriet Weaver,
James Joyce and his family took rooms at the Victoria-Palace
Hôtelduring 1923-24. Before moving to Georgei Gurdjieff commune,
Mansfield lived at the Hôtel Select for three weeks in October 1922. <br>
</p>
      <p>Her last years Mansfield spent in southern France and in
Switzerland, seeking relief from tuberculosis. As a part of her
treatment in 1922 at an institute, Mansfield had to lie a few hours
every day on a platform suspended over a cow manger. She breathed odors
emanating from below but the treatment did no good. Without the company
of her literary friends, family, or her husband, she wrote much about
her own roots and her childhood. Mansfield died of a pulmonary
hemorrhage on January 9, 1923, in Gurdjieff Institute, near
Fontainebleau, France. Her last words were: "I love the rain. I want
the feeling of it on my face." </p>

<p>Mansfield's family memoirs were collected in <i>Bliss </i>(1920).
Only three volumes of Mansfield's stories were published during her
lifetime. 'Miss Brill' was about a woman who enjoys the beginning of
the Season. She goes to her "special" seat with her fur. She had taken
it out of its box in the afternoon, shaken off the moth-powder, and
given it a brush. She feels that she has a part in the play in the
park, and somebody will notice if she isn't there. A couple sits near
her. The girl laughs at her fur and the man says: "Why does she come
here at all &#8211; who wants her? Why doesn't she keep her silly old mug at
home?" Miss Brill hurries back home, unclasps the neckpiece quickly,
and puts it in the box. "But when she put the lid on she thought she
heard something crying." </p>
<p>In 'The Garden Party' (1921) an extravagant garden-party is arranged
on a beautiful day. Laura, the daughter of the party's hostess, hears
of the accidental death of a young local working-class man, Mr. Scott.
The man lived in the neighborhood. Laura wants to cancel the party, but
her mother refuses to understand. She fills a basket with sandwiches,
cakes, pastries and other food, goes to the widow's house, and sees the
dead man in the bedroom where he is lying. "He was wonderful,
beautiful. While they were laughing and while the band was playing,
this marvel had come to the lane." Crying she tells her brother who is
looking for her: "'It was simply marvellous. But, Laurie &#8211; ' She
stopped, she looked at her brother. 'Isn't life,' she stammered, 'isn't
life &#8211; ' But what life was she couldn't explain. No matter. He quite
understood." </p>
<p>Mansfield was greatly influenced by <a href="tsehov.htm">Anton Chekhov</a>,
sharing his warm humanity and attention to small details of human
behavior. Her influence on the development of the modern short story
was also notable. Among her literary friends were Aldous Huxley,
Virginia Woolf, who considered her overpraised, and <a href="dhlawren.htm">D.H. Lawrence</a>,
who later turned against Murry and her. Mansfield's journal, letters,
and scrapbook were edited by her husband, who ignored her wish that he
should "tear up and burn as much as possible" of the papers she left
behind her. </p>
