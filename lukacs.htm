<P>Hungarian literary historian, essayist, critic, an influential and controversial figure in the Western Marxist tradition. Although Luk&aacute;cs supported the aesthetic doctrine of socialism realism, most of his life Luk&aacute;cs was viewed with suspicion by Communist Party ideologists. Luk&aacute;cs's <I>History and Class Consciousness </I>(1923) was attacked by the Russian Communist Party leaders and Luk&aacute;cs later regretted the "messianic utopianism" of this work. Luk&aacute;cs's aesthetics that opposed political control of artists was hailed by the New Left intellectuals in the 1960s. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><STRONG>"In the writing of the Stalinist period, however, the real problems were overlooked and&nbsp;</STRONG>–<STRONG> as with economic subjectivism&nbsp;</STRONG>–<STRONG> the correctness of particular solutions became a matter for dogmatism. Literature ceased to reflect the dynamic contradictions of social life; it became the illustration of an abstract "truth." The aesthetic consequences of such an approach are all too evident. Even where this "truth" was in fact true and not, as so often, a lie or a half-truth, the notion of literature-as-illustration was extremely detrimental to good writing."</STRONG> (from <I>The Meaning of Contemporary Realism</I>, 1962) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Gy&ouml;rgy Szegedy von Luk&aacute;cs (also known as Georg Luk&aacute;cs) was born in Budapest into a wealthy Jewish family. His father, J&oacute;zsef L&ouml;winger, was a prominent Hungarian banker, his German-speaking mother Adele Wertheimer came from Vienna. The family Magyarized in 1890&nbsp;its name of L&ouml;winger into Luk&aacute;cs. J&oacute;zsef was ennobled in 1899. </P><P>Jewishness played little role in Luk&aacute;cs's upbringing who was baptized a Lutheran. He&nbsp;studied at the universities of Budapest and Berlin, receiving his Ph.D. in 1906 for his book on modern drama. After travels in Italy, he lived in Heidelberg from 1912 to 1916 and studied privately with Heinrich Rickert. During this period he became associated with the German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920), later developed Weber's ideal type methodology. In his early point of career Luk&aacute;cs described himself as a "subjective idealist" and his writings showed interest in neo-Kantian thought, fashionable in pre-First World War Central European intellectual circles. From <I>The Theory of the Novel</I> (1920) Hegel remained for Luk&aacute;cs a lifelong source of inspiration. </P>
<P>In 1917 Luk&aacute;cs returned to Budapest, where he became the leading figure of The Budapest Sunday Circle, which&nbsp;included Karl Mannheim, the art historian <A href="hauser.htm">Arnold Hauser</A>, the writers B&eacute;la Bal&aacute;zs and Anna Leznai, and the musicians B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k and Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly. Usually the group met at Bal&aacute;zs's elegant apartment or the Luk&aacute;cs's country estate and discussed about the end of the liberal society. Most of the members left Hungary after the revolution of 1919. After conversion to Marxism and historical materialism, Luk&aacute;cs dropped the honorific 'von' from his publications. His undercover name in the Communist Party of Hungary&nbsp;(KMP) was 'Blum'. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"If Faust could have two souls within his breast, why should not a normal person unite conflicting intellectual trends within himself when he finds himself changing from one class to another in the middle of a world crisis? In so far as I am able to recall those years, I, at least, find that my ideas hovered between the acquisition of Marxism and political activism on the one hand, and the constant intensification of my purely idealistic ethical preoccupations on the other." </B>(</FONT><FONT size=2>from <I>History &amp; Class Consciousness</I></FONT><I><FONT size=2></FONT></I><FONT size=2>, Preface to the New Edition, 1967) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>World War I had radicalized Luk&aacute;cs's thinking and he joined in 1918 the newly formed KMP, founded by B&eacute;la Kun. However, before this decision he had doubted that Bolshevism can bring any good out of evil. After changing his view Luk&aacute;cs accepted that terror was legitimate in the socialist context. During B&eacute;la Kun's short-lived government, Luk&aacute;cs became Commissar of Public Education. When the Hungarian Communist Republic was overthrown by Romanian troops, Luk&aacute;cs fled to Austria and Kun to the Soviet Union where he died in one of the Stalinist purges before World War II. In his diary Bal&aacute;sz described Luk&aacute;cs's haunted appearance in Vienna – he was "deathly pale, hollow cheeked, impatient and sad", and who went "around with a gun in his pocket," tracking down people who have disappeared with party funds. Luk&aacute;cs was also portrayed by <A href="tmann.htm">Thomas Mann</A> in <I>The Magic Mountain</I>, in which the Jewish-Jesuit character, Naphta, was partly modelled on him. </P>
<P>Luk&aacute;cs's marriage to Ljena Grabenko, a Russian emigrant who turned him into a nervous wreck, ended after some years, and in 1919 he married Gertrud Bortstieber, the daughter of a rabbi. From 1919 to 1929 Luk&aacute;cs lived in Vienna, where he published <I>History and Class Consciousness </I>(1923), a collection of essays about literature and politics. The work was born under a highly contradictory amalgam of theories from Kierkegaard to Hegel and from Marx to Georges Sorel and <A href="luxembur.htm">Rosa Luxemburg</A>. Luk&aacute;cs argued that consciousness depends upon class position: different classes have different forms of consciousness, but only proletariat's point of view coincides with objectivity and truth. In freeing itself, the proletariat frees mankind: its class interest converges with Hegelian teleology of history itself. Socialism would abolish alienation which Luk&aacute;cs identified with objectification, particularly as a societal category. Later in his preface to the new edition of the book (1967), Luk&aacute;cs wrote: "...objectification is indeed a phenomenon that cannot be eliminated from human life in society. If we bear in mind that every externalisation of an object in practice (and hence, too, in work) is an objectification that every human expression including speech objectifies human thoughts and feelings, then it is clear that we are dealing with a universal mode of commerce between men." <B></B><FONT size=2></FONT></P>
<P><I>History and Class Consciousness</I> was attacked by Lenin and Grigory Zinovyev (1883-1936) and other leaders of the Russian Communist party; the seminal work wrecked Luk&aacute;cs's political career. He repudiated it in a public confession in the 1930s, the period of Stalin's show trials, and saved himself from the fate of Zinovyev who was executed in 1936. He was also accused of abandoning the doctrine of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat" and replacing it with the concept of a 'democratic dictatorship'. </P><P>When the Austrian government attempted to expel Luk&aacute;cs, Mann pleaded for him to be allowed to remain in Vienna. Nevertheless, he decided the leave the country. In 1929-30 Luk&aacute;cs was associated in Moscow with the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, run by David Riazonov who was killed in Stalin's purges. Between 1931 and 1933 he lived in Berlin, where he was a leading figure&nbsp;in the League of Proletarian and Revolutionary Writers (BPRS), which included such names as Johannes R. Becher, Anna Seghers, Friedrich Wolf, and Ludwig Renn. After Hitler was elected chancellor of German, Luk&aacute;cs emigrated to the Soviet Union. He worked as a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and&nbsp;wrote such studies as&nbsp;<EM>A t&ouml;rt&eacute;nelmi reg&eacute;ny</EM> (1937 The Historical Novel) and <EM>Der junge Hegel</EM> (1938, The Young Hegel). Though he supported Stalin's basic policies, even the the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of 1939, Luk&aacute;cs was arrested and put in the notorius Lubyanka gaol after the German invasion of Russia. Before&nbsp;he was released,&nbsp;Luk&aacute;cs wrote his autobiography. </P>
<P>After World War II Luk&aacute;cs returned to Hungary. From 1945 to 1956&nbsp;he was professor of aesthetics and cultural philosophy at the University of Budapest.&nbsp; He served as editor of the journal <I>Forum </I>and advocated "socialist humanism" in the arts. In 1949 opposition political parties were outlawed and the Hungarian Communist Party proclaimed Hungary a People's Republic. During the R&aacute;kosi era Luk&aacute;cs focused mostly on scientific research. One of his major works was <I>Die Zerst&ouml;rung der Vernuft</I> (1954), a book against irrationalism. In 1956 he demanded the renaissance of Marxism against Stalinist dogmatism in a speech he made in the Pet&ouml;fi-circle, which later has been called as "unintended initiator of the Hungarian Revolution." Luk&aacute;cs's writing did not gain the approval of the new authorities and J&oacute;zsef R&eacute;vai, the chief ideologist of the Party, attacked Luc&aacute;cs's "bourgeois realism." In 1956, when the reformist prime minister Imre Nagy declared Hungary neutral, he was appointed Minister of Culture. However, Soviet troops destroyed the unplanned uprising in November. Some 200,000 Hungarians fled the country, Nagy was executed, and Luk&aacute;cs was deported for a while to Romania. He was allowed to return to Budapest in 1957, and after attacks on him in 1958 he regained political favor in mid-1960s. Luk&aacute;cs died on June 4, 1971 in Budapest, where he was buried with all due Party honors. His last major work was <I>Zur Ontologie des gesellschaftslichen Seins</I> (1971-1973). Luk&aacute;cs aesthetic theories have influenced Walter Benjamin (1892-1940), Frankfurt School, and the French-Romanian theorist Lucien Goldman (1913-1970), who devised the method of literary analysis known as "genetic structruralism", which sought to identify homologies or structural parallels between literary texts and the worldviews of key social groups contemporary with the texts. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"Luk&aacute;cs until his death clung to an ideology which seems more and more utopian: a vision of a social paradise, of the end of the alienation of man for which there is no evidence in any Communist or other society. As a character in <I>The First Circle </I>remarks: "if you always look over your shoulder how can you still remain a human being?" Luk&aacute;cs looked or had to look over his shoulder all his adult life and found solace only in a distant messianic hope."</B> (Ren&eacute; Wellek in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>A History of Modern Criticism 1970-1950</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, vol. 7, 1991) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Luk&aacute;cs's first important study of aesthetics was published in 1909 in the Budapest review <I>Nyugat</I>. His early writings reveal the immense amount of reading, which he had undertaken from his youth. Luk&aacute;cs was early interested in theatre, he had read hundreds of plays and at the age of seventeen he went to Olso to see Ibsen. He also translated Ibsen's play <I>The Wild Duck</I>. Poetry did not interest him much, his main concerns were the drama and the epic. <I>A l&eacute;lek &eacute;s a form&aacute;k</I> (1910, Soul and Form), a collection of essays, established his literary reputation. Partly the work was a result of his tragic love affair with Irma Seidler, who committed suicide, but also is was a product of Luk&aacute;cs's early friendship with Max Weber and Georg Simmel. In the Kierkegaard-Regine Olsen relationship he saw connections to his own experiences with Seidler. Luk&aacute;cs declared in an essay on Kierkegaard: "There is no system in life. In life there is only the separate and individual, the concrete. To exist is to be different." </P>
<P>Luk&aacute;cs two lecture series for Heidelberg, <I>Philosophie der Kunst</I> (1912-1914) and <I>Heidelberger Aesthetik</I> (1916-1918) were born under the influence of neo-Kantianism. <I>Theorie des Romans</I>, written in 1914-15 and published in book form in 1920, showed Luk&aacute;cs's interest in Hegel, but also to Schiller's <I>&Uuml;ber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung</I>, which contrasts the ideal world, found in the ancient past, and the modern world. </P>
<P>In <I>The Historical Novel</I>, written in 1936-37, Luk&aacute;cs started from Sir Walter Scott's novels to show the historical consciousness in literature. Luk&aacute;cs did not consider Scott a romantic but a great realist, who depicted the conflict of classes. Thus the&nbsp;role of literature&nbsp;had political significance, too. After 1948 the historical novel declined but showed again revival in the works of Anatole France, Romain Rolland, and Heinrich Mann. </P>
<P>In the 1960s Luk&aacute;cs became interested in the works of <A href="alesol.htm">Solzhenitsyn</A> and praised his work as a "rebirth of noble beginnings of Socialist Realism." Although Luk&aacute;cs was a supporter of the official Soviet aesthetic doctrine of social realism, he did not accept it wholeheartedly, but deloped his own version known as "critical realism." Realism was not for Luk&aacute;cs a "style" but "the basis of every literature" (in <I>Probleme des Realismus</I>). He opposed modernism, and attacked such writers as Joyce and Kafka for making technique an end itself – and nearly all major avant-garde writers in Western literature who deviated from nineteenth-century Realism. He also criticized <A href="brecht.htm">Bertolt Brecht</A>'s dramatic theories in 1934 and German Expressionism, which&nbsp;brought him&nbsp;in confrontation with other Marxists in Berlin. Brecht was greatly upset and answered with cryptic critique of Luk&aacute;cs, playing with the connotations of 'realism', 'formalism' and 'popular': "If someone makes a statement which is untrue – or irrelevant merely because it rhymes, then he is a formalist. But we have innumerable works of an unrealistic kind which did not become so because they were based on an excessive sense of form..." <FONT size=2>(</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Pictures of Reality</FONT></I><FONT size=2> by Terry Lovell, 1980) </FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"Today the primacy of the object and aesthetic realism are almost absolutely opposed to each other, and indeed when measured by the standard of realism: Beckett is more realistic that the socialist realists who counterfeit reality by their very principle. If they took reality seriously enough they would eventually realize what Luk&aacute;cs condemned when during the days of his imprisonment in Romania he is reported to have said that he had finally realized that Kafka was a realist writer."</B> (</FONT><A href="adorno.htm"><FONT size=2>Adorno</FONT></A><FONT size=2> in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Aesthetic Theory</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1997) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In his discussion of 'reification' Luk&aacute;cs was among the first to re-introduce the idea of alienation as central to Marx's thought. According to Luk&aacute;cs, the formal fragmentation of modernist texts participate in the process of reification. Realism is the only literary mode capable of representing the totality of society. Bourgeois thought is repeated in naturalism and subjectivism. Naturalism is degraded form of realism and limits itself to description instead of narration. Subjectivist art elevates art as the product of the superior subjective consciousness of the creative artist. "The goal of art is to provide a picture of reality in which the contradiction between appearance and reality, the particular and the general, the immediate and the conceptual, etc., is so resolved that the two converge into a spontaneous integrity... The Universal appears as a quality of the individual and the particular, reality becomes manifest and can be experienced within appearance."<FONT size=2> (Luk&aacute;cs in <I>Writer and Critic</I>, 1970, from <I>Pictures of Reality</I> by Terry Lovell, 1980)</FONT></P>
