      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->British novelist,
playwright,
short-story
writer, highest paid author in the world in the 1930s. In spite of his
popularity and international fame, Maugham did not receive critical
attention for his fiction in Britain. Expressing his frustration with
the situation Maugham wrote in his autobiography <em>The Summing Up</em>&nbsp;(1938),
that he stood "in the very first row of the
second-raters". Maugham's skill in handling plot has been compared with
the
manner of <a href="../../../maupassa.htm">Guy de Maupassant</a>. His
stories are told in clear, economical style with cynical or resigned
undertone.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I have never pretended to be
anything but a story teller. It has amused me to tell stories and I
have told a great many. It is a misfortune for me that the telling of a
story just for the sake of the story is not an activity that is in
favor with the intelligentsia. In endeavor to bear my misfortunes with
fortitude." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Creatures of
Circumstance</font></i><font size="2">, 1947) </font></blockquote>
      <p>William Somerset Maugham was born in Paris, the sixth and
youngest son of the solicitor to the British embassy. Maugham learned
French as his native tongue. At the age of 10, Maugham was orphaned and
sent to England to live with his uncle, the Reverend Henry MacDonald
Maugham. Educated at King's School, Canterbury, where he developed a
stammer that he never outgrew, and Heidelberg University, Maugham then
studied six years medicine in London. He qualified in 1897 as doctor
from St. Thomas' medical
school, but abandoned medicine after the success of his first novels
and
plays. </p>
      <p>Maugham lived in Paris for ten years as a struggling young
author. In 1897 appeared his first novel, <em>Liza of Lambeth</em>,
which drew on his experiences of attending women in childbirth. Maugham
named his daughter and only child, Elizabeth 'Liza' Mary Maugham, after
the title character. His first play, <em>A Man of Honour</em>, was
produced in 1903. Four of his dramas ran simultaneously in London in
1904. <br>
</p>
      <p>Maugham's breakthrough novel was the semi-autobiographical <em>Of
Human Bondage</em> (1915), which is usually considered his outstanding
achievement. The story follows the childhood, youth, and early manhood
of Philip Carey, who is born with a clubfoot. Philip never knew his
father and his mother only for a brief space. He is raised by a
religious aunt and uncle, but the real process of his education, after
the end of an unsatisfactory social life, begins in Heidelberg. Philip
goes to Paris to study art. Mildred Rogers, a waitress in a teashop,
becomes his great love,&nbsp;which nearly destroys him.&nbsp;Philip
neglects his studies, and gives Mildred gifts he cannot afford. "I
never liked you, not from the beginning, but you forced yourself on me,
I always hated it when you kissed me," she says&nbsp;after falling in
love with Philip's penniless friend, who eventually leaves her. Mildred
becomes a prostitute, Philip meets her again, she has contracted
veneral disease and he buys her medicine. At the age of thirty he
qualifies as a doctor, marries Sally Athelny, a normal, healthy, happy
girl, but is unable to forget his thirst for his "strange, desperate
thirst for that vile woman," Mildred. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Noteworthy, <em>Of Human Bondage</em>is one of the few classic
novels about a working-class mistress. Bette Davis, who played Mildred
in the film adaptation of the novel, said that when Maugham visited the
set of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Little Foxes</span>,
"it was difficult for me to realize that this mild-mannered man who had
such difficulty speaking had written all those great books." Graham
Greene wrote that her performance in the film was "wickedly good". <br>
 </p>

      <p>With
the outbreak of WW I, Maugham volunteered for the Red
Cross, and was stationed in France. Due to his medical qualification he
worked as an ambulance man. At the Western Front he met Gerald
Haxton (1892-1944), an American, who became his companion for the next
several decades. Disguising
himself as a reporter, Maugham served as a chief agent for British
Secret Intelligence Service in Saint Petersburg in 1916-17, but his
stuttering
and poor health hindered his career in this field. Moreover, he did not
speak Russian, and contributed to the failure of intelligence to
predict the course of the Russian revolution. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1917 Maugham married
Syrie Barnardo Wellcome, an interior decorator; they were divored in
1927-8. On his return from Russia, he spent a year in a sanatorium in
Scotland. Maugham then set off with Haxton on a series of travels to
eastern Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Mexico. In many novels the
surroundings also are international. Maugham's most famous story, which
became the play <em>Rain</em> and has been adapted for the screen
several times, was inspired by a missionary and prostitute among his
fellow passengers on a trip to Pago Pago. </p>

      <p><em>The Moon and the Sixpence</em> (1919) told of Charles
Strickland (or actually Paul Gauguin), an artist, whose rejection of
Western civilization led to his departure for Tahiti. There he is
blinded by leprosy but still continues painting. Maugham reused
elements of his Pacific diaries in <em>Trembling of a Leaf</em>
(1921), which included the story 'Rain.' It was made into a
stage production&nbsp;by John Colton and Clemence Randolph in 1922.</p>
      <p>In
1928 Maugham settled in Cape Ferrat in France. The villa Mauresque, in
which he made his home, had been built by the infamous King Leopold II
of Belgium. It was frequented by a number of artists and writers,
Christopher Isherwood, Don Bachardy, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Noël
Coward, Cecil Beaton, and others. Maugham's plays,
including <em>The Circle</em>&nbsp;(1921), a satire of social life, <em>Our
Betters</em>&nbsp;(1923), about Americans in Europe, and <em>The&nbsp;Constant
Wife</em>&nbsp;(1927), about a wife who takes revenge on her unfaithful
husband, were performed in Europe and in the United States. <em>Cakes and Ale</em>
(1930) was social satire on a famous novelist, Edward Driffield,
supposedly modelled on Thomas Hardy. "It was in vain that I denied it," complained Maugham&nbsp;<font size="-1"> ('For Maugham It's Cakes and Ale, <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times Book Review</span>, 19 March, 1950)</font>, who met the author only once, at a large dinner party at
Lady St Helier's in 1908. <br>
</p>
      <p>During
World War II Maugham lived in Hollywood, where he worked on the screen
adaptation of his novel <em>Razor's Edge</em>&nbsp;(1944). "This book
consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close
contact only at long intervals, and I have little knowledge of what
happened to him in between," Maugham said in the beginning. "I have
invented nothing." Maugham tells of a young American veteran who moves
through superbly described settings: Italy, London, the Riviera,
Montparnasse. He seeks in the end relief in India from the horrors of
war and gains a sense of being at one with the Absolute, through the
Indian philosophical system known as Vedanta. Maugham himself had in
1938 visited India, where fainted in an ashram, and met a holy man
named Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi. </p>

      <p>As an agent and writer Maugham was a link in the long
tradition from <a href="../../../marlowe.htm">Christopher Marlowe</a>,
Ben Johnson and Daniel Defoe to the modern day writers <a href="../../../greene.htm">Graham Greene</a>, John Le Carré, John
Dickson Carr, Alec Waugh and Ted Allbeury, who all have worked for the
secret service. It is said that the modern spy story began with
Maugham's <em>Ashenden; or, the British Agent</em> (1928), a
collection of six short stories set in Switzerland, France, Russia, and
Italy. It was partly based on the author's own experiences. The
protagonist, Ashenden, appeared also in <em>Cakes and Ale</em>
and <i>The Moon and the Sixpence</i>. Alfred Hitchcock used in <i>Secret
Agent </i>(1936) specifically the stories 'The Traitor' and 'The
Hairless Mexican.' In the film, set in Switzerland, an agents kill a
wrong man and then goes after the right one. A chocolate factory is
used by the crooks' as a headquarters. </p>
      <p>Maugham believed that there is a true harmony in the
contradictions of mankind and that the normal is in reality the
abnormal. "The ordinary is the writer's richest field," he stated in <em>The
Summing Up</em>&nbsp;(1938). In the satirical short story 'The Ant and the
Grasshopper' Maigham juxtaposed two brothers, the unscrupulous and
carefree Tom and the hardworking, respectable George, who expects that
Tom would end in the gutter. However, Tom marries a rich old woman, she
dies and leaves him a fortune. "I burst into a shout of laughter as I
looked at George's wrathful face. I rolled in my chair, I very nearly
fell in the floor. George never forgave me. But Tom often asks me to
excellent dinners in his charming house in Mayfair, and he occasionally
borrows a trifle from me, that is merely from force of habit." </p>
      <p>Although Maugham became world famous he was never knighted.
His relationship with Gerald Haxton, his secretary, prompted
speculations. After Haxton's death, he found a new companion, Alan
Searle, and wanted to adopt him as his son. While in Capri, Maugham
enjoyed the company of the homosexual and lesbian colony there. With
the homosexual esthete John Ellingham Brooks, and Edward Frederic
Benson he purchased shares of the Villa Cercole. Maugham's closest
woman friend was Barbara Nash Back, the wife of Dr. Ivor Back, who was
left penniless in 1951 after the death of her husband. In the 1960s,
Maugham began to suffer from demantia. To keep his personal life
hidden, Maugham burned much of his correspondence. His efforts to
disgrace his wife in <em>Looking Back</em>&nbsp;(1962)
caused a deep
rift between the author and his daughter Liza, later Lady Glendevon; he
denied that she was her daughter. The case went to court and she won
$1.4m. Maugham died in Nice on
December 16, 1965. It is said that as he lay dying he asked Sir Alfred
Ayer visit him and reassure him that there was no life after death. </p>
      <p>A number of Maugham's short stories have been filmed. <i>Quartet</i>
(1948) consists of four stories introduced by the author <font face="Symbol">-</font> 'The Facts of Life,' 'The Alien Corn,' 'The
Kite,' and 'The Colonel's Lady.' In 'The Kite' the protagonist,
Herbert, starts to fly kites with his parents in childhood. After
marriage Herbert continues his hobby, although his wife Betty considers
it childish. When Herbert wants to buy a new kite, Betty packs his bag
and Herbert returns to his parents' house; Betty smashes the kite. The
magistrate orders him to pay Betty alimony, twenty-five shillings a
week, but Herbert refuses to obey the order and chooses the prison. "It
may be that in some queer way he identifies himself with the kite
flying so free and so high above him, and it's as it were an escape
from the monotony of life. It may be that in some dim, confused way it
represents an ideal of freedom and adventure, And you know, when a man
once gets bitten with the virus of the ideal not all the King's doctors
and not all the King's surgeons can rid him of it." </p>
      <p>After the 1930s Maugham's reputation abroad was greater than
in England. Maugham once said, "Most people cannot see anything, but I
can se what is in front of my nose with extreme clearness; the greatest
writers can see through a brick wall. My vision is not so penetrating."
His literary experiences Maugham collected in <i>The Summing Up</i>,
which has been used as a guidebook for creative writing. His style has
not impressed everyone. "Maugham's overall debt to Conrad is so
evident," wrote Christopher Hitchens in his review of <span style="font-style: italic;">Somerset Maugham: A Life</span> by Jeffrey Meyers, "that one usually finishes by putting him down and picking up the real thing <font size="-1">(<span style="font-style: italic;">The Atlantic</span>, May 2004)</font>.<br>
</p>
      <p>Interest in Maugham revived again in his 80th birthday, which
he celebrated by the special republication of<i> Cakes and Ale</i>, a
novel satirizing London literary circles and "Grand Old Men." Maugham
portrayed himself as Ashenden, Thomas Hardy was Driffield, and Hugh
Walpole was Kear. Barbara Belford listed in <i>Violet: The Story of
the Irrepressible Violet Hunt and Her Circle of Lovers and Friends </i>(1990)
Maugham among the lovers of Violet Hunt, along with such names as H. G.
Wells and Ford Madox Ford. The novelist Hugh Walpole portrayed Maugham
as the arrogant pessimist in <i>John Cornelius</i> (1937), he appeared
as John-Blair-Kennedy in Noël Coward's <i>South Sea Bubble</i> (1956),
Leverson Hurle in <i>Gin and Bitters</i> by A Riposte, the homosexual
novelist in Coward's <i>Point Valaine</i> (1935), Kenneth Marchal
Toomey in Anthony Burgess <i>Earthly Powers</i> (1980), Willie Tower
in S.N. Behrman's <i>Jane</i> (1946), and Gilbert Hereford Vaughn in
Ada Leverson's<i> The Limit</i> (1911). </p>
