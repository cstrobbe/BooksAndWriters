<p>American writer, known for his 1066 pages long historical novel,<i> Raintree County</i>
(1948). It was the only book Ross Lockridge Jr. wrote. Two months after
its publication by Houghton Mifflin, Lockridge committed suicide. He
left no suicide note. The novel was an immediate bestseller and was
later made into a major film in the tradition of Civil war romance.
Although <i>Raintree County</i> is seldom read today, it is
nevertheless a true classic in the sense that a "classic has never
finished saying what it as to say" (Italo Calvino).
</p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Lockridge had allowed his book to become
so all-important that when it passed out of his hands at publication,
its disappearance threatened his life. No one warned him that the job
of the writer is to ignore the book that's been done and buckle down to
the next one."</b> (James A Michener in </font><i><font size="2">The World Is My Home: A Memoir,</font></i><font size="2"> 1992)</font></blockquote>

<p>Ross Franklin Lockridge, Jr. was born in Bloomington, Indiana. His
father, also called Ross Franklin, was a writer and teacher, who
published histories of Indiana, including <i>The Old Fauntleroy Home</i> (1939) and <i>The Labyrinth</i>
(1941). Ross was the youngest of four children. His eldest brother,
Bruce, who had been the hope of the family, drowned in the St. Joseph
River. Lockridge, with drive and ambition, also excelled at everything
he did. He was an athlete and his academic career was distinguished. In
1931 he entered Indiana University, and after studying a year at the
Sorbonne in Paris, he graduated with BA in 1935 from Indiana
University. Remaining there, he taught English while completing his
master's degree. In 1937 Lockridge married Vernice Baker, his high
school sweetheart; they had four children. </p>
<p>Lockridge earned his M.A. in 1939. Next year he was awarded a
fellowship at Harvard, where he planned to write a dissertation on Walt
Whitman. However, he spent more time with his four-hundred-page epic
poem of American life, <i>The Dream of the Flesh of Iron</i>. After it
was rejected by publishers, he turned his energy to another idea, a
historical novel of nineteenth-century Indiana, partly based on his
mother's family, the Shockleys. At that time he had adandoned his
studies. To support his family, he taught from 1941 to 1946 at Simmons
College, in Boston, Massachusetts. During the war, Lockridge did not
serve in the army - he was 4-F, physically unqualified, due to
irregularity of his heartbeat. </p>

<p>Laboring with "the great American novel", which was Lockridge's
ultimate goal, took seven years. Lockridge produced feverishly twenty
to thirty pages, which he then revised or alternatively threw into the
waste-paper basket. His wife helped him in retyping, but Lockridge
himself was also Indiana's state champion in speed typing - a skill
which he already had learned at high school. </p>

<p>While <i>Raintree County</i> was being written, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
announced a literary competition for a novel that could be made into a
movie. The prize was $100,000 plus bonuses. Lockridge won the prize
prior the publication of his book, but later he sent Louis B. Mayer,
the legendary head of MGM, a letter in which he doubted Mayer's skills
as a filmmaker. After Lockridge's campaign, <i>Life</i> magazine printed an excerpt of the novel and introduced the author in a pictorial essay. Book-of-the-Month-Club chose <i>Raintree County</i> as its main selection for January 1948. </p>

<p>In spite of its massive size and unconventional narrative technique, <i>Raintree County</i> was a commercial success in 1948, competing on the <b> </b>national bestseller list with Norman Mailer's <i>The Naked and the Dead</i>, Irwin Shaw's <i>The Young Lions</i>, and Alfred Kinsey's <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>. Lockridge's book was also translated into several languages, among others into Swedish and Finnish. </p>


<p>First reactions to the novel were positive; it was called a
masterpiecen and Lockridge was compared to Thomas Wolfe. Among the
negative reviews was James Baldwin's 'Lockridge. In 'The American
Myth'', published in <i>New Leader</i> <font size="2">(April 10, 1948)</font>.
Baldwin spitefully remarked that during "his lifetime Ross Lockridge,
Jr., came across a great many words and in Raintree County he has set
down every one of them." </p>

<p>Suffering from depression, Lockridge was unable to start a new book
in the middle of his sudden success. On March 6, 1948, Lockeridge
asphyxiated himself in the garage of his new home in Bloomington. He
was thirty-four. It was the ultimate sacrifice for his work. "He lived
seven years with that story. It sapped his very heart's blood," his
mother, Elsie Lockridge said. Ross Lockridge was buried in Rose Hill
cemetery. <i>Raintree County</i><i></i> did not have the profound
impact on the literary scene he had anticipated. However, the theme of
restored oneness found similar, emotionally intense and nostalgic
interpretation nine years later in Ray Bradbury's famous early novel <i>Dandelion Wine</i> (1957). </p>
<p>Lockridge's <i>magnum opus, </i>which openly idealized the role of
literature, was an answer to nihilistic arguments of the death of the
novel and cynical mood of the realistic school. Like the world of
Twain's Huck Finn, Lockridge's imaginary county, partly modelled after
Henry County, Indiana, is more than it is &#8211; an opposite to the
commonplace or "phony" world of Holden Caulfield, also in debt to
Twain. Following the example of <a href="/jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a> in <i>Ulysses</i>,
Lockridge described one day in his hero's life &#8211; in this case July 4,
1892, the nation's Independence Day. Lockridge, who acknowleded the
influence of number of writers, Joyce and Thomas Mann included, himself
saw that his book was much more readable than <i>Ulysses</i>. </p>

<p>In a way, <i>Raintree County</i> is a dream inside a dream. The
Gnostic Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who loved Shakespeare and
Walt Whitman more than his contemporary Latin American colleagues,
would have recognized Lockeridge's position with sympathy. The
protagonist is John Wickliff Shawnessy, an aspiring poet, who only
daydreams of writing a great book which would re-create a new American
canon &#8211; actually meaning the work in hand, created by Lockridge.
Lockridge's self-absorbed scope also became a target of Baldwin's
criticism. "Americans passionately believe in their avowed ideals,
amorphous as they are, and are terrified of waking from a radiant
dream," he summarized in his review. "Raintree County is a kind of
ultimate defense of the dreaming and the dream." </p>

<p>Through series of flashbacks, Lockridge highlights crucial events
Shawnessy's life, setting his great expectations and marriage problems
against the story of the nation. Shawnessy's mission in life is
illuminated by poetic prose, full of vision, beauty, and Midwestern
light. At the center of the labyrinth of meanings is the biblical myth
of the Garden of Eden and Shawnessy's search for the secret of the
mythical raintree. </p>

<p>As the raintree is the symbol of the tree of life, the major
characters have their mythical doubles and alter egos. Shawnessy's
somewhat Mephistotelian alter ego is Professor Jerusalem Webster
Stiles, an educator who recognizes Shawnessy's talent and with whom he
also shares identical initials. Shawnessy's first great love is Nell
Gaither, his blonde river nymph, but he marries Susannah Drake, a
Southern belle from a slave holder family, scarred physically and
emotionally. Susannah's obsession with her racial identity and &#8220;purity
of blood&#8221; eventually drives her insane. From the Civil War Shawnessy
returns like Lazarus, seeing his name on a tombstone. Shawnessy's
odyssey follows the conventions of <i>Bildungsroman</i>, he has lost
his youthful idealism. The beginning of the novel reveals that he has
settled down to prosaic bourgeois existence with wife and job, but the
last pages confirm that Shawnessy's capacity to dream, his strong
restorative source, is not dashed. </p>

<p>For Edward Dmyrtyk's film version of <i>Raintree Country</i> (1957),
starring Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift, MGM budgeted $5
million, a lot of money at that time. In the studio in Culver City an
entire sound stage was reserved for the scene depicting General William
T. Sherman's march into Atlanta. Taylor and Clift thought the movie
would not be better than <i>A Place in The Sun</i> (1951), in which they had worked together and which received six Oscars. MGM had higher hopes, that it would be a Northern <i><a href="/mmitchel.htm">Gone With the Wind</a></i>. </p>

<p>The script, written by Millard Kaufman, did not satisfy Clift and he
wanted to make several changes to it. "I agreed to listen to his
suggestions," said Dmytryk later. "He was obviously a great actor -
very inventive." About half of the film was shot when Clift had a near
fatal car accident which shattered his face. Because his right profile
was not so damaged, the production continued. Also Taylor's health
broke down several times and she suffered from a very tight corset. In
spite of bad reviews, <i>Raintree County</i> received four Academy Award nominations (best
actress, best art direction-set decoration, best score, best costume
design), but won no Oscars. In 1999 the film was reissued on video with
15 m. additional footage. The soaring, romantic music was composed by
John Green. Nat King Cole sang the title track, which became a hit. </p>
