<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American writer and cartoonist, who dealt
with the frustrations of modern world. Thurber's best-known characters
are Walter Mitty, his snarling wife, and silently observing animals.
His stories have influenced later writers, such as <a href="vonnegut.htm">Kurt Vonnegut</a> and <a href="heller.htm">Joseph Heller</a>. Thurber is generally acknowledged as the greatest American humorist since Mark Twain (1835-1910). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"What was the matter with that one
policeman? mother asked, after they had gone. "Grandfather shot him," I
said. "What for?" she demanded. I told her he was a deserter. "Of all
things!" said mother. "He was such a nice-looking young man."'</b> (from 'The Night the Ghost Got In', in </font><i><font size="2">My Life and Hard Times</font></i><font size="2">, 1933) </font></blockquote>
<p>James Thurber was born in Columbus, Ohio. His father, Charles L.
Thurber, was a clerk and minor politician, who went through many
periods of unemployment. Mary Thurber, his mother, was a strong-minded
woman and a practical joker. Once she surprised her guests by
explaining that she was kept in the attic because of her love for the
postman. On another occasion she pretended to be a cripple and attended
a faith healer's revival, jumping up suddenly and proclaiming herself
cured. Thurber described her as "a born comedienne" and "one of the
finest comic talents I think I've ever known." Thurber's father, who
had dreams of being an actor or lawyer, was said to have been the basis
of the typical small, slight man of Thurber's stories. Later Thurber
portrayed his family in <span style="font-style: italic;">My Life and Hard Times</span>
(1933). "I suppose that the high-water mark of my youth in Columbus,
Ohio, was the night the bed fell on my father," Thurber wrote in the
book. </p>
<p>Thurber was partially blinded by a childhood accident &#8211; his brother
William shot an arrow at him. When he was unable to participate in
games and sports with other children, he developed a rich fantasy life,
which found its outlet in his writings. </p>

<p>Thurber began writing at secondary school. Due to his poor eyesight,
he did not serve in WW I, but studied between 1913 and 1918 at Ohio
State University. He worked as a code clerk in Washington, DC, and at
the US embassy in Paris. In the early 1920s he worked as a journalist
for several newspapers. He also lived in Paris, writing for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. </p>
      <p>In 1926 Thurber went to New York City. For a period he worked as a reporter for the 
<i>Evening Post</i>, and then joined Harold Ross's newly established <i>The New Yorker</i>,
where he found his clear, concise prose style. "Everybody thinks he
knows English," Ross said to Thurber, "but nobody does. I think it's
because of the goddam women and schoolteachers." Later Thurber
published his memoirs from this period under the title <span style="font-style: italic;">The Years with Ross </span>(1959).
Originally Ross hired Thurber to be his "Jesus," (a corruption of
"genius"), who would make the magazine to work, but during the years he
hired one Jesus after another, who never quite managed to deliver what
they were supposed to. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Thurber was married twice, and had one daughter. He married in 1922 Althea Adams, the daughter of an army doctor;
her mother was a faculty member of the Home Economics Department at
Ohio State. She was a striking woman, a dominating personality with
strong intellectual and artistic interests. The marriage was unhappy
and ended in divorce in 1935. Althea filed divorce papers in
Connecticut, on the grounds of "intolerable cruelty." She received the
house in Sandy Hook, custody of their daughter Rosemary, life insurance
policies, alimony until she remarried and the first year's profits from
      <span style="font-style: italic;">My Life and Hard Times</span>. After divorce Thurber met Hele Wismer, a magazine editor, 
in the Algonquin Hotel lobby in New York; they were married one month
later. She got his finances in order, dressed him well, and became a
friend to Rosemary, and Althea, too. "Of the twenty-six years they were
together," wrote Harrison Kinney, "Thurber was legally blind through
twenty-one of them, and that he kept going as long and as well as he
did may be credited in large part to Helen's care and her commitment to
the partnership."&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thurber's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Is Sex Necessary?</span>, came out in 1929. It was jointly written with the fellow <i>New Yorker</i>
staffer E.B. White. The book presented Thurber's drawings on the
subject, and instantly established him as a true comic talent. Thurber
made fun of European psychoanalysis, including Freud's work, and
theorists who had been attempting to reduce sex to a scientifically
understandable level. In 'The Nature of the American Male: A Study of
Pedestalism' Thurber claimed that "in no other civilized nation are the
biological aspects of love so distorted and transcended by emphasis
upon its sacredness as they are in the United States of America."
According to Thurber, baseball, prize-fighting, horse-racing,
bicycling, and bowling have acted as substitutes for sex. The female
developed and perfected the "Diversion Subterfuge" to put Man in his
place. "Its first manifestation was fudge-making." </p>
<p>In the 1950s Thurber published modern fairy tales for children, <span style="font-style: italic;">The 13 Clocks</span> (1950) and<span style="font-style: italic;"> 
The Wonderful O</span> (1957), which both were hugely successful. Thurber's children's tales display 
a cynical undercurrent, and show at times a great deal of bitterness. 
<a href="capote.htm"> Truman Capote</a> also worked at the <i>New Yorker</i>,
but according to his reminiscences he was a general dogsbody, who
helped Thurber to and from meetings, or escorted Thurber to his trysts
with one of the magazine's secretaries. Thurber had already in 1933
left <i>The New Yorker</i> staff, but remained still its contributor.
His eyesight became worse in the 1940s, and by the 1950s his blindness
was nearly total. Thurber continued to compose stories in his head, and
he played himself in 88 performances of the play <i>A Thurber Carnival</i>.
He received a Litt.D. in 1950 from Kenyon College, one from Yale in
1953, and an L.H.D. (honorary) from Williams College in 1951. </p>
<p>In later years he lived with his wife 
at West Cornwall, Connecticut. 
He suffered from alcoholism and depression, but Helen's devoted 
nursing enabled him to maintain his literary production. His drinking companions included the actor 
Humphrey Bogart, who read more widely than just the scripts. Bogart had Thurber's 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze</span> on his bookshelf and cartoon "Jolly Times" on 
the wall in his Hollywood home.  
In 1958 the editors of <i>Punch</i> magazine gave a luncheon in Thurber's honor. James Thurber died of a blood clot on the brain on November 2, 1961, in New York.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"One night nearly thirty years ago, in a
legendary New York boîte de nuit et des arts called Tony's, I was
taking part in a running literary gun fight that had begun with a
derogatory or complimentary remark somebody made about something, when
one of the participants, former Pinkerton man Dashiell Hammett, whose <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>
had come out a couple of years before, suddenly startled us all by
announcing that his writing had been influenced by Henry James's novel <i>The Wings of the Dove</i>.
Nothing surprises me any more, but I couldn't have been more surprised
than if Humphrey Bogart, another frequenter of that old salon of
wassail and debate, had proclaimed that his acting bore deep impress of
the histrionic art of Maude Adams." </b>(from 'The Wings of Henry James', in </font><i><font size="2"><i>Lanterns and Lances</i></font></i><font size="2">, 1961) </font></blockquote>

<p>During his career Thurber experimented with many types of writing.
He said that his ideas were influenced by the Mid-western atmosphere of
Columbus, movies, and comic strips. Thurber's wry humor showed great
sensitivity to human fears and follies. His observations had often a
timeless, aphoristic quality. "Early to rise and early to bed makes a
male healthy and wealthy and dead," he said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Fables for Our Time</span>
(1940). His poor eyesight was several times the source of surrealistic
misunderstandings, which found their way into his writings. "The
kingdom of the partly blind is little like Oz, a little like
Wonderland," he wrote. "Anything you can think of, and a lot you would
never think of, can happen there." Thurber also was inspired by
confusion with language as in the story 'The Black Magic of Barney
Haller' (1935), where his handyman Haller's linguistic innovations
startle him more than the thunder. "Humour is emotional chaos
remembered in tranquillity," he once said. Thurber's misogynist theme
of war between men and women has been criticized by his feminist
readers. </p>
<p>Thurber's story 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' was taken up by psychologist. 'Walter 
Mitty Syndrome' was put forward in a British medical journal as a clinical condition, which 
manifested itself in compulsive fantasizing. The title character is a meek, mild-mannered 
husband, who escapes his everyday existence in heroic fantasies. "Does it ever occur 
to you that I am sometimes thinking?" he says to Mrs. Mitty. "I'm going to take 
your temperature when I get you home," she says. The character inspired Danny Kaye's 
movie of 1947, in which Boris Karloff played Dr. Hugo Hollingshead, a psychiatrist. 

</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Male Animal </span>(1939), a
satire of athlete worship, was written with Elliott Nugent, who
featured in the 1940 Broadway play as a jealous college professor,
whose wife is warming up to an old football star. The play co-starred
Gene Tierney, Leon Ames, and Don DeFore. In the film adaption from 1942
Henry Fonda played the role. A musical version, produced by Warner
Bros. and directed by H. Bruce Humberstone, was made in 1952, starring
Ronald Reagan as the professor and Virginia Mayo as a stripper who
aspires to become a writer. Thurber's short pieces have been adapted
more than dozen times for TV.</p>
<p>In addition to his fame as writer, Thurber was a highly respected artist and cartoonist 
as well. His surreal, minimalist sketches were regular features of the<i> New Yorker</i>,
where they became prototypes of the sophisticated cartoons. Thurber did
not consider himself an artist, but his "non-mastery of line" has been
compared to that of Matisse. Thurber was also a passionate letter
writer. A collection of his letters, edited by Harrison Kinney and
Rosemary A. Thurber, was published in 2003. </p>
