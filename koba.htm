<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->Eighteenth-century Japanese poet, who used
the simple pen name Issa and who is propably the best loved of the <i>haiku
      </i>masters. Issa's life was full of misfortunes &#8211; he lost his
mother at an early age, his stepmother mistreated him, he suffered from
poverty, his children died, and his marriage with his second wife was
unhappy. However, Issa's poems reflected the small joys of life. He
used also dialect and colloquial language when depicting the life of
the Shinshu peasants and everyday events.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Quiet </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">In the depths of the lake </font><br>
        <font size="2">A peak of cloud. </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>As a poet Issa was more robust and subjective compared to
austere, priestly Matsuo Basho (1644-94) and worldly, sophisticated
Yosa Buson (1716-83). By confessing his doubts and loneliness in highly
personal <i>haiku</i>, Issa's poems also have given consolation to
generations of readers. One of the poems in <span style="font-style: italic;">Oraga haru</span> (The Spring of
My Life), completed in 1819, is said to have been written by Issa when
he was a child: "Come with me and play / Parentless sparrow". </p>
      <p>Kobayashi Issa was born Kobayashi Yatar in Kashiwabara,
Shinano province (now part of Shinano Town, Nagano Prefecture), a son
of a farmer. Yagobei, his father, was thirty years old and was widowed
in 1765, a few years after Issa was born. He owned two acres of
farmland, a hard working man burdened with heavy taxes. The two
brothers of Issa's mother, named Kuni, were well educated, one was a
priest and the other a poet. Until his father remarried, Issa was
looked after by his grandmother, Kana, who may have spoiled him a
little bit. Issa learned to read and write at the house of Rokuzaemon
Nakamura, know as a poet under the pen name Shimpo and who had a
flourishing wholesale business in wine. Kana died in 1776 and Issa was
then sent to Edo, where he felt like being "a pitiful bird without a
nest."</p>
      <p>Issa's troubles with his stepmother, named Hatsu, began when
she gave birth to her
own son, Senroku. Issa had to babysit his little brother, his skin wet
with Senroku's urine. Issa also complained that he was beaten "a
hundred times a day", every time Senroku fretted. In 1777, at the age
of fourteen, he was sent by his father to Edo (Tokyo today), where he
studied <i>haiku</i> under the master Norokuan Chikua (died 1790).
Possibly Issa also worked as a clerk at a Buddhist temple. There are no
reliable record of these years. After Chikua's death Issa succeeded him
as a teacher. In 1790 Issa got at least nine poems published in five
different books. </p>
      <p>Issa's works gained the attention Seibi Natsume, a wealthy
rice merchant, who became his patron. Although his poems became more
and more known, he was forced to travel and work hard until his
fiftieth year. "Days and months are travelers of eternity", he later
said. "So are the years that pass by." He called himself "Issa the
monk" or "Issa the Beggar", had his head shaven and wore a dark robe.
In 1792 he gave up the name Yataro and changed it into Issa, Haikai-ji
Nyudo Issa-bo (Temple of Haiku Lay Brother Issa); Issa means One Cup of
Tea. In one poem he explained: "With spring's arrival, / Yataro becomes
reborn / as Issabo". His earlier names included "Kobayashi Ikyo" and
"Nirokuan Kikumei." After a journey in south-western Japan, he
published a collection of verse, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tabishui</span> (1795). Issa lived at various
places, including Kyoto, Osaka, Nagasaki, Matsuyama and other cities.
He often also visited his home town. While in Endo he lived the life of
a haikai master and taught amateur poets. In eastern haikai circles his
work did not enjoy much of a reputation. During these years his
spiritual guide was Basho's <i>Narrow Road to the Interior</i>. </p>
      <p>Yagobei died of typhoid fever in 1801, at the age of 65. The
body was cremated according to the Buddhist rites and Issa collected
the bones. His sorrow Issa recorded in a short journal, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chichi no sh&#363;en nikki </span>(1801).
Issa's stepmother and stepbrother challenged his father's will, but
finally, after 13-year-long disputes, the property, including the
house, was equally divided between Issa and his stepbrother Senroku. In
the early 1810s Issa returned to Kashiwabara. At the age of fifty-one,
he married a young woman, named Kiku, and was able to enjoy the
position of the leader of the <i>haiku</i> world in northern Shinano.
In <i>Diary of the Death of My Father</i> the poet depicts the family
disputes before his father's death &#8211; he died of typhoid fever. Even
though the sick man was suffering he "smiled happily at the people who
offered him poison and thought ill of anyone who tried to force
medicine on him." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>So this is where </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">I end up living </font></b><font size="-1">&#8211;</font><b><font size="2"> </font><br>
        <font size="2">Five feet of snow. </font><br>
        <font size="2">Where I come from </font><br>
        <font size="2">Even flies </font><br>
        <font size="2">Bite. </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>Issa was a prolific writer of both poetry and prose. He
treated his subjects with humor, excelling particularly at affectionate
portrayals of such creatures as fleas, frogs and sparrows. Issa's poems
about animals and insects are learned by every schoolchild in Japan. He
is the most popular haikai poet of the Endo period. During his lifetime
Issa wrote over 20,000 <i>haiku</i>, hundreds of <i>tanka</i>, and
several works of <i>baibun</i>. Close observations of nature and
passing but meaningful personal incidents have often melancholic mood.
In poems based on his own life Issa often used words of the daily
conversations. Village life is not seen as idyllic, but hard,
especially during the winter: "Cold cold / In the eaves / Evening
cidadas and red peppers." </p>
      <p>Among Issa's other famous works is <i>Ora ga haru</i> (1819, tr. The Year of My Life / The Spring of
My Life), a poetic diary, where he records his life and his spiritual
path, sad memories, the death of his beloved daughter, Sato, but also
contemplates the cycles of nature: "But this poor tree has neither the
strength to put forth fruits and flowers, nor the good fortune quite to
die. Existence is a continuous struggle to remain simply one foot
high." <i>The Year of My Life</i> was written during the relatively
calm period in the poet's life. However, Issa's later years were filled
with sorrows, when his wife and eight children died and his property
was destroyed by fire. Issa himself suffered from failing healt.
Temporarily, he lost his ability to speak. Issa's new wife, Yuki, came
from a local samurai family. She was 38 years old. After a few weeks of
marriage, Yuki left him. In 1826 Issa married for a third time; she was
a farmer's daughter, who had worked at a local inn. It was a doomed
union. Issa died two years later, on November 19, 1827 in Kashiwabara
(in some sources the date is January 5,1827), survived by his wife and
unborn child. </p>
