      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English author and illustrator of
picture-books for very young,&nbsp; whose&nbsp;many
characters&nbsp;include Peter Rabbit, Jeremy Fisher, Jemima
Puddle-Duck, and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Beatrix Potter's popularity has
shown no sign of diminishing since she created&nbsp;her timeless
children's books. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Once upon a time there were four
little Rabbits, and their names were - Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and
Peter. They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root
of a very big tree"</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Tale of
Peter Rabbit</font></i><font size="2">, 1902) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Beatrix Potter was born in 2 Bolton Gardens, South Kensington,
London, the only daughter of Rupert Potter, a wealthy <i>rentier</i>,
and Helen Potter, whose sister Elizabeth Leech had married Rupert's
younger brother Walter.&nbsp;The property of the family came from the
Lancashire cotton industry. Rupert's friends included
the&nbsp;photographer A. F. Mackenzie and the&nbsp;Pre-Raphaelite
painter Sir John Everett Millais, who frequently teased the shy
Beatrix. </p>
      <p>Potter spent a sheltered childhood with her brother Bertram,
who was five years younger. Her mother, afraid of germs, did not allow
her children&nbsp;to mix with other children than members of the
family.&nbsp;Potter amused herself by painting, using specimens from
the Natural History Museum or sketching the nature in the Lake
District, where the family spent summer holidays. She also became a
proficient photographer. Her pets included at various times, rabbits,
&nbsp;a green frog called Punch, lizards,&nbsp;water newts, a tortoise,
salamanders, mice, several bats, birds, guinea pigs, and other animals.</p>
      <p>Potter lived in Bolton Gardens with her parenst for nearly
fifty years, before she moved north to settle in the Lake District. Her
secluded London home&nbsp; Potter&nbsp;later described as "my unloved
birthplace".&nbsp;The daily rituals followed a schedule&nbsp;set by
Helen. Rupert spent usually his afternoon at a club. During World War
II, the house was destroyed in the air raids. Potter had more pleasant
recollections of the home of her grandparents, Camfield Place near
Hatfield in Hertfordshire. After her grandmother's death she wrote a
short essay, 'Memories of Camfield Place', to an imaginary
correspondent called Esther. </p>
      <p>Potter never went to school, but was taught at home by a
governess. She learned to read from Sir Walter Scott's novels and Maria
Edgeworth's <em>Tales</em>. Her favorites&nbsp;included <em>Aesop's
Fables</em>, fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian
Andersen, Harriet Beecher Stowe's <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>,&nbsp;
Charles Kingsley's fantasy&nbsp;<em>The Water-Babies, </em>and Lewis
Carroll's <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>. For her tenth
birthday she received from her father Beatrix Jemina Blackburn's <em>Birds
Drawn from Nature</em> (1868)
. "I kept it in the drawing room cupboard, only to be taken out after I
had washed my grimy little hands ..."&nbsp;Potter recalled.</p>
      <p>From the age of fifteen until&nbsp;she was past
thirty,&nbsp;Potter recorded her everyday life in her own secret
code-writing. "Thank goodness, my education was neglected," Potter
later&nbsp;said in an article, but actually she was interested in
science and spent much time in developing a theory of the germination
of fungus spores. In 1881, she received an Art Student's Certificate
from the Science and Art Departmrent of the Committee of Council on
Education. </p>
      <p>Potter began to draw and paint already young, but as a writer
and artist&nbsp;she made her debut in the 1890s, when she send to a
sick child illustrated animal stories, which found their way to the
publisher (Frederick Warne &amp; Company) and made her famous. In 1890
she published under the signature H. B. P. a small book of animal
drawings,<em> A Happy Pair</em>, which was accompanied verses by the
English songwriter and lawyer Fredric Weatherley (1848-1929)&nbsp;&#8211; he
wrote the songs 'Danny Boy' and 'Roses&nbsp;in Picardy'.</p>
      <p>In 1893 Potter wrote a letter to a young friend, Noël Moore,
the five-year-old son of a former governess. The text was illustrated
with drawings of animals and contained the first version of <em>The
Tale of Peter&nbsp; Rabbit</em>,&nbsp;the high-spirited bunny, who has
an insatiable hunger for carrot and cabbage. Peter's father was baked into a pie by Mr. Gregor. Also some other charartes,
such as Squirrel Nutkin, first appeared in Potter's letters. The little
book was privately printed in 1901 in an edition of 250 copies, and
then published by Frederick Warne &amp; Co; the company had first
rejected it. Potter and one of the publishers, Norman Warne, engaged in
1905, but he died of leukemia only a month later. Potter turned back to
her books as the one creative impulse left to her.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"If it were not impertinent to
lecture one's publisher&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> you are a great deal
too much afraid of the public, for whom I have never cared one tuppenny
button. I am </strong><strong><i>sure </i>that it is that attitude of
mind which has enabled me to keep up the series. Most people, after one
success, are so cringingly afraid of doing less well that they rub all
the edge off their subsequent work."</strong> (from <i>The Magic Years
of Beatrix Potter </i>by Margaret Lane, 1978) </font>
      </blockquote>
      <p>With the royalties from her books, Potter bought Hill Top,
a&nbsp; seventeeth-century farm&nbsp;at Sawrey in the Lake District,
paying nearly twice as much for the thirty-four-acre property as the
previous owner. "My purchase seems to be regarded as a huge joke," she
wrote to Harold Warne, her editor, but actually&nbsp;she made an
investment in personal freedom and independence. The following years
until 1913 were Potter's most productive. She published a number of
children's books with watercolor illustrations, and oversaw the
production and design. "I never quite understood the secret of Peter's perennial charm," Potter once admitted in a letter. By the time of her death, she had built up an
estate of 4.000 acres. In her business dealings, Potter was also rigorous. Her work created an entire industry around
them: pottery, tea-towels, soft toys, cartoon films.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Potter's&nbsp;
illustrations usually showed animal characters wearing human clothes,
but otherwise&nbsp;she treated her characters, human and animal,
without too much sentimentality. Betsy, the fisherman's wife from <em>The
Tale of Little Pig Robinson</em> (1930), has rheumatics, and Peter
Rabbit is nearly caught by Mr. McGregor, who chases the frightened
rabbit determinedly. It was important for her to write the stories both
simple and direct. When an attempt to issue <em>The Tale of the Pie
and the Patty Pan</em> (1905) and <em>The Roly-Poly Pudding</em>&nbsp;
(1908) in a larger format did not gain success, the original small
format of the book was found best and suitable for small hands. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>LITTLE Benjamin said, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">
"It spoils people's clothes </font><br>
        <font size="2">
to squeeze under a gate; </font><br>
        <font size="2">
the proper way to get in, </font><br>
        <font size="2">
is to climb down a pear tree." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">
(from 'The Tale of Benjamin Bunny'</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>At the age of 47 Potter married the solicitor William Heelis
and gradually stopped writing. He had acted for her in the purchase of
Castle Farm; the purchase had been made through W. Heelis and Sons, an
old-established family business. On her father's death, she received a
substantial inheritance and in 1923 she bought a sheep farm, where she
spent her last 30 years raising Herdwick sheep. In the Lake District,
she was better known as Mrs. William Heelis. <br>
 </p>
      <p>Potter's marriage was happy. She continued the life she loved
best&nbsp;&#8211; as&nbsp;a conservationist, landowner, solicitor's wife, and
farmer. A few years before&nbsp;Potter died,&nbsp;she wrote in a letter
to a friend, that "I am exceedingly sorry for my husband. You may have
noticed I am the stronger half of the pair..." Potter told her husband
little about her life before her marriage.&nbsp;
Her literary work deteriorated with her eyesight after 1918,
diminishing gradually by 1930s. <i>Tale of Little Pig Robinson</i> was
the only story of note to appear in her declining years. <em>The Fairy
Caravan</em> (1929),&nbsp;written for American publication only, did
not appear in England until 1952. </p>
      <p>Potter died in Sawrey, Lancashire on December 22, 1943. She
was cremated in Blackpool and her ashes were scattered somewhere on the
fells above Near Sawrey.&nbsp;Potter's home in the Lake District is
open to the public.&nbsp;She left several thousand acres
of land, including Hill Top Farm, the setting of several of her books,
to the National Trust.&nbsp;Her journal, which she kept from the age of
fifteen and which was written in&nbsp;minuscule handwriting
and&nbsp;elaborated code, was deciphered by Leslie Linder and published
in 1964. From 1992 to 1995 an animated series based on Potter's
characters was broadcasted every Christmas and Easter around the world.
