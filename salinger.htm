<P>J.D. Salinger's best-known work is <EM>The Catcher in the Rye</EM> (1951), a story about a rebellious teenage schoolboy and his quixotic experiences in New York. After gaining international fame with this novel, Salinger spent the rest of his life avoiding publicity. Though Salinger served in the U.S. Army in World War II and participated in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, 1944, only a few of his stories dealt directly or indirectly with the war. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though."</B> (Holden Caulfied in </FONT><I><FONT size=2>The Catcher in the Rye</FONT></I><FONT size=2>) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Jerome David Salinger was born and grew up in the fashionable apartment district of Manhattan, New York. He was the son of Solomon Salinger, a prosperous Jewish importer of Kosher cheese, and Miriam, n&eacute;e Marie Jillich, his Scotch-Irish wife. In his childhood the young Jerome was called Sonny. The family had a beautiful apartment on Park Avenue. After restless studies in prep schools, he was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy (1934-36), which he attended briefly. His friends from this period remember his sarcastic wit. In 1937 when he was eighteen and nineteen, Salinger spent five months in Europe. From 1937 to 1938 he studied at Ursinus College and New York University. He fell in love with Oona O'Neill, wrote her letters almost daily, and was later shocked when she married Charles Chaplin, who was much older than she. </P>
<P>In 1939 Salinger took a class in short story writing at Columbia University under Whit Burnett, founder-editor of the <I>Story Magazine</I>. His first published story, entitled 'The Young Folks' appeared in the magazine when he was 21. During World War II he was drafted into the infantry and was involved in the invasion of Normandy, landing on Utah Beach on D-Day. Salinger's comrades considered him very brave, a genuine hero. While in Europe Salinger managed to write stories and meet Ernest Hemingway at the Ritz bar in Paris. He also fought in one of the bloodiest episodes of the war in H&uuml;rtgenwald, a useless battle, where over one fifth of the original regimental soldiers were left. Shortly after the Battle of Bulge, Salinger participated in the liberation of Dachau. </P>
<P>In his celebrated story 'For Esm&eacute; – With Love and Squalor' Salinger depicted a fatigued American soldier. He starts a correspondence with 
a thirteen-year-old British girl, which helps him to get a grip of life again. Salinger himself was hospitalized for stress in 1945. After serving in the Army Signal Corps and Counter-Intelligence Corps. 
He played poker with other aspiring writers, but was considered a sour character who won all the time. He considered Hemingway and Steinbeck 
second rate writers but praised Melville. In 1945 Salinger married a French woman named Sylvia – she was a doctor. They were later divorced and in 1955 Salinger married Claire Douglas, the daughter of the British art critic Robert Langton Douglas. The marriage ended in divorce in 1967, when Salinger's retreat into his private world and Zen Buddhism only increased. </P>
<P>Salinger's early short stories appeared in such magazines as<I> Story</I>, 
<I>Saturday Evening Post</I> and <I>Esquire</I>, and then in the <I>New Yorker</I>, which published almost all of his later texts. 
'Slight Rebellion off Madison' (1946), narrated in the third person, marked the appearance of Holden Morrisey Caulfield. 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish' (1948) introduced Seymour Glass, who commits suicide with a pistol. It was the earliest reference 
to the Glass family, whose stories would go on to form the main corpus of his writing. The 'Glass cycle' continued in the collections 
<EM>Franny and Zooey</EM> (1961), Raise <EM>High the Roof Beam, Carpenters</EM> (1963) and <EM>Seymour: An Introduction</EM> (1963). Several of the stories are 
narrated by Buddy Glass. 'Hapworth 16, 1924' is written in the form of a letter from summer camp, in which the seven-year-old Seymour 
draws a portrait of him and his younger brother Buddy. "When I look back, listen back, over the half-dozen or slightly more original 
poets we've had in America, as well as the numerous talented eccentric poets and – in modern times, especially – the many gifted style 
deviates, I feel something close to a conviction that we have only three or four very nearly nonexpendable poets, and I think 
Seymour will eventually stand with those few." <FONT size=2>(from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Seymour, An Introduction</FONT></I><FONT size=2>) </FONT></P>
<P>Twenty stories published in <I>Collier's</I>, <I>Saturday Evening Post</I>, <I>Esquire</I>, <I>Good Housekeeping</I>, <I>Cosmopolitan</I>, and the<I> New Yorker</I> between 1941 and 1948 appeared in a pirated edition in 1974, <EM>The Complete Uncollected Stories of J. D. Salinger</EM> (2 vols.). Many of them reflect Salinger's own service in the army. Later Salinger adopted Hindu-Buddhist influences. He became an ardent devotee of <I>The Gospels of Sri Ramakrishna</I>, a study of Hindu mysticism, which was translated into English by Swami Nikhilananda and Joseph Campbell.</P>
<P>Salinger's first novel, <I>The Catcher in the Rye</I>, became immediately 
a Book-of-the-Month Club selection and won huge international acclaim. It sells 
still some 250 000 copies annually. Salinger did not do much to help publicity, 
and asked that his photograph should not be used in connection with the book. Later he 
turned down requests for movie adaptations of the book. </P>
<P>The novel, written in a monologue and in lively slang, took its title from a line by 
Robert Burns, in which the protagonist Holden Caulfied misquoting it sees himself as a 'catcher in the rye' who must keep the world's 
children from falling off 'some crazy cliff'. The first reviews of the work were mixed, although most critics considered it brilliant. Its 16-year old restless hero – 
as Salinger was in his youth – runs away from school during his Christmas break to New York to find himself and lose his virginity. He spends an evening going to nightclubs, has an unsuccessful encounter with a prostitute, and the next day meets an old girlfriend. After getting drunk he sneaks home. Holden's former schoolteacher makes homosexual advances to him. He meets his sister to tell her that he is leaving home and has a nervous breakdown. The humor of the novel places it in the tradition of <A href="mtwain.htm">Mark Twain</A>'s classical works, <I>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</I> and <I>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</I>, but its world-view is more disillusioned. Holden describes everything as 'phoney' and is constantly in search of sincerity. Holden represents the early hero of adolescent angst, but full of life, he is the great literary opposite of Goethe's young Werther. </P>
<P>From time to time rumors spread that Salinger will publish another novel, or that he is publishing his work under a pseudonym, perhaps such as 
Thomas Pynchon. <B>"</B>Yet a real artist, I've noticed, will survive anything. (Even praise, I happily suspect.)," Salinger wrote in 
<I>Seymour – An Introduction</I>. From the late 60's he avoided publicity. Journalists assumed, that because he didn't give interviews, he 
had something to hide. In 1961 <I>Time Magazine</I> sent a team of reporters to investigate his private life. "I like to write. 
I love to write. But I write just for myself and my own pleasure," said Salinger in 1974 to a <I>New York Times </I>correspondent. </P><P>A
ccording to Joyce Maynard, who was close to the author in the 1970s, Salinger continued to write alone in his study, but locked the pages into a safe. They met after he had seen her picture on the cover of the <EM>New York Times Magazine</EM> and read her essay 'An 18-Year-Old Looks Back.' Maynard received a letter from the author, and&nbsp;following an intense correspondence she moved 
in with him. Maynard, who suffered from anorexia, saw Salinger as her rescuer, and her destination. Salinger lived an austere life,&nbsp;he studied and practiced homeopathy, and ate &nbsp;sparingly, mainly raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, and carefully cooked lamb patties. Together they watched television sitcoms, and practiced yoga and meditated. Salinger&nbsp;suddenly broke off their&nbsp;relationship. Years afterwards, Maynard&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;novel entitled <EM>Baby Love</EM> (1981), about a young woman and her much older lover. Joseph Heller and Raymond Carver praised&nbsp;the work, but Salinger dismissed it as " piece of junk."&nbsp;<EM>At Home in the World</EM> (1998), Maynard's 
story of her relationship with Salinger,&nbsp;received mixed reviews. Before the publication of the book, Salinger had said, "I knew you would amount to this." </P>
<P>Ian Hamilton's unauthorized biography of Salinger was rewritten, when the author did not accept extensive 
quoting of his personal letters. The new version, <EM>In Search of J.D. Salinger</EM>,&nbsp;came in 1988. In 1992 
a fire broke out in Salinger's Cornish house, but he managed to flee from the reporters who saw an
 opportunity to interview him. Since the late 80s Salinger was married to Colleen O'Neill. Salinger 
broke his silence through his lawyers in 2009, when they launceh a legal action to stop the publication 
of 
an unauthorised sequel to the Caulfield's story, entitled 
<I>60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye</I> released in Britain under the pseudonym John David 
California. The 33-year-old Swedish writer, Fredrik Colting, has earlier published humor books. Salinger 
died at his home on January 27, 2010. </P>
