      <p>This Chilean poet, and diplomat, was awarded the Nobel Prize
for
Literature in 1971. His original name was Neftali Ricardo Reyes
Basoalto, but he used the pen name Pablo Neruda for over 20 years
before adopting it legally in 1946. Neruda is the most widely read of
the Spanish American poets. From the 1940s on, his works reflected the
political struggle of the left and the socio-historical developments in
South America. He also wrote love poems. Neruda's <i>Twenty Love Poems
and a Song of Despair</i> (1924) have sold over a million copies since
it first appeared. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Sucede que me canso de ser hombre.
        </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Sucede que entro es las sasterías y en los cines
        </font><br>
        <font size="2">marchito, impenetrable, como un cisne de fieltro
        </font><br>
        <font size="2">navegando en un agua de origen y ceniza."</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'Walking Around'</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>(I happen to be tired of being a
man <br>
I happen to enter tailor shops and movie houses <br>
withered, impenetrable, like a felt swan <br>
navigating in a water of sources and ashes.)</b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Pablo Neruda was born Neftalí Ricardo Reyes Basoalto in
Parral, a
small town in central Chile. His father, don José del Carmen Reyes
Morales, was a poor railway worker. Rosa Basoalto de Reyes, Nerusa's
mother, was a schoolteacher, who died of tuberculosis when Neruda was
an infant. Don José Carmen moved with his sons in 1906 to Temuco, and
married Trinidad Candia Marvedre. Neruda started to write poetry when
he was ten years old. At the age of 12 he met the Chilean poet <a href="../../../gmistral.htm">Gabriela Mistral</a>,
who encouraged his literary efforts. The American poet Walt Whitman,
whose framed portrait Neruda later kept on his table, become a major
influence on his work. "I, a poet who writes in Spanish, learned more
from Walt Whitman than from Cervantes," Neruda said in 1972 in a speech
during a visit in the United States. </p>
      <p>Neruda's first serious literary achievement, an article,
appeared in the magazine <i>La Manana</i> (1917). It was followed by
the poem, 'Mis ojos', which appeared in <i>Corre-Vuela.</i> (1918). To
avoid conflict with his family, who disapproved his literary ambitions,
he published poems in the magazine <i>Selva Austral</i>,
using the pen name Pablo Neruda. From 1921 he studied French at the
Instituto Pedagógico in Santiago. Neruda gained international fame as
an writer with<span style="font-style: italic;"> Veinte poemas de amor
y una canciòn desesperada</span> (1924), which is his most widely read
work. </p>
      <p>At the age of only 23 Neruda was appointed by the Chilean
government
as consul to Burma (now Myanmar). He held diplomatic posts in various
East Asian and European Countries, befriending among others the Spanish
poet <a href="../../../fglorca.htm">Federico García Lorca</a>. Neruda
continued to contribute to several literary and other magazines, among
them <i>La Nación</i>, <i>El Sol</i>, and <i>Revista de Occidente</i>.
He also started to edit in 1935 a literary publication, <i>Caballo
Verde para la Poesía</i>. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"We did meet forty years ago. At
that
time we were both influenced by Whitman and I said, jokingly in part,
'I don't think anything can be done in Spanish, do you?' Neruda agreed,
but we decided it was too late for us to write our verse in English.
We'd have to make the best of a second-rate literature." </b>(in </font><a href="../../../jlborges.htm"><i><font size="2">Jorge Luis Borges</font></i></a><i><font size="2">: Conversations</font></i><font size="2">, ed.&nbsp; Richard
Burgin, 1998) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After Neruda ended his affair with the possessive and
violently
jealous Josie Bliss, he married in 1930 María Antonieta Hagenaar, a
Dutch woman who couldn't speak Spanish; they separated in 1936. At that
time Neruda lived in Paris, where he published with Nancy Cunard the
journal <i>Los Poetas del Mundo Defiende al Pueblo Español.</i> Nancy
Cunard was the sole inheritor of the famous Cunard shipping company,
who later followed Neruda to Chile with a bullfighter. Her mother
disinherited her when she escaped from high society with a black
musician. In the 1930s and 1940s Neruda lived with the Argentine
painter Delia del Carril, who encouraged Neruda to participate in
politics. Neruda and Delia del Carril married in 1943, but the marriage
was not recognized in Chile; they separated in 1955. Neruda married in
1966 the Chilean singer Matilde Urrutia. She was the inspiration of
much of Neruda's later poetry, among others <i>One Hundred Love Sonnets</i>
(1960). </p>
      <p>Neruda's first volume of <span style="font-style: italic;">Residencia
en la tierra</span>
(1933) was a visionary work, written in the Far East but emerging from
the birth of European fascism. During his Marxist period, Neruda
rejected the <i>Residencia</i> (1933, 1935, 1947) cycle, but in 1960
he urged to include poems from it to an anthology of his verse. In
1935-36 he was in Spain but he resigned from his post because he sided
with the Spanish Republicans. After the leftist candidate don Pedro
Aguirre Cerda won the presidental election, Neruda again was appointed
consul, this time to Paris, where he helped Spanish refugees by
re-settling them in Chile. </p>
      <p>In 1942 Neruda visited Cuba and read for the first time his
poem,
'Canto de amor para Stalingrado', which praised the Red Army fighting
in Stalingrad. His daughter, Malva Marina, died in the same year in
Europe. Neruda joined the Communist Party, and in 1945 he was elected
to the Chilean Senate. He attacked President González Videla in print
and when the government was taken by right-wing extremists, he fled to
Mexico. He travelled to the Soviet Union, where he was warmly received,
and in other Eastern European countries. He met Ilya Ehrenburg, whose
home was full of works by Picasso, and the Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet,
who lived in exile in Moscow. The Soviet Union was for Neruda a
country, where libraries, universities, and theatres were open for all.
Neruda was especially impressed by the vastness of Russia, its birch
forests, and rivers. He referred to dogmatism in the Soviet art, but
optimistically believed that these tendencies had been condemned.
Neruda's colleagues also read him Boris Pasternak's poems but they did
not forget to mention that Pasternak was considered as a political
reactionary. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Canto general</span>&nbsp;
(1950), which&nbsp; Neruda produced in exile, is a monumental work of
340 poems. <font size="2"><b>"</b></font>Come
up with me, American love. / Kiss these secret stones with me. / The
torrential silver of the Urubamba / makes the pollen fly to its golden
cup. The hollow of the bindweed's maze, the petrified plant, the
inflexible garland, soar above the silence of these mountain coffers." <font size="2">(From 'The Heights of Macchu Picchu'.) </font>Neruda
examined Latin American history from a Marxist point of view, and
showed his deep knowledge about the history, geography and politics of
the continent. The central theme is the struggle for social justice. <i>Canto
general </i>includes
Neruda's famous poem 'Alturas de Macchu Picchu', which was born after
he visited the Incan ruins of Macchu Picchu in 1943. In it Neruda
aspires to become the voice of the dead people who once lived in the
city. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I want to know, salt of the roads,
        </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">
show me the spoon - architecture, let me </font><br>
        <font size="2">
scratch at the stamens of stone with a little stick, </font><br>
        <font size="2">
ascend the rungs of the air up to the void, </font><br>
        <font size="2">
scrape the innards until I touch mankind."</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">
(in 'The Heights of Macchu Picchu') </font></blockquote>
      <p>While in exile, Neruda travelled in Italy, where he lived for
a
while. After the victory of the anti-Videla forces and the order to
arrest leftist was rescinded, Neruda returned to Chile. During a visit
to Buenos Aires in 1957 Neruda was arrested and he spent a restless
night in jail. Just before he was released, a policeman gave him a
poem, devoted to the famous author. Neruda was awarded in 1953 the
Stalin Prize. He remained faithful to "el partido" when a number of
intellectuals had already rejected Moscow's leash; poetry was not for
Neruda simply an expression of emotions and personality, it was "a deep
inner calling in man; from it came liturgy, the psalms, and also the
content of religions." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Memoirs</font></i><font size="2">, 1974)</font>.
However, Neruda's faith was deeply shaken in 1956 by Khrushchev's
revelation at the Twentieth Party Congress of the crimes committed
during the Stalin regime. Neruda's collection <span style="font-style: italic;">Estravagario</span>
(1958), in which he turned to his youth, reflects this change in his
opinions. He presents the reader with his daily life and examines
critically his Marxist beliefs. </p>
      <p>Establishing
a permanent home on the Isla Negra, Neruda
continued to
travel extensively, visiting Cuba in 1960 and the United States in
1966. After Salvador Allende was elected president, Neruda was
appointed Chile's ambassador to France (1970-72). Neruda died of
leukemia in Santiago on 23 September, 1973, in Santa Maria Clinic,
where he was treated for prostate cancer. His illness was probably
accelerated by the murder of Allende and tragedies caused by Pinochet
coup. The poet's former driver claimed that Pinochet's agents injected
poison into Neruda's stomach. A new investigation&nbsp;into&nbsp;his
death&nbsp;was opened in 2011. The Neruda Foundation has rejected the
murder theory. In February 2013 the Chilean judge Mario Carroza ordered
Neruda's remains exhumed as part of an investigation into the poet's
death.&nbsp; Neruda was buried next
to his wife Matilde Urrutia in Isla Negra. He was exhumed in April
2013. According to the head of Chile's medical legal service, his body
was in good shape. <br>
</p>
      <p>After Neruda's death his homes in Valparaiso and
Santiago were robbed. During his long literary career, Neruda produced
more than forty volumes of poetry, translations, and verse drama.
Neruda is recognized to be among the major poets of the 20th century.
Positive criticism have not managed to soften the edges of his vision. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He was once referred as the
Picasso of
poetry, alluding to his protean ability to be always in the vanguard of
change. And he himself has often alluded to his personal struggle with
his own tradition, to his constant need to search for a new system in
each book." </b>(Rene de Costa, in <i>The Poetry of Pablo Neruda</i>,
1979) </font></blockquote>
