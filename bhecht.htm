producer,
playwright, novelist, "the Shakespeare of Hollywood", who received
screen credits, alone or in collaboration, for the stories or
screenplays of some 70 films. As a prolific storyteller, Ben Hecht
authored 35 books and created some of the most entertaining screenplays
or plays, among them <span style="font-style: italic;">The Front Page</span>
with Charlie MacArthur (also filmed as <span style="font-style: italic;">His Girl Friday</span>), <span style="font-style: italic;">Twentieth Century</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Underworld</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Notorious</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Scoundrel</span> (as play <span style="font-style: italic;">All He Ever Loved</span>), <span style="font-style: italic;">Some Like It Hot</span> etc.</p>
      <blockquote><font color="White">-</font><b><font size="2">"...

Arabian Night in which he lived, could one accept it with the heart of
a child rather than the dull incredulity of a modern author." </font></b><font size="2">(from 'The Shadow' in </font><i><font size="2">The Collected
Stories of Ben Hecht</font></i><font size="2">, 1945) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Ben Hecht was was born in New York, the son of Russian-Jewish
immigrants.
His family later moved to Racine, Wisconsin, where he attended high
school. At the age of 12, he performed as a circus acrobat, and after a
brief period at the University of Wisconsin, he moved to Chicago, where
he worked as a reporter for <i>Chicago Journal </i>and <i>Chicago
Daily News</i>. He also contributed to literary magazines, including
the <i>Little Review</i>. <br>
      </p>
      <p>After World War I Hecht was sent by Chicago <i>Daily News </i>to
Berlin to witness the revolutionary movements, these experiences gave
him material for his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Erik
Dorn</span> (1921). while in Berlin, Hecht became close friends with
the artist George Grosz and was a guest of honour at a famous Data
demonstration: a race of six typewriters and six sewing-machines,
accompanied by a swearing contest. At the hotel Adlon, which was the
headquarters of the American press, Hecht also showed his talents as a
musician: "The host, whom everyone called Benny [Hecht], sat
cross-legged on top of the piano playing "Everybody Shimmies Now" on a
fiddle. His wife accompanied him. There was glasses everywhere and
ashtrays filled to the brim with butts; on our table were Havanas,
cigarettes, two long-necked Rhine-wine bottles on ice, a quarter-full
bottle of Black &amp; White and a bottle of Cognac. A gigantic tin near
the piano was said to contain ship's biscuits... towards four in the
morning Benny started to conduct the band, and taught the pianist to
play ragtime."<font size="2"> (George Grosz in <i>A Small Yes and a
Big No</i>, 1982) </font></p>
      <p>A daily column, <i>101 Afternoons in Chicago</i>, later
collected
in a book, brought Hecht fame. By the early 1920s, he had established
his reputation in the literary scene as a reporter, columnist, short
story writer, and novelist. Hecht left the <i>News</i> and founded in
1923 his own newspaper<i> The Chicago Literary Times</i>. New art and
architecture fascinated him, and he published several articles about
the aesthetics of urban environment. His enthusiasm bore a far
resemblance to the ideas formulated in Marinetti's <i>Manifesto of
Futurism</i> (1909). In an essay published in 1923, Hecht wrote about
the Temple Building in Chicago at Clark and Washington Streets and saw
the white body of the building "as delighting to our vanities as were
the triumphal figures of gods and goddesses to the conquering legions
returned to Rome." <font size="2">(from </font><font size="2"><i>Rediscovering
Ben Hecht, Volume 2: Art &amp; Architecture on 1001 Afternoons</i>, Ben
Hecht and F.W. Kovan, </font><a href="http://www.benhechtbooks.net/"><font size="2">Snickersnee Press</font></a><font size="2">, 2000). </font>
After two years, <i>The Chicago Literary Times</i> left Hecht
penniless, and he moved to New York City. A telegram from the
screenwriter
Herman Mankiewicz brought him to Hollywood; from then on Hecht divided
his time between movie assignments and New York. </p>
      <p><i>The Front Page </i>(1928), was a comedy-drama set in
Chicago. Hildy Johnson is a newspaper reporter. He has left his work,
he is going to marry and move to New York. He visits the pressroom of
Chicago Criminal Courts Building to bid his friends good-bye. Earl
Williams, an escaped murderer, falls in through the window. Earl's stay
of execution has been ignored by corrupt officials. Hildy plans to hide
Williams with the help of Walter Burns, his managing editor, and expose
the civic corruption. They are caught by the sheriff, but Hildy avoids
arrest and prepares to leave for the railroad station. Walter presents
him with his watch as a wedding gift. To keep Hildy on his staff,
Walter wires New York claiming that Hildy stole the watch. (Produced
New York, Times Square Theatre, August 14, 1928) - Several film
adaptations, among them <i>The Front Page</i> (1931), dir. by Lewis
Milestone, starring Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brian; <i>His Girl Friday</i>
(1940), dir. by Howard Hawks, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell;
      <i>The Front Page</i> (1974), dir. by Billy Wilder, starring Jack
Lemmon and Walter Matthau; <i>Switching Channels</i> (1988), dir. by
Ted Kotcheff, starring Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Writing a good movie brings a
writer about as much fame as steering a bicycle. It gets him, however,
more jobs. If his movie is bad it will attract only critical tut-tut
for him. The producer, director and stars are the geniuses who get the
hosannas when it's a hit. Theirs are also the heads that are mounted on
spears when it's a flop." </b></font><font size="2">(Hecht in 'Let's
Make the Hero a MacArthur,' </font><i><font size="2">The Penguin Book
of Hollywood</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Christopher Silvester,
1998) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In Hollywood Hecht wrote scripts often with Charles MacArthur.
Their collaboration led among others to the musical<span style="font-style: italic;"> Jumbo </span>(with music by Richard
Rogers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart), <span style="font-style: italic;">Ladies
and Gentlemen</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Fun To Be Free</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Swan Song</span>. The pair
received an Academy Award nomination for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Scoundrel</span> (1935). Hecht himself
won an Academy Award for <i>Underworld</i> (1927). In 1957, Hecht
published a biography of his friend Charles MacArthur, entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Charlie</span>. With the director John
Ford, who worked in the 1930s for Samuel Goldwyn, Hecht cooperated in <i>The
Hurricane</i> (1937), an unlucky film project. When he first saw its
footage, he said: "I think it stinks." Hecht wrote new dialogue scenes
and Ford shot them. In <i>Stagecoach</i> (1939), one of Ford's most
famous films, Hecht suggested that the character of Ringo (John Wayne
in his breakthrough role) is "a kid out of prison." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The only place I felt at home was
in your heart. You were the only light that didn't go out on me."</b>
(from </font><i><font size="2">Angels Over Broadway</font></i><font size="2">, 1940) </font></blockquote>
      <p>To <span style="font-style: italic;">Angels Over
Broadway&nbsp;</span> (1940) Hecht added his view about the war in
Europe. Douglas Fairbanks Jr asks in his speech: "What happened to the
Poles, the Finns, the Dutch? They're little guys. They didn't win...'
Rita Hayworth replies,<b> </b>'They will, some day.'<font size="2"> </font>Hecht's
cooperation with Alfred Hitchcock started in <i>Foreign Correspondent</i>
(1940), although Hecht's additions were uncredited. When Hitchcock was
asked about the anti-Nazi and pro-Britain message of the film &#8211; United
States was still 18 months away from the war&nbsp; the director said
that it was all the doing of Walter Wanger and Ben Hecht. </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2">JONES</font><font size="2">: Keep
those lights burning, cover them with steel, build them in with guns,
build a canopy of battleships and bombing planes around them and,
hello, America, hang on to your lights, they're the only lights in the
world.</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Foreign
Correspondent</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p><i>Spellbound </i>(1945) was based on the novel <i>The House
of Dr. Edwardes</i> by Francis Beeding. In the process of scripting,
almost nothing of the novel was left except, remotely, the idea of the
villain turning out to be the asylum director, who is of course mad.
The eccentric Spanish painter Salvador Dali designed the famous dream
sequences. The next film, <i>Notorious </i>(1946), was made with
almost exactly the same team - David O. Selznick producing, Ben Hecht
scripting, and Ingrid Bergman starring. The film was based on a<i>
Saturday Evening Post </i>story called 'The Song of the Flame', which
was further developed by Hitchcock and Hecht. When the script for <i>The
Paradine Case</i> (1947) needed rewriting, Hecht was called in, but his
additions were uncredited. Hitchcock would have liked Hecht to do
script for <i>Strangers on a Train </i>(1951), but the author was
otherwise occupied, and the director did get one of Hecht's assistants,
Czenzi Ormonde to work with <a href="/rchandle.htm">Raymond Chandler</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The director Howard Hawks worked with Hecht in several film
projects. <i>Scarface</i> from 1932 was based on Hecht's story, in <i>Viva
Villa</i> (1934), for which Hecht wrote the screenplay, Hawks worked
uncredited. <i>Twentieth Century</i> (1934), written by Hecht and
Charles McArthur, was directed and produced by Hawks. Other film
projects included <i>Barbary Coast </i>(1935), <i>His Girl Fiday </i>(1940),<i>
The Outlaw</i> (1943), <i>The Thing from Another World</i> (1951).
While working with<i> Viva Villa</i> in Mexico Hecht had an affair with
another woman, and when his wife Rose, showed up unannounced, the
panicked author turned to Hawks. The director advised:<b><font size="2">
      </font></b>"'You'd better be perfectly honest. Be a reporter and
tell her the story of her husband who's down here with another woman
and what's she going to do about it?' And he did and by God he got away
with it... I think Ben amused me most when he got into a real bind. He
enjoyed being the brunt of trouble, it kept him very busy thinking how
to get out of it."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Howard
Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood</font></i><font size="2"> by Todd
McCarthy, 1997) </font>In <i>His Girl Friday</i>
Hawks could not use the writer &#8211; he was busy doing uncredited rewrites
for Victor Fleming on <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, and preparing <i>Angels
over Broadway</i>. The major change compared to the Broadway production
was the sex change. Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) became the ex-wife
of Walter Burns (Cary Grant) - they had been married and divorced but
Burns schemes to get Hildy back. </p>
      <p>Hecht's criticism of British policies in Palestine and support
of the Jewish resistance movement caused that his credits were removed
from all films shown in England for some years. In his honor an illegal
immigrant ship was named "Ben Hecht". A passionate believer in an
independent Jewish state, Hecht advocated swift action to attain this.
In <span style="font-style: italic;">A Guide for the Bedevilled</span>&nbsp;
(1944) Hecht defended his views and gained many enemies. Later, in his
book entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Perfidy</span>, Hecht
acknowledged the death of his of Zionist dream &#8211; the work dealt with
the events of the 'Dr Rudolf Kastner trial'. The accused, a lawyer and
fanatical Zionist, collaborated with Adolf Eichmann during the war.
Kastner left the members of his community, Hungarian Jews, in the hands
of the Nazis because he felt that rescuing them would interfere with
establishment of the state of Israel. Due to the politically charged
subject, Hecht's book was banned in Israel. Kastner was assassinated in
Tel Aviv by an Israeli undercover agent. Kenneth A. Alford and Theodore
P. Savas have suggested in their book <i>Nazi Millionaires: The Allied
Search for Hidden SS Gold</i> (2002) that the circumstances of Hecht's
death were also suspicious. </p>
      <p>Hecht was married twice, first in 1915 and after divorce in
1925.
His daughter Jenny from his second marriage achieved success as an
actress
from the age of eight. She apparently was in <i>Actors and Sin</i>
(1952) a 9-year-old girl who writes a steamy screenplay for a movie
expected to became the next "Gone with the Wind." The film was written
and directed by Hecht, but received bad reviews. "A depressing double
bill," wrote Lindsay Anderson. The first movie that Kirk Douglas' the
Bryna Company produced was <i>The Indian Fighter</i> (1955), based on
the screenplay by Hecht and Frank Davis. The Indian Western, perhaps
best remembered for Elsa Martinelli's bathing scene, did well and
helped to launch other film projects for the company. Hecht died of a
heart attack on April 19, 1964, while working on the script of <i><a href="/ifleming.htm">Casino Royale</a></i> (1967). Hecht received no
screen credits. Among productions credited to other writers are <i>Queen
Christina</i>, <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, <i>Foreign Correspondent</i>,
      <i>The Outlaw</i>, <i>Lifeboat</i>, <i>Gilda</i>, <i>The
Paradine Case</i>, <i>Rope</i>, and <i>Roman Holiday</i>. Hawks
bought the story for <i>The Outlaw</i> from Hecht, and began to
develop the script with Jules Furthman. Eventually Howard Hughes took
over the production and directed the film, starring Jane Russell and
Jack Beutel. </p>

song to give you a good laugh.' When they arrive in Rio, she
berates Devlin's lack of faith in her: 'Why don't
you give that copper's brain of yours a rest? Every time you look at
me, I can see it dwelling over its slogans. "Once a crook, always a
crook". "Once a tramp, always a tramp". Go on. You can hold my hand, I
won't blackmail you for it afterwards.')</li>
