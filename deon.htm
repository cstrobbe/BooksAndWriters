      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa tästä --> Diplomat, writer, spy, and
Freemason, a member of the elite Dragoons and one of the best swordsmen
France, whose true gender was a source of speculation and provoked
public bets in the late 18th century. Generally it was believed that
d'Eon was born female, but he had started to dress as a man in his
childhood, and changed back from "a bad boy into a good girl" when his
secret was revealed decades later. After his death it turned out that
he was a man who had dressed as a woman. D'Eon is often called the
patron saint of transvestites. Voltaire once famously called him "A nice problem for history." <br>
 </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Let us then live the life of
children of God, and let us stop simply usurping that name. God makes
clear whenever he pleases that he is the master of heart. He alone can
change us;he alone must be glorified for our change; for allowing us to
overcome prejudices from birth and habit."</b> (from 'Extrait de
l'Epître de la Chev. d'Eon à Madame la Duchesse de
Montmorency-Bouteville à Versailles mai 1778', from </font><i><font size="2">Monsieur d'Eon is a Woman</font></i><font size="2"> by Gary
Kates, 1995) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Charles-Geneviève-Louis-Auguste-André-Thimothée d'Eon de
Beaumont was born in Tonnere, into a family of lawyers. His father,
Louis d&#8217;Eon de Beaumont, was an attorney and Sub-Delegate of the Paris
Intendancy; his mother, lady Françoise de Chavanson, was a noblewoman
from an old and wealthy family. Little is known of d'Eon's childhood
and his book of memoirs, <i>La Vie Militaire, politique, et privée de
Mademoiselle d'Eon </i>(1779), written by his friend La Fortelle, is
not very reliable. D'Eon tells in it that he was born female, and
raised from the start as a boy. His father Louis was in debts and he
would get a large inheritance from Françoise's family only if she had a
son. D'Eon also reveals, that until the age of ten, he was "under the
yoke of an involuntary urinary flow." </p>
      <p>D'Eon learned to read at a very young age, and at school he
excelled in languages and won awards for memorization. After graduating
from College Mazarin in Paris in 1749 he worked as the secretary of
Monsieur de Sauvigny, administrator of the fiscal department of Paris.
There he completed his first book on French government finance. He then
worked as a royal censor, spending his time with books. In 1756 d'Eon
joined the King's Secret, a network of spies, who worked more for the
King himself than the Foreign Ministry. </p>
      <p>To create contacts between Russian and France, Louis XV sent
d'Eon in 1756 on a secret mission to Russia to meet Empress Elizabeth
I. On the journey d'Eon served as a secretary of the Chevalier Douglas,
but disguising himself as a woman, he could in secret start
negotiations with Elizabeth. His journey was successful. By 1757 Russia
and France had reestablished diplomatic relations. </p>
      <p>D'Eon returned to France in 1761. Next year he was appointed a
captain of the elite Dragoons. The Seven Years' War, which had started
in 1756, was nearing its end, and d'Eon fought only in one major
campaign. However, he showed courage and skill, and also was wounded in
the head and thigh. For his services and help in Franco-Russian peace
negotiations, d'Eon was awarded at the age of thirty-five the rare
Cross of Saint-Louis. The Cross raised him in noble rank &#8211; he was known
as the Chevalier d'Eon. </p>
      <p>In 1763 d'Eon was appointed Plenipotentiary Minister in
London. At the same time he worked as a spy for the King, who played
with an invasion plan. D'Eon had reached the peak of his career and
fall followed soon. His lifestyle was sumptuous, he enjoyed fully his
high position, and he spent much money to create right connections with
English counts, dukes, and lords. From wineyeards in his own estate or
neighboring districs, he imported and gave as gifts Burgundian wine.
This generosity made him very popular among aristocratic wine
connoisseurs. </p>
      <p>When he was informed that he would have to give up the title
of Plenipotentiary Minister, he complained of his treatment to a number
of influential friends. Nobody helped him. In October 1763 he refused
to follow orders to leave England. D'Eon was afraid that he would be
kidnapped and taken to France and in a letter to Louis XV he claimed
the new ambassador, the Comte de Guerchy tried to have him poisoned.
"Subsequently I have discovered that M. de Guerchy caused opium, if
nothing worse, to be put in my wine, calculating that after dinner I
should fall into a heavy sleep, that they would put me, still asleep,
onto a couch and, instead of my being carried home, I should be carried
down to the Thames where probably there was a boat waiting ready to
abduct me." <br>
      </p>
      <p>The book which made d'Eon famous was <i>Lettres, mémoires, et
négociations particuliéres </i>(1764), a secret diplomatic
correspondence dealing with his recall. Noteworthy, he did not publish
the King's secret plan to invade England, which perhaps saved his life.
In 1766 Louis XV granted him an annual pension of 12,000 livres for the
services he had rendered to the King in Russia, in the army and other
commissions. D'Eon continued to work as a spy, but he had also another
hobby &#8211; books. During his London residency he spent much of his time in
his library, which contained eventually some 6,000 volumes and 500 rare
manuscripts. </p>
      <p>D'Eon's political exile lasted fourteen years. In 1770 rumors
started to spread that the Burgundian Chevalier was a woman, and soon
people began to bet on the question. D'Eon's behavior was not
considered effeminate, he looked like a man, and used his uniform of a
French Dragoon captain. On the other hand, the rumors did not help
d'Eon's work in the King's Service. <br>
      </p>
      <p>After Louis XV's death in 1774, D'Eon negotiated with <a href="beaum.htm">Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais </a>
(1732-1799), famous for his play <i>The Barber of Seville</i> (1775)
and later <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> (1784), about his return to
France. Louis XVI, the new King, rejected the old plans for an invasion
of Britain, but he was much interested in getting back d'Eon's secret
papers. One of d'Eon's demands in the negotiations was that the
government publicly recognizes him as a woman &#8211; the King had no
objections, and ordered him to wear women's clothes. He was also
granted funds for his female wardrobe. In pictures d'Eon is often
depicted in relatively comfortable clothes, skirts, and low heels
instead of high heels of women. On his left breast d'Eon carried the
Cross of Saint-Louis. </p>
      <p>D'Eon returned to France in 1777 and met in November Louis XVI
and Maria-Antoinette. Next year, when France joined the American War of
Independence against Britain, d'Eon sent letters to King's ministers,
begging them to continue his military service and send him to America.
Instead he was taken to a dungeon beneath the Château of Dijon, where
he spent nineteen days. The following six years he lived mostly with
his mother at the family's home in Tonnerre. Christian faith,
especially Jansenist ideas, became important in his life</p>
      <p>In 1785, four years before the French Revolution, d'Eon
returned to England where he lived the rest of his life. England was
for him "a country more free than Holland and well worthy of being
visited by a man of thought and lover of liberty..." Horace Walpole met
d'Eon in 1786 and found him loud, noisy, and vulgar &#8211; "her hands and
arms seem not to have participated of the change of sexes, but are
fitter to carry a chair than a fan." James Boswell wrote that "she
appeared to me a man in woman's clothes." After the Revolution d'Eon's
annual pension was suspended, and he had to sell his huge library to
cover part of his debts. To earn money he participated in fencing
tournaments, fighting once with the Price of Wales. In 1796 he was
wounded seriously. During his last years he lived in misery, sharing
his apartment for about fourteen years with a widow, Mrs. Cole, whose
husband had been an admiral. In 1792 he sent a letter to France to the
National Assembly, and volunteered "to fight and die for the nation,
the Law, and the King" and to lead a division of women soldiers against
Austria. In 1805 he signed a contract for his autobiography, entitled <i>La
Pucelle de Tonnerre</i>, which was never published. </p>
      <p>D'Eon died in London on May 21, 1810. Postmortem examination
proved that he was not a hermaphrodite, or a woman, but a male. A group
of expets, who were called to the apartment, performed "a complete
inspection and dissection of the sexual parts" of d'Eon's body. The
physicians also discovered that his Adam's apple did not protrude and
he did not have femalelike breasts. It has been suggested that d'Eon 
had Hypogonadotropin eunuchoidism or Kallman's syndrome, a congenital
sexual disorder characterized by underdeveloped genitalia and sterile
gonads.</p>
      <p>D'Eon had been a spy in international politics but the rest of
his life he spent as a spy in the world of women, dying peacefully
during his self-created mission. Perhaps to protect the reputation of
his lady friends who trusted him, he did not reveal his true gender. It
is noteworthy, that d'Eon lived through the period, during which
Voltaire (1694-1778) questioned the doctrines of the Church, Rousseau
(1712-1788) declared "Man is born free; and everywhere he is in
chains," the<i> ancien régime</i> was destroyed in the French
Revolution, and Napoleonic Wars spread the ideals of liberty, equality,
and fraternity. Although d'Eon did not share the views of the later
revolutionary leaders, Marat, Danton or Robespierre, he greeted with
enthusiasm the storming of the Bastille and its message of freedom. He
admired the patron saint of Amazonian women, Joan of Arc, but when she
equipped herself with armour, d'Eon wore a dress and and cap as a
challenge to traditional gender roles.</p>
