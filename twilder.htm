<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American writer and playwright, best known
for the Pulitzer Prize awarded play <span style="font-style: italic;">Our Town</span> (1938). Wilder's breakthrough
novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</span>
(1927), an examination of justice and altruism. The story focused on
the fates of five travelers in the 18-century Peru, who happen to be
crossing the finest bridge in the land when it breaks and throws them
into the gulf below. A scholarly monk, Brother Juniper, interprets the
story of each victim in an attempt to explain the working of divine
providence. Surely, he argues, if there were any plan in the universe
at all, if there were any pattern in human life, it could be discovered
mysteriously latent in the lives of those particular people. But his
book being done the text is pronounced heretical and and both Juniper
and his work are burned by the Inquisition. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But soon we shall die and all memory of
those five will have left earth, and we ourselves shall be loved for a
while and forgotten. But the love will have been enough; all those
impulses of love return to the love that made them. Even memory is not
necessary for love. There is a land of the living and a land of the
dead and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Thornton Wilder was born in Madison, Wisconsin, one of five children
of Amos Parker Wilder, a newspaper editor, diplomat, and a strict
Calvinist, and Isabella (Niven) Wilder, the daughter of a Presbyterian
minister. Embracing the Puritan heritage of his family, Wilder said
later that "I don't think there's any doubt that the New England
tradition is the highest point to which civilization culture ever
attained.... My father, for all his faults, was the personification of
the tradition." Though only Thornton gained fame, all five Wilder children became published writers.<br>
 </p>
<p>In 1906 the family moved to Hong Kong, where his father had been
appointed American Consul General. At that time the salary given a diplomat was very small and after six months Wilder's mother
returned with her four children to the United States. The family
rejoined again in 1911 in Shanghai, where Amos Parker Wilder had been
transferred. <br>
</p>
<p>Wilder stayed in China for a year. In 1915 he enrolled in Oberlin
College, where he studied the Greek and Roman classics in translation.
The family moved in 1917 to to New Haven, Connecticut, and Wilder
entered Yale University. His first full-length play, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Trumpet Shall Sound</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>, appeared in 1920 in the <i>Yale Literary Magazine</i>, 
but it was not produced until 1926 by the American Laboratory Theater. </p>
<p>During WW I Wilder served for eight months in the Coast Artillery Corps as a corporal. He received his B.A. from 
Yale University in 1920, and went to Rome, where he studied  archaeology at the American Academy. While teaching 
French at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, Wilder continued to write. By 1926 he had received an M.A. 
degree in French literature from Princeton University. In the same year appeared his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cabala</span>, a 
fantasy about a young American visiting Rome, where he meets a group of Italian aristocrats, who turn out to be 
incarnations of the ancient Roman gods. </p>


<p>Although Wilder had set the events of <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i>
in Peru, it was not until 1941, when he visited the country. With the
success of this 34,000 word novella, Wilder could afford to resign his
position at Lawrenceville. From 1930 to 1937 Wilder was a part-time
lecturer in comparative literature at the University of Chicago, in
1935 he was a visiting professor at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu,
and in 1950-51 a professor of poetry at Harvard University, Cambridge,
Massachusetts. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Woman of Andros</span> (1930), set in ancient Greece and partly based on a comedy of Terence, reflected 
Wilder's deep immersion in the world of the classics. Wilder once stated, that "I am not an innovator but a 
rediscoverer of forgotten goods and I hope a remover of obtusive brick-a-brack." 

In the character of Chrysis the author created his archetype of the virtue of hope. The book was attacked 
by Michael Gold, the author of the novel<i> Jews Without Money</i> (1930) and the 
editor of the <i>New Masses</i>, who has been described 
as "the country's leading and most provocative proponent of proletarian art". 
Gold dismissed Wilder's work as irrelevant to the sufferings of the poor during the Depression and 
described his novels as "historic junkshop," peopled with "wan ghosts" undergoing "little lavender 
tragedies". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Like all the rich he could not bring
himself to believe that the poor (look at their houses, look at their
clothes!) could really suffer. Like all the cultivated he believed that
only the widely read could be said to </b></font><b><i><font size="2">know</font></i><font size="2"> that they were unhappy." </font></b><font size="2"></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</font></i><font size="2">) </font>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Heaven's My Destination</span> (1935) was Wilder's first novel set in America and drew a satirical portrait of 
an evangelical fundamentalist traveling salesman. Wilder's play <i>Our Town</i> was inspired 
by <a href="/gstein.htm">Gertrude Stein</a>'s <i>The Making of Americans</i> (1925) and gained 
a huge success. It earned Wilder another Pulitzer. The story was set in Grover's Corners, New 
Hampshire, and traced the childhood, courtship, marriage, and death of Emily Webb and George Gibbs. Each act is 
introduced by the Stage Manager in a direct address to the audience; the first act takes place on 7 May, 1901. 
Although the subject matter,  the lives of ordinary people in an average town, was for Wilder unusually 
provincial, the themes of the acts &#8211; Daily Life, Love and Marriage, and Death &#8211; were universal. </p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Skin of Our Teeth</span>, a history of human race, was inspired by <a href="/jjoyce.htm">James Joyce'</a>s <i>Finnegans 
Wake</i>. It depicted five thousand years in the lives of George and Maggie Antrobus, 
a suburban New Jersey couple, who, with their children Gladys and Henry and their maid Sabina, struggle through  
flood, famine, ice, and war only to begin the series all over again. The play won Wilder his third Pulitzer Prize. 
It was directed by Elia Kazan, with Tallulah Bankhead, Fredric March, and Florence Eldridge in the central roles. 
Montgomery Clift made an impact as Henry, a neurotic yet innocent son. When the production opened on Broadway 
at the Plymouth Theater on November 18, 1942, it received great critial acclaim. The <i>Times</i>'s Lewis 
Nichols called it "the best pure theater of the forties". </p>
<p>Wilder, whose glasses concealed his cold, light blue eyes, was famous for his sociability and energy. His 
counteless friends included Gertrude Stein, whom he met in 1934 in Chicago, Hemingway, Willa Cather, 
and Montgomery Clift, who frequently spent Sundays in Hamden at house of Wilder and his sister Isabel; he was interested 
in James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and T.S. Eliot. In an interview Wilder has said, that one of his central preoccupations 
throughout his work has been "the surprise of the guld between each tiny occasion of the daily life and the vast 
streches of time and place in which every individual plays his role." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights at Work</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by George Plimton, 2000)</font> Almost all of Wilder's novels were historical, but from <i>Heaven's My Destination</i>
Wilder began to approach the modern day America. He believed that
"there is no Golden Ages and no Dark Ages", but only "the ocean like
monotony of the generations of men under the alterations of fair and
foul weather". <b><font size="2"></font></b></p>
<p>Along with John Dos Passos, Wilder served as U.S. Representative at
PEN writers conference in London. In the same year Wilder was sent by
the U.S. State Department on South American goodwill tour. His fellow
passenger on the Grace Line's <i>Santa Lucia</i>, Sherwood Anderson, became seriously ill during the 
voyage and died at Christobal, at the end of the Panama Chanal. 
Early in WW II Wilder enlisted in the army. He eventually became a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and 
earned the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star. His responsibilities included the interrogation of prisoners and 
the preparation of reports for the Mediterranean Air Headquarters. 

In the 1940s Wilder also worked on the scenario for 
Alfred Hitchcock's film<i> Shadow of a Doubt</i> (1943), set in the small town of Santa Rosa, and began a play, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Emporium</span>, 
based on 
<a href="/kafka.htm">Franz Kafka</a>'s works &#8211; it was specially meant  for Montgomery Clift, who promised 
that he would play it anywhere, any place. After his discharge from the army, Wilder completed<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Ides of March&nbsp;</span> (1948), an 
experimental historical novel about Julius Caesar, with which he had been long struggling. </p>
<p>Wilder's later plays are darker in tone. His oldest sister Charlotte, a poet, was institutionalized for mental illness 
in 1941, and his mother died in 
1946. To his friends Wilder murmured that his own life had been a failure.  And it has also been suggested that Wilder was 
denied the Nobel Prize because he was &#8211; wrongly &#8211; accused of plagiarizing 
<i>The Skin of Our Teeth</i> from Joyce's <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. Wilder wrote    in the 1950s <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wreck of the 5:25</span> (1957),<span style="font-style: italic;"> 
Bernice</span> (1957), 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alcestiad</span>, based on Euripide's <i>Alcestis</i>, and performed at the Edinburgh Festival under the title 
of <i>Life in the Sun</i>.  When Montgomery Clift criticized its dialogue as forced and pedantic, 
Wilder became  according to the actor so enraged, that "he almost jumped into the Atlantic Ocean." 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Merchant of Younkers </span>(1938), a farce which had failed critically and commercially,
 was revised under the new title of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Matchmaker</span> (1954). Wilder had based his earlier work on 
a British play called <i>A Day Well Spent</i> by John Oxenford. Later <i>The Matchmaker</i> served as the 
source for the Broadway musical <i>Hello, Dolly!</i>, which opened in 1964 in New York, starring Carol Channing and music and 
lyrics by Jerry Herman. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I think myself as a fabulist, not a
critic. I realize that every writer is necessary a critic &#8211; that is,
each sentence is a skeleton accompanied by enormous activity of
rejection; and each selection is governed by general principles
concerning truth, force, beauty, and so on. But, as I have just
suggested, I believe that the practice of writing consists in more and
more relegating all that schematic operation to the subconscious. The
critic that is in every fabulist is like the iceberg - nine-tenths of
him is underwater." </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights at Work</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1962 Wilder received the first <i>National Medal for Literature</i> at a special White House ceremony. His last two novels were <span style="font-style: italic;">The Eighth Day</span> (1967), which moved back and forth through the 20th century and told a story about a talented inventor accused of murder, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Theophilus North</span>
(1973), about a sensitive young man and his nine possible careers.
Wilder died on December 7, 1975, Hamden, Connecticut, where he had
lived off and on for many years with his devoted sister, secretary,
business manager, and literary adviser, Isabel Wilder. Wilder never
married; he had one or two affairs with younger men. </p>
