<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>



<p>Italian novelist, essayist, translator and playwright, who has
written of her unconventional family and its opposition in Turin to
Fascist oppression. Ginzburg's novels are a mixture of reminiscence,
observation, and invention. Much of her fiction is written in the first
person in a plain style, and constructed almost entirely of dialogue. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A un certo punto della vita, tutto
quello su cui posiamo gli occhi per la prima volta ei è estraneo. Lo
guardiamo da turisti con intresse ma freddamente. Appartiene agli
altri."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">La città e la casa</font></i><font size="2">, 1984) </font></blockquote>
<p>Natalia Ginzburg was born Natalia Levi in Palermo into a
middle-class family. From her father's side, who was professor of
anatomy, she was Jewish, and from her mother's side she was Catholic.
However, Ginzburg was brought up an atheist, and this separated her
from other children. In 1919 her father accepted a professorship at the
University of Turin, where Ginzburg grew up in a cultural milieu. The
Levi household became a meeting place for many intellectuals, who
opposed Benito Mussolini. "... my father was an old-style Socialist,
but, well, he had no idea how to oppose Fascism," said Ginzburg later
in an interview. After her brother Mario escaped to Switzerland, her
father was arrested for some weeks. Ginzburg's mother, Livia Tanzi, was
a family friend of the prominent socialist politician Filippo Turati,
who&nbsp;went into exile&nbsp;to Paris.</p>
<p>For a period, Ginzburg attended literature courses at the University
of Turin, but then gave up her studies. In 1938 she married the editor
and political activist Leone Ginzburg; they had two children. Leone
Ginzburg, born in Odessa, was a brilliant Slavist and he helped
introduce Russian literature into Italy. In 1933 he refused to swear an
oath of allegiance to Fascism, and could not continue his career as a
teacher. Leone was one of the frequent visitors at <a href="croce.htm">Benedetto Croce</a>'s summer residence in Piedmont. Croce, a philosopher and Senator, 
was a well-known anti-fascist, 
whose houses were under surveillance. On account of his activities, the Ginzburgs 
spent&nbsp;three years in "confinement" in the Abruzzo village of Pizzoli,&nbsp;after which they went&nbsp;into hiding to 
Rome and Florence. Leone Ginzburg was arrested again in 1944, and he&nbsp;was tortured and killed&nbsp;in the Regina Coeli 
prison in Rome.</p>
<p>Ginzburg started her career as a writer publishing short stories in the distinguished Florentine periodical <i>Solaria</i>. Her first major work, 'Un'assenza', appeared in <i>Solaria</i> when she was seventeen and centrered on an unhappy, anguished individual who suffers from boredom. Ginzburg's first novella, <em>La strada che va in città</em> (1942), was published by Einaurdi under the pseudonym Alessandra Tornimparti. It was followed in 1947 by<em>&nbsp;</em><em>È stato così</em>,&nbsp;about
an unhappy marriage like the author's previous work. At the end the
narrator&nbsp;shoots her unfaithful husband.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After the liberation in 1944 Ginzburg returned to Turin with her
chilren. She worked as an editorial consultant for the new publishing
house of Giulio Einaudi. The publishing house had introduced such
writers as Cesare Pavese, Elio Vittorini and, a little later, Elsa
Morante and Italo Calvino. Ginzberg's translation of&nbsp; Marcel
Proust's <em>Swann's Way</em>
came out in 1946 and was later printed with some alterations in the
Einaurdi Gli struzzi series. Ginzburg herself
preferred&nbsp;the&nbsp;earlier version, which was&nbsp;more
passionate,&nbsp;and revised the adjustments. </p><p>In
1950&nbsp;Ginzburg married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English
literature at the university of Rome. She was widowed again&nbsp;in
1969&nbsp;and left with a seriously handicapped daughter to care
for.&nbsp;Ginzburg lived from the 1950s mostly in Rome, where she
worked in publishing. From 1959 to 1961 she lived in London, following
there her husband, who had been nominated for three consecutive years
as director of the Italian Cultural Institute. </p><p><em>Tutti i nostri ieri</em>
(1952) a story of two families, one rich, one not, partly drew on her
experiences in detention on the country. Through the intertwined
histories Ginzburg portrays a generation that lived through Fascism,
war, the German invasion, resistance, and the Allied victory. The story
ends on a positive note. <em>Le voci della sera</em> (1961) was set in
Piedmont around the time of World War II.&nbsp; Ginzburg wrote the
novel in London. The humorous, autobiographical&nbsp;<em>Lessico famigliare</em>
(1963) was an account of Ginzburg's childhood, adolescence, and early
adulthood through the "family lexicon", words and phrases of the
various members of her family.</p>
<p>Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament in 1983 as an
independent left-wing deputy. She was reelected in 1987. "Sometimes
when I'm there in Parliament, on that sofa in the corridor, I'm
thinking deeply about things I want to write," Ginzburg once confessed.
(<i><font size="2">It's Hard to Talk about Yourself, </font></i><font size="2">ed. Cesare Garboli and Lisa Ginzburg, 2003</font>) Her later, internationally acclaimed works include <em>Caro Michele</em> (1973, Dear Michael), <em>La città e la casa</em> (1984, The City and the House), a chaotic novel,&nbsp;and <em>Serena Cruz, o la vera giustica</em><strong> </strong>(1990,
Serena Cruz, or True Justice), dealing with the case of Serena Cruz,
who had been taken away from her adoptive parents. Ginzburg died of
cancer on October 7, 1991. A few days before her death, she completed
the translation of Maupassant's <em>Une vie</em>. </p>
<p>Ginzburg wrote memoirs, several dramas, essays, translations from
such authors as Marcel Proust and Flaubert, and a biography of the poet
and essayist Alessandro Manzoni, <em>La famiglia Manzoni</em> (1983),
which reveals the failure of the great author as a father. Am reviewer
said of the style this work: "Everything is stated and nothing is
underlined or glossed or implied or invoked as material to argue
something different." Ginzburg's play<em> Ti ho sposato per allegria</em> (1965,&nbsp; I Married You for Fun) was written for the actress Adriana Asti. <em>L'inserzione</em> (1968, The Advertisement) was produced&nbsp;in London by Laurence Olivier, and in Italy by Luchino Visconti.

</p><p>In her earliest works Ginzburg consciously rejected any
autobiographical style or elements, which she saw as characteristic of
what she called "feminine" writing. However, she soon discovered that
it was through writing her personal experiences in a fictionalized
form, that she succeeded best in expressing herself. Many of her works
rely on memories of her childhood and youth in Turin. Recurrent
characters are frustrated intellectuals and women living static lives. <em>Valentino </em>(1957) was her first&nbsp;novel which portrayed homosexual figures. </p><p>As
an essayist Ginzburg has explored a wide variety of subjects from
current movies to books and art, and from pedagogy to morals and
individual rights. "At the center of our life is the question of human
relations," she said in one essay. In the preface for her translation
of <em>Il racconto di Peuw bambina cambogiana (1975-1980)</em>, which
came out in 1985, she asked why there was a total silence in the West
and the media about the Cambodian disaster. Ginzburg's style is sparse,
melancholic, but relieved by occasional flashes of humor. <font size="2"></font>"Too many descriptions; I can't bear descriptions in novels," Ginzburg stated in the novel <i>The City and the House</i><font size="2">.</font> Her major collections of essays were <em>Le piccole virtú</em>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<em>Mai devi domandarmi</em>&nbsp; (1970) and&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;Vita immaginaria</em>
(1974). In 'Il mio mestiere' (1949) she wrote: "I prefer to think that
no one has ever been like me, however small, however much mosquito or a
flea of a winter I might be." </p>
