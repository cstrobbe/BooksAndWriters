<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Russian poet, whose novel <em>Doktor Zhivago </em>brought him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. Though Pasternak was not 
a political writer, the award brought him brought him into the spotlight of international 
politics and he had to 
decline the honour. The novel 
was banned in the Soviet Union and Pasternak was 
expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers. After <i>Doctor Zhivago </i>had reached 
the West, it was soon translated into 18 languages. Pasternak was 
rehabilitated posthumously in 1987, which made possible the publication of his major work.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Yura enjoyed being with his uncle. He
reminded him of his mother. Like hers, his mind moved with freedom and
welcomed the unfamiliar. He had the same aristocratic sense of equality
with all living creatures and the same gift of taking in everything at
a glance and of expressing his thoughts as they first came to him and
before they had lost their meaning and vitality."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Doctor Zhivago</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Boris Pasternak was born into a prominent Jewish family in Moscow,
where his father, Leonid Osipovich Pasternak, was a professor at the
Moscow School of Painting. His mother, Rosa Kaufman, was an acclaimed
concert pianist. Their home was open to such guests as Sergei
Rachmaninoff, Aleksandr Scriabin, <a href="rmrilke.htm">Rainer Maria Rilke</a>, and 
<a href="ltolstoi.htm">Tolstoy</a>. Inspired by Scriabin, Palsternak 
entered the Moscow Conservatory, but gave up suddenly his musical ambitions in 1910. He 
then studied philosophy under Prof. Herman Cohen at the Marburg University in Germany, and 
returned to Moscow in the winter of 1913-14. </p>

<p>As a poet Pasternak made his debut with the collection&nbsp;<em>Bliznets v tuchakh</em>
 (1914). During World War I Pasternak worked as a
private tutor and at a chemical factory in the Ural Mountains. Due to a leg injury he did not serve in the army. The 
journey to the Ural gave him material for <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>.
Although Pasternak was horrified by the brutality of the new
government, he supported the Revolution. His parents and sisters
migrated to Germany in 1921, when travel abroad was legalized. Leonid
Pasternak died in Oxford in 1945. </p>

<p>After the Revolution of 1917 Pasternak worked as a librarian. With 
the books <i>Over the Barriers</i> (1917) and <i>My Sister - Life</i>
(1922) he gained fame as a prominent new poet. Pasternak's father
proudly mentioned this in a letter he wrote in German to Rilke: "If
only you knew how my children cherish your every line&nbsp;&#8211; especially
my elder son, Boris, who is a young poet already acclaimed in Russia.
He is your most ardent admirer, one who thoroughly appreciates you,
who, I may even say, calls himself your pupil; he was one of the first
to spread your fame in our country, where you were as yet unknown." In
the early 1920s Pasternak wrote autobiographical and political poetry,
and some short stories, which were collected in <i>The Childhood of Luvers</i> (1922). His memoir 'Safe Conduct' (1930) was continued in 'I Remember' (1959). Pasternak
married in 1922 Evgeniia Vladimirovna Lourie. They hand one son, but the 
marriage dissolved in 1931. In 1934 he married Zinaida Nikolaevna 
Neigauz. </p>

<p>From the mid-1920s Pasternak moved away from personal themes and
focused his attention to the meaning the Revolution, and to historical
and moral problems. When the Writer's Union increasingly imposed on the
doctrine of socialist realism, he gradually ceased to
produce original work. Socialist themes did not attract Pasternak. His
concept of realism was not the same as the official doctrine. "We cease
to recognize reality," Pasternak wrote in 'Safe Conduct.' "It manifests
itself in some new category. And this category appears to be its own
inherent condition and not our own. Apart from this condition
everything in the world has a name. Only it is new and is not yet
named. We try to name it&nbsp;&#8211; and the result is art."</p>


<p>In the 1930s and 1940s Pasternak's works didn't gain authorities
favour and they were not printed. The Russian Association of
Proletarian Writers, RAPP, campaigned against the older literary types
and criticized Osip Mandel'shtam, Pasternak, and Vladimir Mayakovsky.
Pasternak was accused of subjectivism and aestheticism, but Stalin's
respect of Pasternak, who did not die in the <a href="alesol.htm">Gulag Archipelago</a>, remains one of the mysteries 
of the Soviet dictator's behavior, who even took time to correct L.M. Leonov's <i>Russian Forest</i>
with a red pencil. According to a famous story, he had once a telephone
conversation with Stalin, who asked whether he was present when a
lampoon about himself, Stalin, was recited by Mandel'shtam. <br>
</p>
      <p>Unable to publish his own poetry 
Pasternak became a translator, selecting works from such authors as 
<a href="shakespe.htm">William Shakespeare </a>(Hamlet), 
<a href="goethe.htm">J.W. von Goethe</a> (Faust), Heinrich Kleist 
(Prinz Friedrich von Homburg), <a href="verlaine.htm">Paul Verlaine</a> 
and Rainer Maria Rilke&nbsp;&#8211; in the late 1920s he translated Rilke's 'Requiem für eine Freundin.' In his translation of <i>Hamlet</i>
Pasternak intepreted the play as a tragedy of duty and self denial.
With Rilke he had a brief correspondence, which was cut short by the
poet's death. In 1935 he travelled to Paris to participate in the
Anti-Fascist Congress. André Malraux, the organizer of the congress,
had made the journey possible with his persistence. </p>


<p>During World War II Pasternak wrote patriotic verses, and published 
a collection of poems,&nbsp; <em>Na&nbsp;rannikh poyezdakh</em>&nbsp;(1943).
From the elliptical expression of his earlier work he moved toward
disciplined simplicity. At the same time he had lost a number of his
old readers, intellectuals, who had been sent to prison camps, the
gulag archipelago. Like <a href="aakhma.htm">Anna Akhmatova</a>, he received letters from soldiers quoting from both published and unpublished poems. Another collection 
appeared in 1945, followed by a selection of earlier poetry in 1947. The Soviet literary journal<i> Znamya </i>published his lyrics under the title 'Poems from a Novel' (1954), where the novel referred to <i>Doktor Zhivago</i>. His last book of poetry was <i>When the Weather Clears</i>
(1960), written through the 1950s. As in his earlier verse, he used
religious motifs and drew parallels with art and death. "With secret
trembling, to the end, / I will thy long and moving service / In tears
of happiness attend". Pasternak did not write political poems, his view
was personal, which was considered a political statement by the
authorities.</p>
      <p>Before the Swedish Academy decided to award the Nobel Prize for Literature to Pasternak,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>  Dag Hammarskjöld, who was a member of 
the academy and secretary-general of the United Nations, approached the American 
and Soviet sides to learn their reactions to Pasternak's candidacy. Soviet 
Foreign Minister Gromyko was asked whether his country would consider acceptable 
jointly granting the prize to <a href="solohov.htm">Sholokhov</a> and Pasternak. Gromyko reportedly said, 
"Yes, Pasternak is well known as a good poet and translator, but Sholokhov is to 
us personally a greater writer" <font size="-1">(<span style="font-style: italic;">Boris Pasternak: His Life and Art</span> by Guy de 
Mallac, 1981, p. 225).</font> Following Pasternak's expulsion from the Writers' 
Union, Sholokhov, who became a Nobel laureate in 1965, said in an interview that Pasternak got the prize not because 
of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Doctor Zhivago</span>'s artistic value but 
because of its "anti-Soviet tendency." <br>
 </p>

<blockquote><i>Doktor Zhivago</i><i> </i>was rejected by the Soviet journal <i>Novye Mir</i>.
It was published first in Russian and in Italian translation by the
publisher
Feltrinelli in Milan in 1957, after the Italian journalist Sergio
D'Angelo had smuggled the manuscript out of Russia. The English
translation appeared in 1958. Pasternak probably completed the work in
1954, it had started in 1945, after the death of his father. During the
writing process, only some poetical excerpts were published in Moscow.
From 1960 on, rumors circulated that the novel would be published in
the Soviet Union. In spite of the ban,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Doktor Zhivago</span> circulated in samizdat copies and foreign editions.&nbsp; </blockquote>
<blockquote>The title of the novel refers to the Russian word "zizn", which means "life". In the
Soviet Union the book was banned for three decades &#8211; <i>Novye Mir </i>considered its spirit that of "nonacceptance of the socialist revolution"&nbsp;&#8211; and did not appear until 1988 in <i>Novye Mir</i>, a sign of changing times. </blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Doctor Zhivago</i> has been recognized by many as the
greatest Russian novel
of the 20th century. It is partly autobiography and partly epic novel,
a many-layered story starting from the year 1903, when Iurii Zhivago's
mother died. His father, a rich industrialist, commits suicide through
the malign influence of his lawyer, Komarovskii. The boy is brought up
in the Gromenko family. Durig this time Zhivago finds his call to
poetry and decides to become a doctor. Simultaneously Lara Guishar is
seduced in her teens by Komarovskii, and she marries Pasha Antipov.
Zhivago qualifies as a doctor, marries, and has a child. He meets Lara
during World War I, they fall in love. Throughout the story Zhivago and
Lara are repeatedly separated. He moves with his family to Urals after
the 1917 Revolution to escape the famine, and the Communists. There he
meets Lara. Zhivago
chooses a life with her, but is captured by local Boslhevik partisans.
Zhivago spends a long time in their forest camps. Eventually he escapes
and
makes his way back to Lara. Meanwhile his family has returned to
Moscow.
Komorovskii discovers Lara and Zhivago. They are promised a safe
conduct to the east. Lara follows with Komorowskii expecting that
Zhivago will
follow shortly. He meets Lara's husband Pasha, who commits suicide
disillusioned with the Revolution. Zhivago, a broken man, returns to
Moscow in 1922, on foot, and attempts to start a new life. He dies
in the street years later of a weak heart, in 1929. Lara reappears
before his burial. Zhivago's
friends collect his poetry. The story ends with a short episode,
occurring "five or ten years" after WW II, in which Zhivago's old
friends contemplate the fate of their country.&nbsp;&#8211; Zhivago was
partly modelled on Pasternak and Lara on his companion, Olga Ivanskaya,
who was arrested with her daughter after the death of the author. <font size="2"></font></blockquote>

<p>Pasternak's disagreement with Soviet Communism was not political but
rather based on his aesthetic views&nbsp;&#8211; he couldn't fully accept
official literary doctrines developed from a theory of class struggle
but followed his own principles. Already in 1923 he wrote in a poem: "I
was not born to look three times / Into the eyes of men. / Even more
senseless than song / Is the dull word ''foe."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>He thought little of Hemingway, found Sartre's <i>La Nausée </i>unreadable,
and did not consider Mayakovsky a major poet. In a personal letter to
the premier Nikita Khrushchev he expressed the hope that he would be
allowed to remain in his home country after continuing attacks against
his work. "Leaving the motherland will equal death for me. I am tied to
Russia by birth, by life and work." It is possible that Premier
Khrushchev used his influence to calm down attack on Pasternak. </p>

<p>Pasternak remained at Peredelkino, a writers's colony about twenty
miles outside of Moscow. His last projects included a play about
Aleksander II and the emancipation of the serfs. He also planned to
write another novel. Pasternak died from lung cancer on May 30, 1960.
In one poem he had written: "And keep on grinding / Everything that
happened to me / For almost forty years, / Into a churchyard compost."
At the funeral, people recited his poems, copies of 'August' was
distributed, and KGB informers took pictutes. One voice cried, "The
poet was killed!" and another responded: "Shame on them!" Pasternak's
son accepted his father's Nobel Prize medal at a ceremony in Stockholm
in 1989. "Pasternak loved Russia," said Isaiah Berlin in<i> The Proper Study of Mankind </i>(1998).
"He was prepared to forgive his country all its shortcomings, all, save
the barbarism of Stalin's reign; but even that, in 1945, he regarded as
the darkness before the dawn which he was straining his eyes to
detect&nbsp;&#8211; the hope expressed in the last chapters of <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>."</p>
<p><i>Doctor Zhivago</i> was adapted to the screen by David Lean in 1965,
together with the screenwriter Robert Bolt. Omar Sharif played the
title role as Yuri, and Julie Christie was Lara. The film, shot in
Spain and Finland, focused on the love story and used Yuri's
stepbrother Yevgraf as a narrator. A number of scenes and characters,
important for Pasternak's philosophical vision of the fate of his
generation, were omitted.<b> </b>When
the film was edited to its present 3 hours and 17 minutes, much of
Maurice Jarre's score was altered. In addition to the customary
symphonic instrumentation, there are 24 balalaika players from Los Angeles, Japanese
banjos, a Koto (7-foot Japanese harp), along with a six-foot gong,
organ, novachord, electric sonovox, harpsichord, electric piano, tack
piano, and zither. The composer himself felt upset by the overburdening repetition of
'Lara's Theme,' a simple love theme, which had litte to do with Russian folk songs or music of the period,
but which became a worldwide hit. All reviewers were not so positive: "... the biggest disappointment of
1965... There is nothing holding the effects together, not an idea, or
a feeling, or a mood, or even much of a plot, and a relatively capable
cast struggles helplessly with Robert Bolt's disconnected, uninspired
dialogue as the film bumbles along to boredom." (<font size="2">Andrew Sarris in </font><i><font size="2">Village Voice</font></i><font size="2">, December 30, 1965) </font></p>
