<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa tästä -->American science fiction and fantasy writer,
who often based his stories on myths and legends. Roger Zelazny was one
of the most important writers of the New Wave
of science fiction along with <a href="pkdick.htm">Philip
K. Dick</a>, Samuel R. Delany, Thomas M. Disch, <a href="leguin.htm">Ursula K. LeGuin</a>, and Harlan
Ellison. He published 50 novels, some 150 stories and three collections of poetry. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I do not have a soul. You do." </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">"A soul?" she laughed. "What's a soul? I've never seen
one. How do I know it's there? Even so, what good has it done to me?
I'd trade it in a twinkling to be like one of you. It's beyond my Art,
though." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Jack of Shadows</font></i><font size="2">, 1971) </font></blockquote>
<p>Roger Zelazny was born in Euclid, Ohio, the son of Joseph Frank
Zelazny, a Polish immigrant, and Josephine Flora Sweet. While attending
Euclid Senior High School, he published stories in the school's
litetary magazine, <i>Eucuyo</i>. In 1957, Zelazny enrolled at Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, graduating with a B.A. in English in
1959. He won the University's Finley Foster Poetry Prize in 1957 and in
1959 he won his second Finley Foster Prize and the Holden Essay Award
for an expanded term paper on Chaucer. Zelazny's early interest in judo
led him to study other martial arts, too, and he eventually gained a
black belt in Akido. </p>
<p>Zelazny received his M.A. in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama from
Columbia University in 1962. During this period, he was briefly
enlisted with the Ohio National Guard. After graduating Zelazny worked
for the Social Security Administration in Cleveland, Ohio, and in
Baltimore, Maryland, where he moved in 1965 after being promoted to
Claims Policy Specialist. In 1964 he married Sharon Steberl; they
separated within a year and divorced in 1966. Zelazny married then
Judith Alene Callahan, whom he had met in Baltimore. They had three
children, two sons and a daughter. From the mid-1990s, Zelazny lived
with Jane Lindskold, a writer and Ph.D. in English. Her biography on
Zelazny came out in 1993 in Twayne's American Author's series.</p>
<p>Zelazny's first published story was 'Passion Play', which appeared in <i>Amazing Stories</i>
in 1962. His father, who died in the early 1960s, never witnessed
Zelazny's breakthrough and success as a novelist. Before becoming a
full-time writer in 1969, Zelazny concentrated on short stories and
novellas. At the age of 38, Zelazny moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico,
where he lived until his death.</p>
<p>In the 1960s Zelazny became highly visible in a group of science
fiction writers known as the "New Wave". Up until that time the genre
had been dominated by writers producing action-adventures set in space.
The new generation felt that they had freedom to experiment; they
focused on psychology and believed science fiction should be taken
seriously as literature. Zelazny's novel <i>This Immortal </i>won the 1966 Hugo for Best Novel, and the self-mocking, immortal, jokester became Zelazny's favorite character type.  <i>The Dream Master</i> won the 1966 Nebula for Best Novella. In the same year <i>The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth</i> won a Nebula for Best Novellette.  'A Rose for Ecclesiastes,' published in the <i>Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> (1963), was selected as one of the most outstanding novelettes of the early sixties and included in <i>The Science Fiction Hall of Fame</i>: <i>Volume One, 1929&#8211;1964</i>
(1970, edited by Robert Silverberg). The story of a poet and
translator, who saves the Martian civilization, but is betrayed in
love, took one of its central symbols, the rose, from Rilke who used
the image throughout his poetry. </p>
<p><i>The Immortal </i>told of a post-apocalyptic Earth, which have
become a wasteland and place of entertainment for aliens, the Vegans.
Conrad Nomikos or "Konstantuin Kallikanzaros", the many-talented
Commissioner of Arts, Monuments and Archives for the planer Earth, is
employed as a guide to an alien official. The Vegans want to turn Earth
into a holiday resort, but Nomikos has his own ideas and he helps to
preserve the remnants of humanity. <i>The Dream Master </i>was about a
psychiatrists who is able to enter and affect his client's dreams &#8211; and
thus cure the neuroses of their patients. Its shorter version, 'He Who
Shapes' (1965) won a Nebula. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is no shame to lose to me, mortal. Even among mythical creatures there are very few who can give a unicorn a good game."</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">"I am pleased that you were not wholly bored," Martin
said. "Now will you tell me what you were talking about concerning the
destruction of my species?"</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Unicorn Variations', the Hugo Award in 1981)</font></blockquote>

<p>Zelazny's interest in magic, myths and dreams are already
at present in these early stories which are considered among his best
works. His heroes and villains are larger-than-life characters,
immortal or near-immortal, who are going through a process of growth
and self-discovery, or as Francis Sandow, the hero of<i> Isle of the Dead </i>(1969)
says, "I have been a coward, a god and a son of a bitch in my time,
among other things. That is one of the things about living for a very
long time. You go through phases." <i>Creatures of Light and Darkness</i> (1969) was inspired by the gods of ancient Egypt.  </p>
<p>In 1970 Zelazny started the enormously popular <i>Amber</i> series,
which have been adapted for comics and used as the basis for a computer
game. Zelazny spent much of his later life in the writing of this
series. The nine books, beginning with <i>Nine Princes in Amber,</i>
evoked the betrayals of Jacobean drama. The narrator Corwin and rival
princes and princesses double-cross one another, all seeking the crown.
Corwin's arch-rival is Eric, his brother. One of the siblings is
responsible for Corwin losing his memory in an automobile accident.
Noteworthy, Zelazny himself was involved in a serious car accident in
1964, outside of Mansfield, Ohio. His fiancée was a passenger, but both
survived without permanent physical injuries. Zelazny's face got cut up
from the broken mirrior pieces. </p>

<p>The first Chronicles of Amber included <i>Nine Princes in Amber</i>, <i>The Guns of Avalon</i> (1972), <i>Sign of the Unicorn</i> (1975), <i>The Hand of Oberon</i> (1976) and <i>The Courst of Chaos</i> (1978). <i>Triumps of Doom</i> (1985) opened a follow-up  featuring Corwin's son Merlin. This series continued in <i>Blood of Amber</i> (1986), <i>Sign of Chaos</i> (1987), <i>Knight of Shadows</i> (1989), and <i>Prince of Chaos </i>(1991). The first five novels were collected together as <i>The Chronicles of Amber</i> (2000). Two further related works were <i>A Rhapsody in Amber</i> (1981) and <i>Roger Zelazny's Visual Guide to Castle Amber</i> (1988, with Neil Randall). Zelasny's work was a forerunner to George R.R. Martin's <span style="font-style: italic;">A Game of Thrones</span>, hugely popular and highly acclaimed epic fantasy series. <br>
 </p>

<p>Amber is a higher, sophisticated plane, and the actions of its godlike inhabitants 
reflect in the human actions &#8211; humans being marionettes of gods. Corwin and his many 
siblings are more real than mortals, or the Gods of any Shadow realm &#8211; our world. 
The concept of Shadow has much in common with Plato's famous cave analogy and <a href="cjung.htm">Jungian</a> 
psychology. Jung considered the "shadow" the sum of those characteristics we wish 
to conceal  &#8211;  the most famous example found in literature is R.L. Stevenson's <i>Dr 
Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>. However, when the story continues, it turns out that Amber itself 
is not an ultimate reality, but shares a Ying-Yang relationship with the forces of Chaos. 
Zelazny's principal characters are sometimes mirror-images of one another, 
or symbols for the opposite forces of form and chaos, good and evil, life and death. 
</p>

<p>Unfaithful to genre boundaries, Zelazny relished the "science fantasy" form. In <i>Lord of Light </i>(1967)
he established a world ruled by gods, immortals equipped with
technological wonders. Human colonists have settled a distant planet.
They have developed a technology, which allows them to don godlike
personas. With their exotic weapons they and their psionic ability they
battle for power. The novel won a Hugo. "From then on his work &#8211; with
exceptions &#8211; was to call more on the stereotype of power fantasy than
an genuinely envisaged characters and scenarios," wrote Brian Aldiss
and David Wingrove in <i>Trillion year spree</i> (2001). However, in 1974 Zelazny was Guest of Honor at the World Science Fiction Convention, Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Zelazny collaborated with Philip K. Dick in <i>Deus Irae </i>(1976) &#8211; Dick could not finish the novel himself &#8211; and with Alfred Bester in <i>Psychoshop</i>
(1998) &#8211; Bester had died before completing the text. Zelazny considered
Dick a writer's writer, "rich enough in fancy that he can afford to
throw away in a paragraph ideas another writer might build a book
upon." However, in the mid-1970s Dick wasn't able work on his own any
more. His first collaborator on <span style="font-style: italic;">Deus Irae</span> had been Ted White, who lost his enthusiasm. Dick and Zelazny worked primarily through the mail. The collaboration turned out to be pleasant and productive. When Zelazny learned of Dick's financial straits, he voluntarily reduced his royalty from one-half to one third. <br>
</p>
      <p>The movie version of Zelazny's novel, <i>Damnation Alley</i>
(1969), was released in 1977. This post-Apocalypse adventure bore
little resemblance Zelazny's original work, which was inspired by
Hunter S. Thompson's book on the Hell's Angels, replacing the mean,
violent biker, the last of the breed, with decent Air Force officers.
Jack Smight, the director, was a veteran of television, known as a
craftsman of slick Hollywood entertainment. <br>
 </p>

<p>Among Zelazny's other works  are <i>Jack of Shadows </i>(1971), set on a non-rotating world whose dark side is run by magic, the "Wizard World" sequence <i>Changeling </i>(1980) and <i>Madwand </i>(1981), the "Dilvish" fantasies <i>The Changing Land</i> (1981) and <i>Dilvish the Damned</i> (1982). The comic <i>A Night in the Lonesome October </i>(1993)
recounts a gaslight romance with Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Jack The
Ripper and others, but has also a talking animal, Snuff, in the central
role. In the 1990s Zelazny published several books with Robert
Sheckley. One of the author's last works was <i>Wilderness </i>(1994),
written with Gerald Hausman. It tell true stories of two mountain men
in the Old West. Zelazny died of cancer on June 16, 1995, in Santa Fe,
at the age of 58.Zelazny's unpublished thriller about smuggling and missing church funds,  <i>The Dead Man's Brother</i>,
was published by Hard Case Crime in 2009, with an afterword by the
author&#8217;s son, Trent Zelazny. The manuscript had been lost among
Zelazny's papers for more than 30 years. </p>
