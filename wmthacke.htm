<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>




<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English journalist, novelist, famous for
his novel <em>Vanity Fair </em>(1847-48),
a tale of two middle-class London families. Most of Thackeray's major
novels were published as monthly serials. Thackeray studied in a
satirical and moralistic light upper- and middle-class English
life&nbsp;&#8211; he was once seen as the equal of his contemporary Dickens,
or even as his superior. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"This I set as a positive truth. A woman with fair opportunities, and without a positive hump, may marry whom she likes."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Vanity Fair</font></i><font size="2">) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>William Makepeace Thackeray was born in Calcutta, India, the only
son of Richmond Thackeray, a Collector in the East Indian Company's
service. After his father died he was sent to home to England. He was
educated at Charterhouse and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Thackeray
abandoned his studies without taking a degree, having lost some of his
inheritance of twenty thousand pounds through gambling. In the
beginning of the 1830s he visited Germany, where he met <a href="goethe.htm">Goethe</a>.</p>
<p>During 1831-33 Thackeray studied law at the Middle Temple, London,
but had little enthusiasm to continue his studies. In 1833 he brought
with a large heritage the <i>National Standard,</i> but lost his
fortune a year later in the Indian bank failures and other bad
investments. According to an anecdote, Thackeray offered to undertake
the task of illustrating Dickens's P<i>ickwick Papers </i>in 1836, but the author himself found Thackeray's drawings unsuitable.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>

<p>After art studies in Paris, Thackeray returned in 1837 to London and
started his career as a hard working journalist.
Often he used absurd pen names such as George Savage Fitz-Boodle,
Michael Angelo Titmarsh, Théophile Wagstaff, and C.J. Yellowplush, Esq.
Like
Dickens, he was a staunch opponent of the death penalty. When&nbsp;
François Benjamin Courvoisier was hanged for the murder of&nbsp; Lord
William Russell, Thackeray was there, among the crowd with Dickens,
witnessing it. His impressions he recorded in the essay 'Going to See a
Man Hanged' (1840). Thackeray noted that "the mob was extraordinarily
gentle and good-humoured" and confessed that "I feel myself ashamed and
degraded at the brutal curiosity which took me to that brutal sight;
and that I pray to Almighty God to cause this disgraceful sin to pass
from among us, and to cleanse our land of blood." <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1836 Thackeray married a poor Irish girl, Isabella Shawe;
they had three daughters. Their first child, Anne Thackeray Ritchie
(1837-1919), became a writer&nbsp;&#8211; her impressionistic texts impressed
<a href="vwoolf.htm">Virginia Woolf</a>, who drew a portrait of her in <i>Night and Day</i> (1919) as 'Mrs Hilbery.'<font size="2"> </font>Ritchie
(1837-1919) published several novels, and contributed to an 1898-99
edition of her father's works. A prominent intellectual figure of her
time and well-acquainted with a number of the great names of British
literature, she also wrote memoirs of her contemporaries, including <a href="tennyson.htm">Tennyson</a> (1809-1892) and the critic and art historian John Ruskin (1819-1900). </p>

<p>Thackeray began to contribute regularly to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> and <i>The Times</i>. His writings attracted first attention in <i>Punch</i>, where he satirized English snobbery. These sketches reappeared in 1848 as <em>The Book of Snobs</em>, in which he stated that "he who meanly admires mean things is a Snob." </p>
<p>In 1840 Isabella Thackeray suffered a mental breakdown, from which
she never recovered, through she survived Thackeray by thirty years.
The author was forced to send his children to France to his mother. The
children returned to England in 1846 to live with him. </p>
<p>Already in his first novel,&nbsp;<em>Catherine</em> (1839), originally written for <i>Fraser's Magazine,</i>
Thackeray broke with the literary conventions of his day: "The
characters of the tale ARE immoral, and no doubt of it; but the writer
humbly hopes the end is not so. The public was, in our notion, dosed
and poisoned by the prevailing style of literary practice, and it was
necessary to administer some medicine that would produce a wholesome
nausea, and afterwards bring about a more healthy habit." </p><p><em>The Luck of Barry Lyndon</em>
(1844), portrayed an adventurer, opportunist, and gambler, who serves
in the Seven Years War, first under the English flag and then in the
Prussian army, gains wealth, and eventually is punished for his
imperfections. "Suppose in a game of life&nbsp;&#8211; and it is but a
twopenny game after all&nbsp;&#8211; you are equally eager of winning,"
Thackeray wrote much later in 'Autour de mon Chapeau' (1863). "Shall
you be ashamed of your ambition, or glory in it?" </p>
<p>In <i>Vanity Fair </i>, set at the time of the Napoleonic wars,
Thackeray created one of the most fascinating immoral female
characters, Becky Sharp, who manages to avoid the fate of Barry Lyndon:
"I think I could be a good woman if I had five thousand a year." <font size="2">(from <i>Vanity Fair</i>) </font>The
book brought Thackeray prosperity and made him an established author
and popular lecturer in Europe and in the United States.
</p>
<blockquote><i>Vanity Fair</i> was sub-titled 'A Novel without a Hero'.
"Everybody in Vanity Fair must have remarked how well those live who
are comfortably and thoroughly in debt; how they deny themselves
nothing; how jolly and easy they are in their minds." The vast
satirical panorama of a materialistic society centers on Becky Sharp
and Amelia Sedley, good-natured but 'silly.' They are two
boarding-school friends, whose destinies are contrasted. Clever and
ambitious Becky is born into poverty as the daughter of a penniless
artist. Her plans to marry Amelia's brother Joseph fail. She marries
Rowdon Crawley, but he is disinherited. Becky manages to live at the
height of fashion through the patronage of Lord Steyne. When her
husband discovers the truth, he departs to become the governor of
Coventry Island. Becky is ostracized and she moves to the Continent. In
the meantime Amelia's stockbroker father is ruined. Amelia is loved by
William Dobbin but she marries George Osborne&nbsp;&#8211; he dies in the
battle of Waterloo. Amelia's son is left into the care of his
grandfather, who dies and leaves him a fortune. Amelia travels in the
Continent with his brother and they meet Becky. Dobbin has returned
from India and disapproves Amelia's kindness to Becky. Older and
disillusioned, Dobbin and Amelia can marry. Becky regains her hold over
Joseph, who dies in suspicious circumstances. Becky's husband Rowdon
dies, and Becky ends the novel in the guise of a pious widow. <font size="2">(<b>See also</b>: </font><a href="trollope.htm"><font size="2">Anthony Trollope</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="minnes.htm"><font size="2">Michael Innes</font></a><b><font size="2">)</font></b></blockquote>
<p>Thackeray's increasing love for Jane Brookfield, the
 wife of an old Cambridge friend, led to a rupture in their friendship.<em> The History of Henry Esmond, Esq</em>., appeared in three volumes in 1852, and reflected the melancholic period in the life of the author. <b><font size="2"></font></b>By the end of his career, Thackeray's disillusionment with contemporary culture seems to have deepened. In <em>The Adventures of Philip</em> (1862) the protagonist, Philip, is out of place in a world that does not accommodate his vision of masculinity. </p>
<p>Thackeray said that he couldn't start a novel until he knew every
aspect of his characters. He called Victorian times "if not the most
moral, certainly the most squeamish." Once, as an editor, he rejected
an <a href="ebrownin.htm">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a> poem because it employed the word harlot. Thackeray became in 1860 the first editor of the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, for which he wrote his <em>Roundabout Papers</em>, <em>Lovel the Widower</em>, <em>The Adventures of Philip</em> and the unfinished <em>Denis Duval</em>. Less successful Thackeray was with his attempt to stand for Parliament. His contacts with friendly rival <a href="dickens.htm">Charles Dickens</a>
&nbsp;ended in a quarrel, but their daughters continued to be friends.
Thackeray died suddenly on Christams Eve 1863. Just before his death he
he had reconciled with Dickens. </p>
<p>Thackeray was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. His bust at the
Westminster Abbey was made by the Italian sculptor Marachetti. The
poet's daughter was not satisfied with the work and let another
sculptor to modify her father's stone sideburns until they were the
right length. </p>
