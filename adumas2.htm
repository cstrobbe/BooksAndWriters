<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->French playwright and novelist,
illegitimate son of <a href="adumas1.htm">Alexandre Dumas</a> <em>père</em>,
who,&nbsp;at the time of his son's birth, was still an aspiring writer.
Dumas <em>fils </em>gained fame with his novel <i>La Dame aux
Camélias</i>, in which a fallen girl, Marguerite, gives up her lover
rather than see him become a social outcast. The story has been filmed
several times. It is based partly on the life of Rose Alphonsine
Plessis. She moved to Paris at the age of 14 and became in two years
the lover of several important men. Rose took another name, Marie
Duplessis, but in Dumas' novel she was Marguerite Gautier and in
Verdi's opera Violetta Valéry. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In my opinion, it is impossible to
create characters until one has spent a long time studying men, as it
is impossible to speak language until it has been seriously acquired.
Not being old enough to invent, I content myself with narrating, and I
beg the reader to assure himself&nbsp;of the truth of a story in which
all the characters, with the exception of the heroine, are alive."</b>
(in<em> Camille: The Lady of the Camellias</em></font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Alexandre Dumas fils was born in Paris. His mother,
Marie-Catherine Labay, was a dressmaker. In 1831 he was legally
recognized by his father and taken from Marie-Catherine, who first
tried to escape with her son. Later she inspired Dumas' mother
characters; he often depicted the fate of unmarried women in a tragic
light. In boarding schools, where&nbsp;Dumas was sent, he was made
miserable by his schoolmates who taunted him about his illegitimate
birth. He never forgave them.&nbsp;After studies&nbsp;
at the Institution Goubaux and the Collége Bourbon, he abandoned
further education to devote himself to writing. </p>
      <p>At first, Dumas had no success, and by the time he was twenty
one, he was hugely in debt. In 1844 Dumas père separated from his wife
and Dumas <i>fils</i> moved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye to live with his
father. There he met Marie Duplessis, a young woman from Nonant, who
was at the age of sixteen one of the most sought-after courtisans in
Paris. In 1844 she became Dumas' mistress, but the love of her life was
the composer Franz Liszt. Marie Duplessis died of tuberculosis in
February 1847 and inspired Dumas' romantic novel,<i> La Dame aux
Camélias</i>, which he wrote in three weeks. It was adapted into a
play, known in English as <i>Camille</i>. </p>
      <p>At first the&nbsp;stage version&nbsp;was rejected by one
theater after another. Moreover, the censors of the French Republic
regarded it as too scandalous. Finally, after the coup d'état&nbsp;of
Napoleon III,&nbsp;it was produced by Théâtre du Vaudeville. Giuseppe
Verdi based his opera<i> La traviata</i> on the play, first performed
in 1853. Its premiere in Venice was a fiasco, but after various
alterations to the score and with a different cast, the opera soon
became&nbsp;highly popular,&nbsp;though some critics remained
unimpressed: "An unfortunate young person who has acted the part of a
public prostitute . . . coughs her way through three acts," wrote the
London <em>Times</em> in 1856. Originally the working&nbsp;title of
the opera was<em> Amore e morte</em>, but it was changed at the
insistence of the Venetian censors. Marguerite, whose name means <em>daisy</em>
in French, was turned into Violetta. The role of the heroine&nbsp;is
considered one of the most difficult in the soprano repertory. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Business? It's quite simple. It's
other people's money."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">La Question
d'Argent</font></i><font size="2">, 1857) </font></blockquote>
      <p>The play made the novel a huge success and enabled Dumas <i>fils
      </i>to pay off some of his debts and help his mother. Before 1852
he wrote twelve other novels and started to work on didactic plays that
showed a distaste for loose loving.&nbsp; <em>Diane de Lys</em> (1853)
was based on his relationship with the wife of the Russian ambassador
to France. <i>A Prodigal Father </i>(1859) was an interpretation of
his father's character. He formed a liaison with the Russian Nadeja
Naryschkine, who was married. They had a daughter in 1860 and four
years later they married. In 1867 Dumas published his
semi-autobiographical novel,<em> L' Affaire Clemenceau</em>, which is
considered one of his best works. It&nbsp;has also served
as&nbsp;a&nbsp;source for Henry James's bildungsroman <em>Roderick
Hudson</em> (1876). James said of Dumas in a letter that "he is
detestable &amp; a childish charlatan: but as a dramatist, I think he
understands&nbsp;the business like none of the others." </p>
      <p>Dumas was admitted to the Académie Francaise in 1874. He wrote
several plays, among which <em>Denise</em> (1885) and <em>Francillon</em>
(1887) gained considerable success. In 1894 he was admitted to the
Légion d'Honneur. After his wife died Dumas married Henriette Régnier,
who had been his mistress for eight years. His last play, <i>The
Return from Thebes</i>, was left unfinished. Dumas died at Marly-le-Roi
on November 27, 1895. On the day of his funeral, mourners took flowers
from his grave and placed them on the nearby tomb of Alphonsine
Plessis, who was believed to be the real 'Lady of the Camellias'; Dumas
himself was the 'Armand Duval' of the <i>roman à clef</i>. </p>
      <p>In his works Dumas underlined the importance of marriage and
the moral purpose of literature. Playwrights have shown human beings as
they are, but they should show how they ought to be. Dumas was against
the emancipation of women, adultery and prostitution, and wrote sharp
prefaces to his plays to make their high intentions more obvious.
Dumas' <i>Dame aux Camélias</i> and <i>The Half-World</i> (1855)
reflected the changing idea of love and family of the mid-1850s. A
woman with a doubtful reputation is a danger for the bourgeois family:
she must be removed from the social body as a center of infection. If
one has already seduced such a girl, then one should also marry her. If
one has brought an illegitimate child into the world, then one should
legitimize it, as Dumas pleads in his plays <i>The Natural Son </i>(1858)
and <em>Monsieur Alphonse</em>&nbsp; (1873). In certain circumstances
a man can be forgiven his adultery, a woman never. </p>
      <p>Dumas was of the opinion that there is no art at all in
inventing a dramatic situation and thinking out a conflict. The art
consists rather in the due preparation of the scene in which the plot
culminates and in the smooth unraveling of the knot. The development of
the plot must be like a mathematical operation. If the result is wrong,
the whole operation is wrong. Therefore one must begin working on the
end, the solution, the last word of the play. </p>
      <p><i>La dame aux camélias</i> (1852, Camille; The Lady of the
Camelias). "In my opinion, it is impossible to create characters until
one has spent a long time in studying men, as it is impossible to speak
a language until it has been seriously acquired. Not being old enough
to invent, I content myself with narrating, and I beg the reader to
assure himself of the truth of a story in which all the characters,
with the exception of the heroine, are still alive." The story is
narrated by the writer Armand Duval, his friend. Marguerite Gautier is
a beautiful young courtesan suffering from tuberculosis. She is loved
by Armand Duval, but their happiness ends abruptly, when M. Duval,
Armand's father refuses to accept their relationship. He asserts that
their romance will destroy his son's career and social position, also
it prevents the marriage of his younger sister. Marguerite leaves her
lover, pretending to be returning to a rich admirer. Armand follows her
to Paris and wounds his rival in a duel and is forced to leave France.
Marguerite's fortunes deteriorate rapidly, she is deserted by lovers
and friends and moves to a shabby flat. Armand's father writes to his
son of Marguerite's sacrifice and misfortunes. Armand returns to
Marguerite's side and she dies in his arms. "I do not draw from this
story the conclusion that all women like Marguerite are capable of
doing all that she did--far from it; but I have discovered that one of
them experienced a serious love in the course of her life, that she
suffered for it, and that she died of it. I have told the reader all
that I learned. It was my duty." </p>
